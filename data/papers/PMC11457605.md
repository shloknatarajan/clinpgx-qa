## Abstract

Aim: We aimed to define the influence of P2Y12 polymorphisms (rs6801273, rs2046934, and rs6809699), diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, statins intake, and smoking habit on clopidogrel therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Materials & methods: We used PCR-RFLP and PCR-ASO for P2Y12 genotype analysis. The effectiveness of the therapy was measured with the VerifyNow method and defined in platelet reactivity units.

Results: Studied polymorphisms had no statistically significant influence on PRU before (PRU0) and 6 months (PRU6) after the procedure. H1/H1 diabetic carriers had significantly higher PRU6 values than patients without diabetes. Obese H1/H2 subjects had significantly lower PRU6 values than H1/H2 non-obese carriers.

Conclusion: We found that obesity and diabetes may influence the long-term outcome of antiplatelet therapy.

## 1. Background

A percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a medical procedure used to unblock or widen coronary arteries in patients with arteriosclerosis. Although it is minimally invasive, antiplatelet therapy is required to lower the potential risk of coronary thrombosis in patients.

In the first phase of blood coagulation, two receptors from the P2Y subfamily are involved – P2Y_1_ and P2Y_12_. The P2Y_12_ receptor enables platelets to bind with fibrinogen and their subsequent aggregation. It is also a molecular target for antiplatelet drugs, such as clopidogrel. By binding to the active center of the receptor, they prevent the attachment of the agonist (adenosine monophosphate) and thus block the signal pathway. As a result, GP IIb/IIIa protein is not activated, and it cannot attach fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor, which is a crucial step in platelet aggregation. Hence, we observe inhibited clot formation [[1–5](#CIT00001)].

Many studies showed that outcomes of antiplatelet therapy could differ significantly between patients. Differences in response to the treatment may occur due to low concentrations of the drug or its active metabolite (as is the case with clopidogrel) and other factors such as obesity, smoking habits, comorbidities, and drug interactions [[6–10](#CIT00006)]. They may result in a reduced response to antiplatelet therapy, significantly increasing the risk of thrombotic events in patients.

A novel P2Y_12_ inhibitor – selatogrel, completed Phase II studies and proved to be effective in patients with myocardial infarction [[8](#CIT00008),[11](#CIT00011),[12](#CIT00012)]. As a still developing pharmacological group, it should be investigated and factors possibly influencing therapy outcomes could be found. Investigation of genetic variations in the *P2Y12* gene may provide information regarding their influence on antiplatelet treatment.

Available research mentions several polymorphisms that may be influential for P2Y_12_ treatment: rs2046934 (T774C) and rs6809699 (G52T) [[13](#CIT00013),[14](#CIT00014)]. The influence of T744C and G52T polymorphisms on clopidogrel therapy was widely studied, but their influence on platelet aggregation in patients treated with clopidogrel remains unclear. Information on other polymorphisms, such as rs6801273, is also ambiguous. There are also some discrepancies regarding their influence. For instance, Fontana et al. claim that they significantly alter outcomes of antiplatelet therapy [[15](#CIT00015)], impairing the treatment efficacy, while other researchers did not confirm it [[16–18](#CIT00016)]. Nie et al. [[16](#CIT00016)] studied the influence of five haplotypes (H_0_ – H_5_) on high on-treatment platelet reactivity. They observed that T744C polymorphism was not associated with high on-treatment platelet reactivity and concluded that a combination of common variations of *P2Y12* might be responsible. Angiolillo et al. [[17](#CIT00017)] reported a lack of association between T744C polymorphism and diverse responses to clopidogrel treatment. In their research, Ziegler et al. [[17](#CIT00017)] observed a diverse response to clopidogrel therapy in PAD (peripheral artery disease) patients. They pointed at C34T and G52T polymorphisms as possible factors. As their results were inconclusive, they stated that this subject should be investigated further. Moreover, these studies did not consider other factors, such as comorbidities, drug interactions, and smoking habits, which may have an additional impact on antiplatelet activity and the interpretation of the results obtained [[19–24](#CIT00019)].

Because of these differences, we investigated the effect of genetic polymorphisms T744C, G52T, and rs6081273 of the platelet receptor P2Y_12_ on the clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in patients undergoing PCI. We also considered the influence of diabetes, hypertension, smoking habits, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and statin intake to comprehend multifactorial dependencies better.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Studied population

For this research, agreement from the Bioethical Committee associated with the Poznan University of Medical Sciences was obtained (study approval number: 58/20; study approved on 16 January 2020). Informed consent was gained individually from all patients included in the study. All performed procedures were in accordance with the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study group included 58 patients undergoing PCI. The samples were collected in the Department of Cardiology, Cardiovascular Unit, at J. Strus Hospital (Poznan, Poland) and in the Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Angiology and Phlebology at Poznan University of Medical Sciences on Długa ½ Street (Poznań, Poland). Patients were treated with 75 mg/day of clopidogrel at least 7 days before and 6 months after the procedure. Patients who were not treated with clopidogrel before treatment were given 300 mg of clopidogrel loading dose, 7 days before the procedure. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed by platelet reactivity measurement (VerifyNow), expressed in platelet reactivity units (PRU) on the day of therapy (PRU^0^) and after 6 months (PRU^6^). We assumed that PRU values should be in the range of 60–240 PRU [[25](#CIT00025)]. Based on PRU^0^ and PRU^6^ values, the study group was divided into three phenotypes: with high PRU>208 (HPR), low PRU<95 (LPR), and normal 95<PRU<208 (NPR) PRU values [[26](#CIT00026)]. Characteristics of the study group are presented in [Table 1](#T0001).

Blood samples used for genotyping were collected with S-Monovette systems, with EDTA as an anticoagulant, and were stored at -80°C. Blood samples necessary for the measurement of platelet aggregation were collected into Vacuvette systems containing sodium citrate. DNA isolation was performed with GeneMATRIX Quick Blood Purification Kit (EURx, Poland), following the manufacturer's protocol.

### 2.2. Genetic analysis

#### 2.2.1. T744C & rs6801273 genotyping

T744C and rs6801273 polymorphisms were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR). The optimum temperatures of the primers were established by conducting a PCR reaction in a temperature gradient.

Conditions of the RFLP-PCR reaction and its products are shown in Supplementary Table S1 & Supplementary Figure S1. Restriction products were separated in 3% agarose gel for rs6801273 and 2% for T744C (5 V/cm). We visualized our results using a system for gel documentation with an LED transilluminator (470 nm). Exemplary results are shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

#### 2.2.2. G52T genotyping

For the G52T allele-specific nucleotide polymerase chain reaction (PCR-ASO) was used. The optimum temperature for primers was assessed by conducting a PCR reaction in a temperature gradient.

Reaction included two separate steps. First, a longer fragment surrounding the mutation site (outside fragment) was amplified with a length of 164 base pairs. Next, two parallel PCR reactions were performed, using the product obtained in the previous step. The same forward primer was used in both cases, but the reverse primers were replaced with allele-specific ones (Supplementary Table S2). We visualized our results using a system for gel documentation with an LED transilluminator (470 nm) on 2% agarose gel. Exemplary results are shown in Supplementary Figure S2.

#### 2.2.3. Sequencing

We confirmed our interpretation of results with Sanger sequencing. For this purpose, seven samples were randomly selected, one for each observed genotype, regarding all studied polymorphisms.

The results were analyzed using the Finch TV (Digital World Biology) program, available from [https://digitalworldbiology.com/FinchTV](https://digitalworldbiology.com/FinchTV) website [[27](#CIT00027)].

### 2.3. Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis focused on establishing the influence of studied genotypes and haplotypes on the change in PRU within 6 months, the prevalence of responders and nonresponders at the beginning of the study and after 6 months, establishing the impact of comorbidities on PRU^0^ and PRU^6^ values.

We performed statistical analysis using the Statistica 13 program (StatSoft Inc, USA). For each test, a significance level of 0.05 was assumed. To compare the normally distributed values on the day of the procedure and after 6 months, the Student's *t*-test for dependent variables was used. To compare normally distributed values in two independent groups, we used the Student's *t*-test for independent variables. For more than two groups in which the continuous variables were normally distributed, the one-way ANOVA test was used. For more than two groups in which the continuous variables were not normally distributed, the nonparametric Wilcoxon test was performed. We performed the Kruskal-Wallis test for more than two independent groups in which the variables were not normally distributed. We assessed the linkage disequilibrium of the studied population with the χ^2^ test.

We performed a linkage disequilibrium analysis with LDlink [[28](#CIT00028)]. As the base we chose European populations studied as a part of the 1000 Genomes Project.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Influence of P2Y12 polymorphisms & haplotypes

We found that both expected and observed frequencies of the genotypes were alike and remained in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genotype distribution of T744C, rs6801273, and G52T polymorphisms are shown in Supplementary Table S3. Visualization of the results obtained after restriction and allele-specific PCR are available in Supplementary Material (Supplementary Figures S1 & S2).

We found that studied polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium. Thus, further analysis was carried out for individual genotypes (for rs6801273) and after grouping them into haplotypes: H1 (T for T744C and G for G52T) and H2 (C for T744C and T for G52T) and A (T for T744C, G for G52T and T for rs6801273), B (T for T744C, G for G52T and C for rs6801273), C (C for T744C, T for G52T and T for rs6801273) haplotypes. Information about the genotypes included in each haplotype is provided in Supplementary Table S4.

#### 3.1.1. Effect of H1 & H2 haplotypes & rs6801273 polymorphism on platelet reactivity

We observed a slight decrease in platelet reactivity for both haplotype combinations. Although H1/H1 carriers showed better response through 6-month therapy (PRU^0^: 157.69 ± 12.91; PRU^6^: 144.14 ± 11.68, n = 29) than H1/H2 carriers (PRU^0^: 138.43 ± 16.00; PRU^6^: 152.75 ± 16.10, n = 7) ([Figure 1](#F0001)). However, these differences were not statistically significant (*p* < 0.05).

![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/332f/11457605/4ef1c4e76037/IFCA_A_2363712_F0001_C.jpg)

Comparison of platelet reactivity values before procedure and after 6 months of clopidogrel treatment in patients with H1/H1 (n = 29) and H1//H2 (n = 7) haplotypes combination. Results are presented as mean values ± 0.95* confidence interval. Regarding H1/H1 haplotype combination p = 0.5395 and for H1/H2 haplotype p = 0.5128. PRU: Platelet reactivity unit.

Regarding rs6801273, we observed almost no changes in PRU median values through therapy in TT carriers (PRU^0^: 151 [97–173]; PRU^6^: 158.00 [110–178], n = 22) and TC carriers TC (PRU^0^: 156 [123–201]; PRU^6^: 158 [89–205]). Contrary, median platelet reactivity decreased in patients carrying the CC genotype (PRU^0^: 202.5 [187–216]; PRU^6^: 139 [116–179]). Despite observed results, statistical analysis did not prove them significant ([Figure 2](#F0002)).

![Figure 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/332f/11457605/86205b58186d/IFCA_A_2363712_F0002_C.jpg)

Changes of platelet reactivity unit values through clopidogrel therapy (at the time of the procedure – 0, and after 6 months of treatment – 6), depending on the genotype TC (n = 13), TT (n = 17), CC (n = 6), for the rs6801273 polymorphism. Results are presented as median (min-max). Regarding TC genotype p = 0.6092, while for TT and CC p = 0.7652 and p = 0.8886, respectively. PRU: Platelet reactivity unit.

#### 3.1.2. Analysis of the influence of H1, H2 haplotypes & rs6801273 polymorphism on observed phenotypes

[Table 2](#T0002) presents the prevalence of poor- and well-responding phenotypes in carriers of H1 and H2 haplotypes. The number of HPR patients with H1/H1 haplotype decreased to a greater extent during the 6-month observation (PRU^0^ 16.67%, PRU^6^ 5.56%) than in H1/H2 carriers (PRU^0^ 16.67%; PRU^6^ 10.00%). At the same time, H1/H2 subjects had more often NPR phenotype (PRU^0^ 75.00%; PRU^6^ 80.00%) than H1/H1 patients (PRU^0^ 66.67%; PRU^6^ 75.00%). None of the differences were statistically significant ([Table 2](#T0002)).

| Haplotype | Time [months] | HPR n/[%] | NPR n/[%] | LPR n/[%] | p-value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1/H1 | 0 | 6/16.67 | 24/66.67 | 6/16.67 | 0.7713 |
| H1/H2 | 2/16.67 | 9/75.00 | 1/8.33 |  |  |
| H1/H1 | 6 | 2/5.56 | 27/75.00 | 7/19.44 | 0.7174 |
| H1/H2 | 1/10.00 | 8/80.00 | 1/10.00 |  |  |

Table Caption: The influence of H1 and H2 haplotypes of normal, high, and low platelet reactivity status in the study group before (time 0) and 6 months after the procedure (time 6).

Regarding rs6801273 polymorphism, results are collected in [Table 3](#T0003). As shown, patients with TC genotype were the most responsive group. In this subgroup, we observed the greatest decrease in the number of nonresponders (HPR: PRU^0^ 27.78%; PRU^6^ 12.50%). For TT and CC carriers numbers of studied subgroups were limited. Moreover, all observed differences concerning TT, TC and CC genotypes were not statistically significant.

| Genotype | Time [months] | HPR n/[%] | NPR n/[%] | LPR n/[%] | p-value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TC | 0 | 5/27.78 | 10/55.56 | 3/16.67 | 0.2252 |
| TT | 1/4.76 | 16/76.19 | 4/19.05 |  |  |
| CC | 2/22.22 | 7/77.78 | 0/0.00 |  |  |
| TC | 6 | 2/12.50 | 10/62.50 | 4/25.00 | 0.4009 |
| TT | 0/0.00 | 18/85.71 | 3/14.29 |  |  |
| CC | 1/11.11 | 7/77.78 | 1/11.11 |  |  |

Table Caption: The influence of rs6801273 genotype on the prevalence of normal, high, and low platelet reactivity status in the study group before (time 0) and 6 months after the procedure (time 6).

#### 3.1.3. Effect of A, B & C haplotypes on platelet reactivity

In the case of patients with the A/B haplotype, the PRU values at the beginning and after 6 months of treatment were very similar ([Figure 3](#F0003)). The greatest differences were observed for the B/B haplotype, where the PRU^6^ values turned out to be much lower than the PRU^0^ values. However, the observed differences were not statistically significant. In the case of patients with the B/C haplotype pattern, it was impossible to perform the analysis due to a very small study group (only one patient).

![Figure 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/332f/11457605/b61fbf51393a/IFCA_A_2363712_F0003_C.jpg)

Changes of platelet reactivity unit values through clopidogrel therapy (at the time of the procedure – 0, and after 6 months of treatment – 6), depending on different haplotype combinations A/A (n = 13), A/B (n = 14), A/C (n = 7), B/B (n = 7). Results are presented as median (min-max%). For A/B, p = 0.68324; A/C, p = 0.88864; A/A, p = 0.60018; B/B, p = 0.49896. PRU: Platelet reactivity unit.

#### 3.1.4. Analysis of the influence of A, B & C haplotypes on observed phenotypes

[Table 4](#T0004) presents how the prevalence of the platelet reactivity phenotypes changed during the 6 months long treatment according to the A/B/C haplotypes. Overall, the observed changes were limited and not statistically significant. The greatest number of nonresponders with HPR was observed in B haplotype carriers, but their number and fraction decreased as the treatment continued.

| Haplotype | Time [months] | HPR n/[%] | NPR n/[%] | LPR n/[%] | p-value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A/A | 0 | 1/7.14 | 10/71.43 | 3/21.43 | 0.3919 |
| A/B | 3/21.43 | 8/57.14 | 3/21.43 |  |  |
| A/C | 0/0.00 | 6/85.71 | 1/14.29 |  |  |
| B/B | 2/25.00 | 6/75.00 | 0/0.00 |  |  |
| B/C | 2/50.00 | 2/50.00 | 0/0.00 |  |  |
| A/A | 6 | 0/0.00 | 11/78.57 | 3/21.43 | 0.1380 |
| A/B | 1/7.14 | 10/71.43 | 3/21.43 |  |  |
| A/C | 0/0.00 | 7/100.00 | 0/0.00 |  |  |
| B/B | 1/12.50 | 6/75.00 | 1/12.50 |  |  |
| B/C | 1/50.00 | 0/0.00 | 1/50.00 |  |  |

Table Caption: The influence of A/B/C haplotypes on the prevalence of normal, high, and low platelet reactivity status in the study group before (time 0) and 6 months after the procedure (time 6).

### 3.2. Analysis of other potentially influencing factors

Based on collected data, we investigated the influence of: obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking habit, hypertension, statins intake on observed platelet reactivity on the day of the procedure and after 6 months. We compared PRU values independently from studied genotypes/haplotypes and after adjusting data accordingly to carried genotypes and H1/H1 or H1/H2 haplotype combinations. Collected results of our research can be found in Supplementary Tables S5–S9.

Regarding the initial PRU values (PRU^0^), none of the potential cofactors significantly influenced them, with or without the adjustment for H1/H2 haplotype (Supplementary Tables S5 & S6). The only significant dependencies were noticed for diabetic patients with higher PRU^6^ values than non-diabetic subjects (174.87 ± 46.24 vs. 135.34 ± 51.40, respectively, *p* = 0.0165).

After dividing patients according to carried haplotypes and genotypes, the negative influence of diabetic status was also noticed in H1/H1 carriers 6 months after the procedure (Supplementary Table S7). Another factor was obesity; in these subjects who also carried H1/H2 haplotype, PRU^6^ values were significantly lower than in non-obese subgroup (107.33 ± 16.17 vs. 162.50 ± 24.61; *p* = 0.0105), but it was based on a small group of nine subjects (Supplementary Table S7).

When investigating rs6801273 genotypes (Supplementary Table S8 & S9), we found that TT carriers suffering from hypercholesterolemia had higher mean platelet reactivity on the day of the procedure (PRU^0^: 161.15 ± 3.67 vs. 108.25 ± 72.13; *p* = 0.0333).

## 4. Discussion

In this study, we investigated the possible effect of selected P2Y_12_ platelet receptor gene polymorphisms (T744C, G52T and rs6801273), comorbidities, and smoking habit on the platelet reactivity in patients after stent implantation, treated with clopidogrel. No studied polymorphisms or haplotypes had a direct, statistically significant influence on pharmacodynamic or observed phenotypes. We also analyzed the impact of: diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking habits, and obesity. We found that after 6-month clopidogrel treatment, H1/H1 diabetic carriers had higher PRU^6^ values than H1/H2 carriers. On the other hand, H1/H2 obese patients showed lower platelet reactivity than H1/H1 subjects.

We analyzed changes in PRU values during therapy. We found that patients with the CC genotype (rs6801273) had the highest mean PRU^0^ values but also experienced the greatest reduction in platelet reactivity after treatment. This decrease in the value of PRU may indicate the greatest effectiveness of therapy. Results showed that patients with the TT genotype had very similar mean values for PRU^0^ and PRU^6^, which may be due to an inadequate response to antiplatelet therapy in these patients. Despite the observed differences, the effect of individual genotypes on changes in PRU during therapy was not statistically significant. A similar influence of the *rs6801273* genotype was observed by Nie et al. [[16](#CIT00016)]. The authors did not notice significant differences in patients treated with clopidogrel (75 mg/24 h) and aspirin (100 mg/24 h), even after examining the effect of individual haplotypes that included rs6801273. Nie et al. [[16](#CIT00016)] also found that patients with haplotypes H1 and H2 (rs6801273 C allele) had a lower risk of increased platelet reactivity than patients with haplotype H0 (rs6801273 T allele).

We observed a slight decrease in platelet reactivity both for H1/H1 and an increase for H1/H2 carriers during the therapy. H1/H1 seemed to respond to treatment but not at a statistically significant level. Similar results were obtained by Beckerath et al. [[29](#CIT00029)], who observed no significant effect of G52T and T744C polymorphisms, which contribute to the H1/H2 haplotype, on clopidogrel therapy. Angiolillo et al. [[17](#CIT00017)] also reported no effect of T744C polymorphism on patient response to clopidogrel. On the other hand, Hassani Idrissi et al. [[13](#CIT00013)] discovered in their study that the C allele for the T744C polymorphism may be a predisposing factor for a reduced response in patients treated with clopidogrel. Reports of increased platelet aggregation in response to ADP, in the case of G52T polymorphism (TT genotype), appeared in the work of Kim et al. [[30](#CIT00030)]. Contrary to Fontana et al. [[15](#CIT00015)], the authors hypothesized that only the TT genotype was responsible for an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients and a reduced response to antiplatelet therapy.

A new aspect presented in this paper was grouping studied polymorphisms - rs6801273, G52T, and T744C - into haplotypes A, B, and C, which have not been discussed in the literature so far. A comparison of PRU^0^ and PRU^6^ values showed that the highest values of the median PRU^0^ can be observed for the A/A haplotype combination and the lowest PRU^6^ for B/B ([Figure 3](#F0003)). We concluded that haplotype A might be responsible for higher values of PRU^0^ and PRU^6^ in patients. However, a deeper analysis proved that the observed differences are not statistically significant.

When analyzing the change in platelet reactivity during therapy, the highest values occur in patients with the B/B combination. However, we also noticed the biggest decrease in platelet reactivity in B/B carriers over 6-month treatment. We observed the next higher mean values for A/A, A/B, and A/C haplotype combinations. Moreover, platelet reactivity in these groups did not change during treatment. Based on these results, we concluded that patients with B haplotype had numerically lower platelet reactivity on clopidogrel treatment at 6 months. Although, it should be emphasized that the observed differences were not statistically significant.

After studying the influence of the rs6801273 polymorphism and the established haplotypes on the phenotypes observed in patients, we noted that patients with the C allele of rs6801273 polymorphism (TC heterozygotes and CC homozygotes) were more likely to be classified as poor responders with HPR. This could potentially indicate reduced efficacy of clopidogrel therapy.

The analysis of the relationship between the H1 and H2 haplotypes and the phenotype observed in the patients showed that carriers of the H1/H2 combination are more likely to have HPR. However, the study group for H1/H2 carriers, regarding HPR and LPR phenotypes, were very small and thus difficult to compare with the H1/H1 carriers subgroup. Additionally, differences between H1/H1 and H1/H2 carriers were not statistically significant.

Regarding A, B, and C haplotypes, we could not fully investigate their impact on observed phenotypes because of very small study subgroups. The highest proportion of NPR phenotype after treatment was observed in patients with A/C, A/A, and A/B, but we could hardly compare them to B/B and B/C due to the too small number of subjects included.

The influence of P2Y_12_ receptor polymorphisms could also be multifactorial and a significant effect occurs only when several of them overlap [[29](#CIT00029),[30](#CIT00030)]. We investigated the impact of comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia), smoking habits, and statin intake on observed PRU values on the day of the procedure and after 6-month treatment. On the day of the procedure, H1/H1 obese carriers had lower PRU^0^ values. On the other hand, smoking and diabetic patients are predisposed to higher mean PRU values. For H1/H2 carriers, we observed contradictory results. Obese patients had higher mean platelet reactivity levels, while smoking or diabetic patients had lower PRU^0^ values. Nevertheless, the obtained results proved to be statistically insignificant (*p* > 0.05).

Shahim et al. [[31](#CIT00031)] found that high platelet reactivity was more common in patients with diabetes. Moreover, Jastrzebska et al. [[32](#CIT00032)] concluded that diabetes with coronary heart disease is related to poorer response to antiplatelet therapy, especially to clopidogrel treatment. When we compared PRU^6^, we observed that H1/H1 diabetic carriers had significantly higher mean platelet reactivity than subjects without diabetes. The same correlation was not observed for H1/H2 carriers. The influence of obesity and overweight was studied by Ranucci et al. [[33](#CIT00033)]. The authors found that the obese/overweight subjects had higher platelet reactivity. Our research revealed that obese subjects with an H1/H2 haplotype combination proved to have significantly lower PRU^6^ values – correlation not observed for H1/H1 patients. These results may suggest that for different haplotypes, different cofactors can influence antiplatelet therapy. Diabetes could possibly predispose to better response to treatment in H1/H1 carriers, while obesity may cause poorer therapy outcomes.

Siasos et al. [[6](#CIT00006)] and Nie et al. [[16](#CIT00016)] investigated the influence of smoking habits on the effectiveness of therapy. They assumed that compounds in tobacco smoke induce CYP1A2, thereby increasing the metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite, which may lead to lower PRU values after treatment with clopidogrel in H1/H2 patients. On the other hand, the same chemical compounds may cause an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, which explains the higher PRU values, they observed in the H1/H1 group. Our research revealed that PRU^6^ values for H1/H1 smoking carriers were higher while smoking in H1/H2 subjects could be associated with lower platelet reactivity. Despite observed differences, the smoking habit was not statistically significant. Although we found that rs6801273 TC smoking genotype carriers had significantly higher PRU^6^ values, in our analysis, we compared only one smoking patient with non-smokers which makes it impossible to draw any further conclusions (Supplementary Table S9).

Administration of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin and their possible interaction with clopidogrel should also be considered [[34](#CIT00034)]. We found statins' influence dependable on the kind of taken statin and observed haplotype. We found that H1/H1 haplotype carriers were more likely to have higher PRU^0^ and PRU^6^ values while taking atorvastatin compared with patients treated with rosuvastatin. For H1/H2 carriers, we observed contradictory results. Patients treated with atorvastatin had higher PRU^0^ and PRU^6^ values than subjects administrated with rosuvastatin, but in both instances, observed differences were not statistically significant.

The results of our work may be affected by the limitations of the carried-out research. First of all, the small number of the study group could prevent a population-wide view of the issue and could affect the results of statistical analysis. Such obstacles were related to, among other things, the lack of patients with rarer recessive homozygous genotypes in the case of T744C and G52T polymorphisms. This did not allow us to fully investigate the influence of T and C (T744C) and G and T (G52T) alleles. Meanwhile, according to available literature data, patients with the CC (T744C) and GG (G52T) genotypes are at the greatest risk of reduced effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy; other reports suggest that the results observed in these groups are clinically significant [[13](#CIT00013),[14](#CIT00014)]. Moreover, based on the lack of rarer alleles translated into distinguished A, B and C haplotypes, we could not fully investigate their influence. It translated to the limitations in evaluating the influence of studied comorbidities. After adjusting for A, B, and C haplotypes, it occurred that the studied groups were very small, which did not let us conduct further analysis. Additionally, we did not include the influence of CYP2C19, ABCB1 polymorphisms, and measurements of clopidogrel metabolites - factors which could potentially impact clopidogrel therapy outcome.

## 5. Conclusion

In summary, no statistically significant effect of the studied gene polymorphisms of the P2Y_12_ platelet receptor alone was observed in this work. However, we observed a statistically significant influence of diabetes and obesity on platelet reactivity observed in patients. Their impact depended on observed haplotypes and genotypes. However, one of the goals of genetic research is to assess the risk of pharmacotherapy impairment so that we can take the most individual approach to the patient and the problems they face. Owing to the obtained results, it will be possible to take a broader view of the complexity of such treatment and include another variable in the planning of pharmacotherapy. It should not be forgotten that there are a much larger number of possible polymorphisms for the P2Y_12_ platelet receptor gene, comorbidities, or drug interactions, the impact of which should be included, and further research about the subject is needed.
