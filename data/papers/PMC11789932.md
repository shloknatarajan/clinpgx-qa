## Abstract

5‐hydroxytryptamine‐3 (5‐HT3) receptor antagonists including ondansetron, tropisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, granisetron, and ramosetron are commonly used to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting. Most of these medications are at least partially metabolized via the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme, resulting in variations of metabolism among individuals. Current (2017) international prescribing guidelines for ondansetron/tropisetron use according to genotype provide recommendations for CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers but not intermediate or poor metabolizers. However, multiple studies have been conducted since this guideline was published. This review evaluated all available evidence of an association between CYP2D6 genotype and 5‐HT3 receptor antagonist outcomes, including in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate/poor metabolizers and pediatric‐specific studies. In this review, we confirm that CYP2D6 genotype impacts ondansetron response in a postoperative nausea and vomiting setting, which was supported by a meta‐analysis. We also highlight the heterogeneity and limitations of included studies as well as provide future directions for pharmacogenomics research.

Pharmacogenomics uses an individual's genetic information to guide medication prescribing. Variants in pharmacogenes can help explain variability in medication response between patients. Patients with the CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype have a decreased response to ondansetron and tropisetron, and there is an international recommendation to use an alternative agent in this group.

This review assessed all evidence to date for association between *CYP2D6* genotype and 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist outcomes. It included areas previously lacking in evidence, such as CYP2D6 intermediate and poor metabolizer phenotypes, as well as children.

This review has demonstrated that *CYP2D6* genotype impacts postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) outcomes. There is evidence that CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers experience more PONV after ondansetron than normal metabolizers, and that normal metabolizers experience more PONV after ondansetron than intermediate/poor metabolizers. We have highlighted the heterogeneity amongst studies describing the effect of *CYP2D6* genotype on 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist outcomes and the need for large, prospective, and well‐designed studies in this field.

The findings from this review suggest that pharmacogenomic testing prior to ondansetron use may be beneficial, particularly in a postoperative setting. They also give direction to future studies that may be conducted. Careful consideration needs to be given to the impact of phenoconversion and alternative pathways for metabolism in pharmacogenomic studies.

## INTRODUCTION

Nausea and vomiting are common adverse effects of many chemotherapeutic agents and can significantly impact the well‐being of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.[1](#cts70108-bib-0001) In addition, cancer treatment requires procedures (e.g., central line insertion) that necessitate general anesthetic or sedation, and many postoperative patients experience distress secondary to nausea and vomiting.[2](#cts70108-bib-0002) The use of 5‐hydroxytryptamine‐3 (5‐HT_3_) receptor antagonists in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting has markedly improved clinical care and these medications are now widely accepted first‐line agents.[1](#cts70108-bib-0001), [2](#cts70108-bib-0002), [3](#cts70108-bib-0003), [4](#cts70108-bib-0004) The 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists include ondansetron, tropisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, granisetron, and ramosetron.[2](#cts70108-bib-0002), [5](#cts70108-bib-0005)

There are distinct differences between the pharmacokinetic profiles of the 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [7](#cts70108-bib-0007), [8](#cts70108-bib-0008) All 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists undergo metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and are converted to less active metabolites.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [9](#cts70108-bib-0009), [10](#cts70108-bib-0010) However, there are differences in the specific CYP subtype involved, as well as the number and extent of pathways.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [11](#cts70108-bib-0011) Ondansetron, tropisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and ramosetron are all at least partially metabolized by CYP2D6.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) Approximately 30% of ondansetron metabolism occurs via CYP2D6, with additional metabolism via CYP3A, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [12](#cts70108-bib-0012) More than 90% of both dolasetron and tropisetron are metabolized via CYP2D6, with minor involvement from CYP3A.[5](#cts70108-bib-0005), [6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [12](#cts70108-bib-0012) Ramosetron metabolism involves CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6, whereas palonosetron is largely metabolized via CYP2D6, with some involvement from CYP1A2 and CYP3A.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) Granisetron is not metabolized by CYP2D6 and is instead primarily metabolized via CYP1A1 and CYP3A4.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006)

The CYP2D6 enzyme is encoded by the *CYP2D6* gene, which is highly polymorphic and subject to single‐nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, and structural variants including gene deletions, duplications, and fusions.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [11](#cts70108-bib-0011), [13](#cts70108-bib-0013) Such variations in the gene can result in functional changes impacting enzyme activity and there is a resulting continuum of enzyme activity documented amongst individuals.[13](#cts70108-bib-0013) Therefore, medications that are reliant on CYP2D6 for their metabolism (such as 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists) differ in their efficacy according to the patient's CYP2D6 activity and corresponding phenotype (or metabolizer state). Genetic testing for *CYP2D6* variants and copy number variations can help predict phenotype and inform medication prescribing.[14](#cts70108-bib-0014) This approach to using an individual's genes to guide medicine use is known as pharmacogenetics or pharmacogenomics.

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)[14](#cts70108-bib-0014) creates evidence‐based clinical practice guidelines for prescribing medications according to pharmacogenetic test results. The latest CPIC guideline for ondansetron and tropisetron use according to *CYP2D6* genotype was published in 2017.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) However, at that point translation of *CYP2D6* genotype to phenotype among clinical laboratories and clinical practice guidelines was inconsistent.[15](#cts70108-bib-0015) In 2020, consensus recommendations for standardizing *CYP2D6* genotype to phenotype translation were published by CPIC and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG).[15](#cts70108-bib-0015) Star allele nomenclature is used to describe haplotypes and each allele is assigned to a functional group with an activity value (AV): normal function (e.g., *1, AV 1), decreased function (e.g., *10, AV 0.25; *17, AV 0.5) and no function (e.g., *4, AV 0).[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) A diplotype is a combination of two alleles and the AVs are added together to calculate the total activity score (AS), which is then translated into a predicted phenotype.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) *CYP2D6* is also subject to copy number variation that can lead ASs greater than 2 and increased CYP2D6 activity. The CYP2D6 phenotypes are ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs; AS >2.25), normal metabolizers (NMs; AS 1.25 to ≤2.25), intermediate metabolizers (IMs; AS >0 to <1.25), and poor metabolizers (PMs; AS 0).[15](#cts70108-bib-0015)

The 2017 CPIC ondansetron/tropisetron guideline appraised available studies and established a body of evidence indicating that patients with increased CYP2D6 activity (i.e., ultrarapid metabolizers) have an increased risk of ondansetron failure (i.e., more nausea and vomiting occurs).[6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [11](#cts70108-bib-0011), [16](#cts70108-bib-0016) Therefore, in patients with a known CYP2D6 status, a recommendation to select an alternative drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 (i.e., granisetron) in UM patients prescribed ondansetron or tropisetron was made.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) The strength of this recommendation according to CPIC classification was “Moderate,” considering the available evidence and existing suitable alternative antiemetics (i.e., granisetron).[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) There was not enough evidence available to make a recommendation for IM or PM groups.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006)

CYP2D6 phenotype frequencies vary among populations, although UM and PM groups usually account for a minority.[17](#cts70108-bib-0017) It is estimated that CYP2D6 PM make up between 0.4% and 6.5% of individuals and ultrarapid metabolizers 1%–2%.[17](#cts70108-bib-0017) However, some studies have reported UM frequencies of up to 10% in Caucasians and 28% of North Africans.[17](#cts70108-bib-0017) The low proportions of these phenotypes in many of the studies to date presents difficulties in accurately assessing effect size between phenotype groups.

In a rapidly evolving field such as pharmacogenomics, it is important to periodically re‐evaluate evidence to inform prescribing recommendations. The current CPIC ondansetron/tropisetron guideline is now 7 years old. Therefore, this systematic review aims to appraise all available literature reporting on 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist outcomes according to *CYP2D6* genotype, including in pediatric‐specific cohorts where data has previously been lacking.

## METHODS

This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023478806) and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) statement.[18](#cts70108-bib-0018)

### Search strategy

The literature search was performed on October 26, 2023 in three biomedical databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE. Keywords were searched in all fields using the following query: “(p4502d6 or 2d6 or cyp2d6) and (ondansetron or tropisetron or palonosetron or granisetron or dolasetron or ramosetron or 5‐HT3 or 5HT3)” (“.af” was added for searches in MEDLINE). No year, language, or other filters were used. The search was repeated on August 22, 2024, to confirm that no new articles were published after the initial search. The review was inclusive of all study designs.

### Data screening and extraction

Following the search, all retrieved records were imported into the Catchii systematic review management tool for subsequent screening and data extraction processes.[19](#cts70108-bib-0019) Initially, Catchii's duplicate detection feature was used to identify and eliminate duplicate records across the datasets. Subsequently, the remaining records were subjected to a two‐stage screening process. In the first phase, four reviewers independently conducted blind screenings of titles and abstracts against the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included studies reporting *CYP2D6* genotype to phenotype correlations, enzyme activity to phenotype relationships, and the impact of CYP2D6 genotyping/phenotyping on the metabolism, toxicity, or clinical efficacy of ondansetron, tropisetron, ramosetron, palonosetron, dolasetron or granisetron. Exclusions were made for non‐human studies, conference abstracts, review articles, guidelines, commentaries, and editorials.

In the second phase, full text of articles that passed the first screening was examined by two reviewers. Any discrepancies at both stages were resolved through discussions until a consensus was reached. The data extraction phase involved three reviewers, where each article was reviewed by two of them: one initially extracted information from the selected articles into Catchii and another reviewer verified and updated if necessary. The following information was collected, the type of study, pharmacokinetic (pK) parameters, population, sample size, ethnicity, cohort (adult/pediatrics), alleles tested for and identified, study outcomes, genotyping method, phenotyping assessment method, and route administered.

### Genotype‐inferred phenotype assignment

*CYP2D6* genotype‐inferred phenotypes were assigned according to the authors of individual studies. As most studies were conducted prior to 2020, there were a number of inconsistencies with the CPIC/DPWG CYP2D6 consensus recommendations.[15](#cts70108-bib-0015) These are noted in the results table.

### Statistical methods and meta‐analyses

All analyses were conducted via Stata 18.[20](#cts70108-bib-0020) Genotypes and outcomes were classified as binary variables; UM vs. NM and NMvs IM/PM, in separate analyses. A fixed‐effect model was used as the effect of the genotype on the outcome was not expected to be modified by the relatively homogeneous settings of the studies. The Mantel–Haenszel method was used. Heterogeneity was not planned to be assessed due to the use of the fixed model. *p*‐values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Quality and risk of bias

The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach[21](#cts70108-bib-0021) was utilized to evaluate the degree of limitation of each study included in this systematic review and rate the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.

Risk of bias was assessed for each study across three outcome categories: pharmacokinetic studies, toxicities (assessing cardiac function including QT prolongation due to 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists), and efficacy in nausea and vomiting (postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) or chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)). This assessment aimed to measure the confidence in the results across each outcome. For studies that addressed multiple outcomes, the risk of bias was assessed separately for each outcome. To minimize assessment bias, three independent reviewers were involved in the evaluation process and assessed each study for limitations including methods disclosure, allocation concealment, outcome measurement, blinding, appropriate differentiation of metabolizer groups, and control of confounding factors. After identifying and analyzing limitations, a final assessment of the risk of bias was determined for each study as high, low, or unclear. Any discrepancies among the reviewers were discussed until a consensus was reached. A low risk of bias indicates that the study is minimally influenced by bias, while a high risk of bias suggests significant influence, potentially impacting result interpretation.

Table [S1](#cts70108-supitem-0001) outlines our approach to evaluating study limitations. The risk of bias was marked as unclear when the limitation suggested a plausible bias that raises doubts about the results. Reasons included providing an unclear explanation of the methodology used, flawed measurement of exposure or failure to adequately control for confounders, for example, when concomitant medications were not mentioned. The risk of bias was assigned as high when the potential limitation was likely to lower confidence in the estimate of effect. This was true when the study failed to adequately control confounders: concomitant medications were documented but effects were not accounted for, there were unclear or poorly differentiated metabolizer groups, or lack of blinding.

Study outcomes were then aggregated and the body of evidence for each outcome was assigned an overall evidence grade. Evidence grades are reflective of confidence that an estimate of the effect is correct.[21](#cts70108-bib-0021) Grading was designated as very low, low, moderate, or high according to the GRADE framework.[21](#cts70108-bib-0021) Initial evidence grades were assigned according to study design and could be graded up or down according to eight factors.[21](#cts70108-bib-0021)

## RESULTS

### Studies identified

A total of 258 records were initially identified from the literature databases. After removing duplicates (*n* = 149), 109 articles underwent abstract and title screening, followed by full‐text assessment of 47 articles. One article was not able to be retrieved for full‐text screening. A total of 27 articles were excluded as they did not meet full eligibility criteria, leaving 20 studies. Refer to Figure [1](#cts70108-fig-0001) for the PRISMA flowchart with exclusion reasons provided.

PRISMA flowchart.

The 20 studies identified (Table [1](#cts70108-tbl-0001)) were largely heterogenous with respect to population, investigated drug, dose and route given, specific outcome measures, and findings. Eight studies reported on pharmacokinetic parameters of a 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist, four reported on the association with adverse effects (three specifically measured ECG changes), and 11 reported on efficacy (nausea and/or vomiting outcomes). Due to differences in outcome measure reporting, a meta‐analysis was only able to be undertaken for PONV response and included three studies.

### Risk of bias assessment

Table [2](#cts70108-tbl-0002) illustrates the risk of bias assessment. Of note, a common issue encountered was the failure of studies to document the presence or absence of concomitant medications, which could potentially influence the outcomes independently of the genetic factors under investigation. Where this occurred, the risk of bias was adjusted from low risk to unclear risk.

### Review summary

#### Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)

Five articles examined the association between *CYP2D6* genotype and PONV outcomes after ondansetron administration and four of these concluded that PONV outcomes were affected by *CYP2D6* genotype (Table [3](#cts70108-tbl-0003)). Niewinski et al. found that CYP2D6 UMs experienced more PONV after ondansetron administration,[22](#cts70108-bib-0022) as did a case study by McFadgen et al.,[23](#cts70108-bib-0023) although both of these studies were considered low‐quality evidence due to study design. Interestingly, Candiotti et al.[11](#cts70108-bib-0011) found that UMs experienced more vomiting, but not nausea, after ondansetron administration. It was also demonstrated that IMs and PMs experienced less PONV than NMs.[22](#cts70108-bib-0022) While not able to be directly compared with other studies, Ribeiro et al.[24](#cts70108-bib-0024) concluded that the AA genotype of rs16947:G>A (one of *2 core variants) and AA of rs1065852:G>A (one of *10 core variants, associated with decreased function) may affect ondansetron efficacy. The only study that did not find an association between *CYP2D6* genotype and PONV outcomes was a pediatric study.[25](#cts70108-bib-0025) However, this study provided very low‐quality evidence when assessed using the GRADE approach due to major study design flaws.

| Outcome | Study | Specific outcome measure | Quality of evidence according to GRADE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CYP2D6 UMs experienced more PONV after ondansetron | Niewinski McFadgen (case study) | PONV occurrence rates within 5 h | Low |
| CYP2D6 IM and PMs experienced less PONV than NMs after ondansetron | Niewinski | PONV occurrence rates within 5 h | Low |
| CYP2D6 UMs experience more postoperative vomiting after ondansetron | Candiotti | PONV occurrence rates within 4 h | Low |
| CYP2D6 UMs experienced more postoperative vomiting after dolasetron compared with granisetron | Janicki | PONV occurrence in 24 h | High |

Table Caption: PONV outcomes with 5‐HT3 receptor antagonists.

Two studies assessed as high‐quality,[24](#cts70108-bib-0024), [26](#cts70108-bib-0026) reported on 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists other than ondansetron (Table [3](#cts70108-tbl-0003)), and both found an association with PONV outcomes and *CYP2D6* genotype.[24](#cts70108-bib-0024), [26](#cts70108-bib-0026) Further, CYP2D6 UM patients experienced more postoperative vomiting after dolasetron administration, compared with granisetron.[26](#cts70108-bib-0026) As dolasetron is known to be at least partly metabolized through the CYP2D6 pathway, and granisetron is not, this finding suggests inefficacy of dolasetron in UM patients.[26](#cts70108-bib-0026) Additionally, Ribeiro et al.[24](#cts70108-bib-0024) also investigated palonosetron for PONV and concluded that SNP GG rs16947:G>A may affect the PONV efficacy of palonosetron.

#### Meta‐analysis of PONV outcomes

We undertook a meta‐analysis of three studies (*n* = 958 patients) that compared PONV amongst patients with different CYP2D6 metabolizer states given ondansetron (Black, Niewinski and Candiotti, Table [4](#cts70108-tbl-0004)). The case study by McFadgen et al. was excluded from the meta‐analysis as case studies are considered very low‐quality evidence. Additionally, the study by Janicki et al. was excluded as it focussed only on dolasetron and granisetron, and Ribeiro et al. were excluded because outcomes were reported based on haplotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rather than diplotype star alleles. All studies included in the meta‐analysis classified phenotype groups according to the *CYP2D6* genotype to phenotype translation consensus.[15](#cts70108-bib-0015)

| Outcome | Number of participants (studies) | Quality of evidence | Relative effect Risk Ratio (95% CI) | Absolute risk difference (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Greater incidence of PONV in NM compared with IM/PM | 937/958 (3 studies) | LOW | RR 1.08 (1.02–1.16) | 9.6 |
| Greater incidence of PONV in UM compared with NM | 610/958 (3 studies) | LOW | RR 1.18 (0.66–2.1) | 8.2 |

Table Caption: Summary of findings table for meta‐analysis of PONV after ondansetron use in patients with different metabolizer states.

Pooled meta‐analysis demonstrated that patients classified as NM experienced significantly more PONV than IM and PM patients following ondansetron administration (RR: 1.08 [95% CI: 1.02–1.16]; *p* = 0.01) using a fixed‐effect model. However, there was a large degree of heterogeneity observed (61.87%) that may be consistent with a degree of moderate heterogeneity in the effect between trials (Figure [2](#cts70108-fig-0002)). This is not consistent with the likely biological mechanism of genotype influence on medication metabolism as the three trials have relatively similar situations. Further, the confidence intervals for all estimates of risk ratio overlap and the direction of the effect is consistent. Therefore, we continued with the fixed‐effect model for this analysis.

The same three studies were used to evaluate PONV outcomes in UM compared with NM. While there was a positive trend, there was no significant difference between groups (RR: 1.18 [95% CI: 0.66–2.10]; *p* = 0.570) (Figure [3](#cts70108-fig-0003)).

#### Chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)

CINV outcome measures and findings varied widely between studies of ondansetron use in different *CYP2D6* genotypes (Table [S2](#cts70108-supitem-0001)). All four studies (Kaiser et al., Edwards et al., Perwitasari et al. and Jacobs et al.) used a different specific measure of ondansetron efficacy.[3](#cts70108-bib-0003), [16](#cts70108-bib-0016), [27](#cts70108-bib-0027), [28](#cts70108-bib-0028) Two studies demonstrated a higher incidence of CINV in UMs after ondansetron administration, although this was assessed as low‐quality evidence due to study design.[16](#cts70108-bib-0016), [27](#cts70108-bib-0027) Additionally, Kaiser et al.[16](#cts70108-bib-0016) reported less CINV in PMs. Conversely, two studies independently concluded CYP2D6 metabolizer state does not predict ondansetron failure, although this outcome was assessed as very low quality due to study design and low numbers of PM/UM participants.[3](#cts70108-bib-0003), [28](#cts70108-bib-0028) Two of these studies included pediatric patients—Edwards et al. and Jacobs et al.[3](#cts70108-bib-0003), [27](#cts70108-bib-0027)

There were limited studies evaluating genotype‐associated CINV outcomes with non‐ondansetron 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists (Table [S2](#cts70108-supitem-0001)). Kaiser et al. evaluated CINV outcomes following tropisetron administration and reported higher incidence and severity of CINV (low‐quality evidence due to study design). *CYP2D6* variation did not affect the variability of ramosetron in the study by Kang et al.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Three studies (Rauers et al., Stamer et al., and Ashforth et al.) reported the impact of *CYP2D6* variation on ondansetron pharmacokinetics. Stamer et al. found that S‐ondansetron levels correlated with CYP2D6 metabolizer status and differed according to activity scores.[29](#cts70108-bib-0029) Less effect was observed when the S‐(+)enantiomer was not isolated. Plasma concentrations of ondansetron did not differ between different metabolizer states in the study by Rauers et al.[30](#cts70108-bib-0030) The Ashforth et al.[10](#cts70108-bib-0010) study also found no difference in ondansetron pK parameters between PM and NM groups but used the probe drug debrisoquine to predict CYP2D6 phenotype rather than genotyping. All evidence was assessed as low quality due to study design, except Stamer et al., which was assessed as moderate.

All other studies that reported on non‐ondansetron 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist pK parameters in different metabolizer groups largely demonstrated an effect of *CYP2D6* genotype on drug pK. Kaiser et al. and Kim et al. both showed differences in tropisetron pK between different metabolizer state groups.[16](#cts70108-bib-0016), [31](#cts70108-bib-0031), [32](#cts70108-bib-0032) Similarly, greater exposure to hydrodolasetron was observed in PMs compared with NMs.[5](#cts70108-bib-0005), [9](#cts70108-bib-0009) It should be noted that the phenotype assignment used by Li et al. in their analysis differed from that used by CPIC in that IM participants (according to CPIC/DPWG) were assigned PM status in the paper. Phenotype assignment was also unclear in the Kadokura et al. where no association between CYP2D6 metabolizer state and ramosetron pK was found.[33](#cts70108-bib-0033)

#### Toxicity and adverse effects

Four articles (Adams et al., Li et al., Drogemoller et al., Wong et al.) investigated the effect of *CYP2D6* genotype on the incidence of adverse effects of a 5‐HT_3_ antagonist.[5](#cts70108-bib-0005), [9](#cts70108-bib-0009), [34](#cts70108-bib-0034), [35](#cts70108-bib-0035) Only the case study by Wong et al. found an association between genotype (the *41 allele) and increased risk of an adverse effect (dystonic reactions) when given ondansetron.[35](#cts70108-bib-0035) The other three studies focussed specifically on ECG changes and did not find a substantive association.[5](#cts70108-bib-0005), [9](#cts70108-bib-0009), [34](#cts70108-bib-0034) Li et al. identified some QT changes after dolasetron administration in PM, however, they were not deemed clinically meaningful and were not assessed using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).[5](#cts70108-bib-0005), [36](#cts70108-bib-0036)

#### Pediatric patients

Four studies included pediatric patients (Edwards et al., Jacobs et al., Black et al. and Drogemoller et al.).[3](#cts70108-bib-0003), [25](#cts70108-bib-0025), [27](#cts70108-bib-0027), [34](#cts70108-bib-0034) One study found that UMs experienced more vomiting when taking ondansetron for CINV; however, the study was a retrospective chart review and included low numbers of UM participants (*n* = 3).[27](#cts70108-bib-0027) A second study concluded metabolizer state did not predict ondansetron failure when used for CINV but again had low numbers of UM participants and multiple confounders (e.g., study participants had different cancer diagnoses and received a diverse range of cancer regimens, of varying emetogenicity).[3](#cts70108-bib-0003) The third study by Black et al.[25](#cts70108-bib-0025) also found no association between metabolizer state and ondansetron PONV outcomes. Finally, Drogemoller et al.[34](#cts70108-bib-0034) demonstrated a lack of association between CYP2D6 activity score and ondansetron QTc prolongation.

## DISCUSSION

This review aimed to evaluate the evidence of association between *CYP2D6* genotype and 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist response. The current CPIC guideline for tropisetron/ondansetron prescribing according to known *CYP2D6* genotype was published in 2017 and only included recommendations for UM patients prescribed ondansetron/tropisetron.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) We hoped this review would provide an update to the evidence from 2017.

### PONV

Currently, there is evidence to suggest that ondansetron efficacy is affected by *CYP2D6* genotype in the PONV setting (albeit low quality if assessed using the GRADE approach). Studies have demonstrated that UMs experience more PONV than NMs,[11](#cts70108-bib-0011), [22](#cts70108-bib-0022) and IM/PMs experience less PONV than NMs.[22](#cts70108-bib-0022) Results from our meta‐analysis validated the difference in PONV between IM/PM and NM, however, the difference between UM and NM was not found to be statistically significant. Nonetheless, the evidence identified in this review is considered sufficient to support current CPIC prescribing guidelines for ondansetron/tropisetron in UM patients. Additional prescribing guidelines are unlikely to be made as a result of this meta‐analysis, although it can be used to further advocate for pharmacogenetic testing with ondansetron.

The unexpected non‐significant difference between UM and IM/PM groups for PONV outcomes was largely due to the negative findings of the Black et al.[25](#cts70108-bib-0025) study. While this was a sufficiently powered study (*n* = 652), outcomes were recorded via a retrospective chart review and there were still only a small number of UM individuals (1.4%),[25](#cts70108-bib-0025) which may contribute to bias in the findings. Interestingly, it was the only pediatric PONV study identified, suggesting a possibility that the impact of *CYP2D6* genotype on ondansetron PONV outcomes differs between adults and children. The limited data support an association between *CYP2D6* genotype and dolasetron and ramosetron response.

### CINV

The data supporting an association between *CYP2D6* genotype association and 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist CINV outcomes are inconsistent. This may arise from differences in the study cohorts and the existence of more patient variables in oncology (for example, cancer diagnosis, type and cumulative doses of chemotherapy administered, comorbidities, and concurrent medications that impact CYP enzymes). While some of the mechanisms of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative setting are the same as those in CINV, antiemetics that are effective in CINV are not always beneficial in PONV.[37](#cts70108-bib-0037) Therefore, different etiologies of nausea and vomiting may need to be differentiated with respect to genotype guided prescribing recommendations for ondansetron. Limited data support an association between *CYP2D6* genotype and tropisetron response, but not ramosetron.

### Pharmacokinetics

Findings from this review suggest that the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, currently marketed as a racemic mixture of R‐(−) and S‐(+) enantiomers, is not significantly impacted by *CYP2D6* genotype.[10](#cts70108-bib-0010), [30](#cts70108-bib-0030), [38](#cts70108-bib-0038), [39](#cts70108-bib-0039) However, the study by Ashforth et al. did not include any UM participants and Rauers et al. included only two UMs.[10](#cts70108-bib-0010), [30](#cts70108-bib-0030) Interestingly, Stamer et al.[29](#cts70108-bib-0029) demonstrated that the AUC of S‐ondansetron was influenced by *CYP2D6* genotype. R‐ondansetron has been proposed to have a better safety profile and be more effective than S‐ondansetron.[38](#cts70108-bib-0038) This may be in part due to its metabolic pathway, which is independent of the highly polymorphic CYP2D6.[29](#cts70108-bib-0029) If validated in larger studies, there are potential implications for future drug development. In contrast, concentrations of hydrodolasetron and tropisetron were found to vary according to *CYP2D6* genotype.[9](#cts70108-bib-0009), [16](#cts70108-bib-0016), [32](#cts70108-bib-0032) This is perhaps unsurprising given that tropisetron and dolasetron are known to be metabolized almost entirely by CYP2D6.[9](#cts70108-bib-0009), [16](#cts70108-bib-0016), [32](#cts70108-bib-0032)

### Toxicity

5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists are known to be generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse effects are reported as mild and include headache, constipation, and elevated liver enzymes.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) It is therefore expected that few studies focus on the impact of *CYP2D6* genotype on 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist adverse effects. The most significant safety concern with respect to ondansetron and other 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists is their association with cardiac arrythmias.[7](#cts70108-bib-0007) The results from this review suggest that this adverse effect may not be related to CYP2D6 metabolizer state. While Li et al. detected a decrease in QTc interval in PM patients 8 h after dolasetron administration (compared with baseline), the authors deemed the result “not clinically meaningful” and there were low numbers of PM participants (*n* = 6).[5](#cts70108-bib-0005) However, more studies are needed to confirm a lack of association between *CYP2D6* genotype and 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist‐induced arrythmias. It is particularly important to investigate high‐risk cohorts, such as oncology patients, in whom QTc prolongation is more prevalent[40](#cts70108-bib-0040) due to polypharmacy and increased likelihood of electrolyte abnormalities. While Drogemoller et al.[34](#cts70108-bib-0034) included a subset of oncology patients, a genotype‐QTc association may have been mitigated by the age of the patients. A recent systematic review by Singh et al.[41](#cts70108-bib-0041) found that ondansetron‐induced QT prolongation was only statistically significant in adults. Despite this, 20% of the pediatric oncology patients in the Drogemoller et al.[34](#cts70108-bib-0034) study did experience QTc prolongation but did not meet the study criteria of “unsafe QT prolongation” (increase in QTc interval greater than 60 ms from baseline or a QTc interval greater than 500 ms). There were several other findings that while not statistically significant, were of clinical interest. From the three patients who showed “Unsafe QTc prolongation,” two had reduced CYP2D6 activity scores (AS = 0.5).[34](#cts70108-bib-0034)

### Pediatric‐specific studies

There were no definitive, pediatric‐specific results that emerged from this review. There were only three studies assessing ondansetron response that included pediatric patients, and the results were mixed (Edwards et al., Jacobs et al. and Black et al.).[3](#cts70108-bib-0003), [25](#cts70108-bib-0025), [27](#cts70108-bib-0027) Black et al. reported PONV outcomes, whereas Jacobs et al. and Edwards et al. reported CINV outcomes. Only Edwards et al. demonstrated an association between *CYP2D6* genotype and ondansetron response. The current CPIC guideline for ondansetron and tropisetron contains the following caveat: “At the time of this writing, there are no data available on *CYP2D6* genotype's effect on ondansetron or tropisetron response in the pediatric patient populations, although there is no reason to suspect that *CYP2D6* genetic variation will affect this drug's metabolism differently in children compared with adults.”[6](#cts70108-bib-0006) However, it is important to confirm through larger studies whether there are, in fact, differences between pediatric and adult patients. If differences exist, the underlying mechanism must be identified so that the use of these antiemetics can be personalized for children as well as adults. Black et al. suggested that ontogeny of enzymes other than CYP2D6 (e.g., CYP3A and CYP1A) and 5‐HT_3_ drug transporters may explain some of the age‐based variability,[25](#cts70108-bib-0025) but this needs to be further investigated.

### Limitations

Once stratified according to outcome (e.g., CINV, PONV), few studies were available to include in the overall analysis and meta‐analysis. Between studies, there was a significant degree of heterogeneity, which may confound direct comparison of effect measurement. Studies varied according to population, age of patients, drugs used, drug dose, drug route, and specific outcome measures. We also included studies that reported the association between *CYP2D6* genotype and 5‐HT_3_ antagonist response as secondary outcomes,[5](#cts70108-bib-0005), [9](#cts70108-bib-0009) which meant data were often missing, difficult to interpret, or subject to more confounders.[5](#cts70108-bib-0005), [9](#cts70108-bib-0009)

We chose to assess the quality of review studies using the GRADE approach, as it is now considered a best‐practice framework by many internationally recognized organizations.[42](#cts70108-bib-0042) However, the challenges of applying the GRADE approach to nonrandomized studies have been previously documented.[43](#cts70108-bib-0043) This was the case in our review, where most of the studies were observational in nature and thus were graded as low quality using the GRADE approach. Incorporating randomization into studies could improve the evidence quality according to this method, however, this is not always feasible. Alternatively, performing a meta‐analysis on an adequate number of well‐designed prospective cohort studies would also give more weight to findings, providing specific outcome measures allowed for this.

There were several limitations of the studies themselves that should be used to inform future study design in this field. The relatively low frequencies of CYP2D6 UM and PM in most populations, and in the studies in this review, make it difficult to accurately assess effect size between phenotype groups. Further studies correlating *CYP2D6* genotype, and 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists outcomes need to be undertaken to aggregate enough data for minority genotypes. Additionally, pharmacogenetic studies must be conducted using participants of varying ancestries to ensure prescribing recommendations are representative of diverse populations. Study participants included in this review were vastly reported to be “Caucasian” or “European,” with only a small number of studies focussing on non‐European ancestry groups (i.e., Indonesian and Korean). This is indicative of broader pharmacogenomics literature, where ancestry diversity remains limited, and less than 20% of genome wide association studies include participants of non‐European ancestry, despite clear benefits of an inclusive approach.[44](#cts70108-bib-0044) Efforts must be made to address this gap to improve the accuracy and equity of pharmacogenomics.

Some studies did not perform extensive *CYP2D6* genotyping. By restricting the number of alleles tested in a population, there is the possibility that a variant outside what has been tested will incorrectly be assigned a “wild‐type” (*CYP2D6*1*) allele. This has implications for the accuracy of predicting phenotype. Consensus recommendations by the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), College of American Pathologists, Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group of the Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association, and the European Society for Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Therapy include a minimal set of variants to be tested for when genotyping *CYP2D6*.[45](#cts70108-bib-0045) For consistency and to determine the majority of alleles with functional changes across populations, studies should include all AMP Tier 1[45](#cts70108-bib-0045) CYP2D6 star alleles (those with population frequencies ≥1%), along with other ones that may be significant within the specific study population. The use of genome sequencing technologies or PGx‐specialized arrays, which offer broad coverage of known variants, are recommended for more accurate star allele assignment.

There were inconsistencies among studies as to how metabolizer states were defined by genotype. This was largely due to discrepancies in activity scores (or equivalent method) assigned to alleles and was more prevalent in papers written prior to the CPIC/DPWG consensus recommendations for standardizing *CYP2D6* genotype to phenotype translation in 2020.[15](#cts70108-bib-0015) It was not always possible to identify specific outcomes of individual patients who had been classified outside CPIC/DPWG recommendations.

While most of the evidence identified in this review was based on intravenous dosing of ondansetron, oral, mixed, and unspecified routes of administration were also included. CYP2D6‐associated ondansetron outcomes did not seem to be affected by route of administration. When ondansetron is administered orally, its bioavailability is approximately 60% due to first‐pass metabolism.[12](#cts70108-bib-0012) In theory, differences in ondansetron efficacy between CYP2D6 phenotype groups may be more pronounced when ondansetron is given orally, due to the increased exposure to hepatic enzymes. However, it has been suggested that pharmacodynamic factors, rather than plasma concentrations are more likely to influence ondansetron efficacy.[12](#cts70108-bib-0012) Future studies should look to investigate whether pharmacogenomic recommendations should differ according to the route of administration, for ondansetron and more broadly.

Surprisingly, many of the studies did not account for the effects of phenoconversion on patient outcomes. Phenoconversion is a phenomenon where the observed pharmacogene phenotype is different from the predicted genotype‐inferred phenotype.[46](#cts70108-bib-0046) The most studied example of CYP2D6 phenoconversion is taking concomitant medications, such as CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers.[46](#cts70108-bib-0046) In the presence of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, a patient may then phenoconvert from an NM to a PM.[46](#cts70108-bib-0046) Thus, to measure the true effect of 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist patient outcomes associated with *CYP2D6* genotype, studies should exclude medications with the potential to phenoconvert, for example, bupropion which is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor.[46](#cts70108-bib-0046) It has previously been suggested that phenoconversion could explain inconsistencies amongst pharmacogenetic studies and this may well be the case in this review.[47](#cts70108-bib-0047)

Metabolism of a given medication is not always limited to a single CYP enzyme pathway. Most of the included studies solely genotyped *CYP2D6* despite metabolism occurring via multiple CYP pathways, such as CYP3A or CYP1A2.[6](#cts70108-bib-0006), [12](#cts70108-bib-0012) We need further studies on genetic variants coding for alternate CYP enzymes and their impact on 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist response, and a comprehensive prediction of overall metabolism may need to be polygenic.

Alternate pathways for ondansetron metabolism may be utilized in CYP2D6 IM and PMs to compensate for the lack of CYP2D6 enzyme.[12](#cts70108-bib-0012) This rationale has been used to explain the minimal impact of CYP2D6 IM and PM status on response to ondansetron observed in some studies.[10](#cts70108-bib-0010), [11](#cts70108-bib-0011) However, our meta‐analysis demonstrated that there was in fact an effect difference when comparing IM/PM to NM, meaning we have not fully characterized the effect of *CYP2D6* genotypes on ondansetron metabolism.

The extensive limitations described, in both this review and the individual studies, underpin a major finding of this review: there is a lack of consistency and uniformity amongst pharmacogenomic studies that makes clinical appraisal difficult. These limitations led us to develop recommendations for future pharmacogenomic studies reporting in this field (Table [5](#cts70108-tbl-0005)). However, these challenges and limitations are not specific to *CYP2D6*/5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist studies.[48](#cts70108-bib-0048), [49](#cts70108-bib-0049) Therefore, these recommendations have broader application and should be considered when designing future pharmacogenomic studies.

### TABLE 5.

| Study limitation | Recommendation for future studies |
| --- | --- |
| Study designs were heterogeneous, with some design flaws and unclear methodologies | Studies should be well‐designed, prospective, and include a clear methodology |
| Inadequately powered | Include enough participants to adequately power the study |
| Studies largely included “Caucasian” or “European” participants | Inclusion of participants of diverse ancestries as well as focus on less studied populations for inclusion of minor genotype/phenotypes |
| Heterogenous medication administration details are sometimes unclear or unspecified | Drug administration details should be clearly specified (dose, route, frequency) |
| Limited genotype testing in some studies meant a lack of characterization of additional genotypes | A standardized approach to allele testing should be used – AMP Tier 1 45 recommendations in addition to others considered significant to the population |
| Unclear, inconsistent phenotype assignment | CPIC/DPWG 15 recommendations for translating genotype to phenotype should be used |
| Phenoconversion is not accounted for, which may confound results | Phenoconverting medications should be an exclusion criterion or accounted for in statistical analysis |
| Drug interactions and comorbidities may affect outcomes | Concomitant medications and comorbidities should be acknowledged |
| Studies do not account for alternate metabolism pathways | Where possible, studies should perform pharmacogenomic testing for all genes involved in the metabolism of a medication |
| Specific outcome measures differed between studies | Studies should use validated tools to measure nausea and vomiting (i.e., the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool in children) 50 |

### Future directions

Accurate characterization of the association between *CYP2D6* genotype and 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist response is needed to guide clinical usage. First and foremost, studies should be prospective and of sufficient numbers to account for minor allele frequencies. This will ensure there are enough UM and PM participants to determine the effect of these phenotypes on 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist outcomes. Standardized phenotype assignment according to the CPIC recommendations should be mandated for consistency. Wherever possible pediatric‐specific studies should be designed, to definitively establish whether current adult guidelines for 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists also apply to children. This will allay concerns about ontogeny.

Currently, most studies have focussed on ondansetron, but as the uptake of newer agents such as palonosetron increases, it will be important to develop PGx prescribing recommendations for these drugs. Therefore, our findings underscore the need for more evidence for non‐ondansetron 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonists. Finally, the role of phenoconversion and minor pathways in 5‐HT_3_ antagonist metabolism and subsequent impact on response must be further investigated and incorporated into future studies.

## CONCLUSION

More research is needed to fully elucidate the relationship between *CYP2D6* genotype and 5‐HT_3_ receptor antagonist response, with a focus on including a broad diversity of patient cohorts. The large degree of study design heterogeneity amongst the manuscripts included in this review limited data aggregation. Nevertheless, most studies agreed that *CYP2D6* genotype impacted ondansetron PONV outcomes and this was the only meta‐analysis that was able to be performed. A meta‐analysis of three studies demonstrated significance when comparing PONV outcomes in IM/PM with NM. PONV outcomes in UM compared with NM were not statistically different. Interestingly, results from ondansetron response in CINV studies were conflicting, probably due to the complexity of the patient cohort. We did not find an association between *CYP2D6* genotype and racemic ondansetron pharmacokinetic parameters, or QTc prolongation. However, additional pediatric studies are warranted to determine whether adult genotype‐informed prescribing guidelines can be used in children. While almost half the studies included in this review were published after the 2017 CPIC ondansetron/tropisetron guideline, there is insufficient evidence to support additional prescribing recommendations beyond this guideline.
