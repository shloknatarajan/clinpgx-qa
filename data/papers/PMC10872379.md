## Abstract

Some residues in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel are the site of more than one CFTR variant that cause cystic fibrosis. Here, we investigated the function of S1159F and S1159P, two variants associated with different clinical phenotypes, which affect the same pore-lining residue in transmembrane segment twelve that are both strongly potentiated by ivacaftor when expressed in CFBE41o− bronchial epithelial cells. To study the single-channel behaviour of CFTR, we applied the patch-clamp technique to Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing CFTR variants incubated at 27 °C to enhance channel residence at the plasma membrane. S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR formed Cl− channels activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and gated by ATP that exhibited thermostability at 37 °C. Both variants modestly reduced the single-channel conductance of CFTR. By severely attenuating channel gating, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR reduced the open probability (Po) of wild-type CFTR by ≥ 75% at ATP (1 mM); S1159F-CFTR caused the greater decrease in Po consistent with its more severe clinical phenotype. Ivacaftor (10 – 100 nM) doubled the Po of both CFTR variants without restoring Po values to wild-type levels, but concomitantly, ivacaftor decreased current flow through open channels. For S1159F-CFTR, the reduction of current flow was marked at high (supersaturated) ivacaftor concentrations (0.5 – 1 μM) and voltage-independent, identifying an additional detrimental action of elevated ivacaftor concentrations. In conclusion, S1159F and S1159P are gating variants, which also affect CFTR processing and conduction, but not stability, necessitating the use of combinations of CFTR modulators to optimally restore their channel activity.

## INTRODUCTION

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have transformed the treatment of the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) ([Ramsey et al., 2011](#R57); [Heijerman et al., 2019](#R31); [Middleton et al., 2019](#R54)). These drugs target the root cause of CF, pathogenic variants in the epithelial anion channel CFTR, not just in the respiratory airways, the major site of disease, but in all affected organs ([Ratjen et al., 2015](#R58); [Yeh et al., 2022](#R76)). Although most people with CF carry one or two copies of the predominant *CFTR* variant, c.1521_1523delCTT (p.Phe508del; legacy: F508del) ([Cutting, 2015](#R21)), over 2,100 sequence variations have been reported in the *CFTR* gene ([http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/](http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/)), of which approximately 800 have been thoroughly vetted ([https://cftr2.org/](https://cftr2.org/)). To ensure that CFTR modulators reach as many people with CF as possible, *CFTR* variants are grouped into theratypes based on (i) their impact on the synthesis, plasma membrane stability and function of CFTR and (ii) their response to CFTR modulators ([Cutting, 2015](#R21)).

Highlighting their importance for CFTR structure and function, some residues in CFTR are the site of more than one *CFTR* variant. One such residue is the serine at codon 1159 in the twelfth transmembrane segment (M12) that is part of membrane-spanning domain 2 (MSD2). Two rare missense substitutions are found at codon 1159: c.3476C>T (p.Ser1159Phe; legacy: S1159F) replaces the polar serine residue by the non-polar residue phenylalanine, whereas c.3475T>C (p.Ser1159Pro; legacy: S1159P) introduces the helix breaker proline ([Fig. 1](#F1)). For several reasons, we were keen to investigate these *CFTR* variants. First, they affect a pore-lining residue, which interacts with anions flowing through the CFTR channel ([Hwang et al., 2018](#R33)). Second, although the number of people with CF and S1159-*CFTR* variants is small, the two variants appear to bestow different disease phenotypes. S1159P appears to confer a non-classical clinical phenotype, demonstrated by its more common association with pancreatic sufficiency, lower mean sweat chloride concentration and the older average age of people with this variant, whereas S1159F likely confers a classical clinical phenotype expounded by its association with pancreatic insufficiency ([Table 1](#T1)) ([Knowles & Durie, 2002](#R36)) ([https://cftr2.org/](https://cftr2.org/)). However, no difference in CFTR-mediated transepithelial Cl^−^ current was observed when the two S1159-*CFTR* variants were heterologously expressed in the immortalized human CF bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o^−^ and studied with the Ussing chamber technique ([Han et al., 2018](#R30)). Third, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR-expressing CFBE41o^−^ epithelia exhibited a notable response to the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor ([Han et al., 2018](#R30)). Among 59 *CFTR* variants investigated, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR were classified with the *CFTR* gating variant c.1652G>A (p.Gly551Asp; legacy G551D) as high responders based on the magnitude of the increase in CFTR-mediated transepithelial Cl^−^ current achieved with ivacaftor ([Han et al., 2018](#R30)).

Therefore, we were interested to learn how S1159-*CFTR* variants affect the properties and regulation of the CFTR Cl^−^ channel and its response to ivacaftor. To address these aims, we heterologously expressed the S1159-*CFTR* variants in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and studied their single-channel behaviour in cell-free membrane patches with the patch-clamp technique. We discovered that both S1159-*CFTR* variants modestly reduced current flow through CFTR, but markedly attenuated channel gating with S1159F causing the harsher impact. Low nanomolar concentrations of ivacaftor doubled the activity of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR without achieving wild-type levels of activity, while higher (supersaturated) concentrations of ivacaftor caused voltage-independent inhibition of current flow through S1159F-CFTR. We conclude that S1159-*CFTR* variants cause conduction and gating defects that are partially rescued by ivacaftor. S1159F more severely impacts CFTR function consistent with its association with classical CF.

## METHODS

### Cells and CFTR expression

For single-channel studies of human *CFTR* variants, we used Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells (cat no. CCL-61, RRID:CVCL_0214; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). They were cultured in Ham’s F-12 nutrient medium (cat no. 21765–029) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (cat no. 26140–087), 100 U ml^−1^ penicillin and 100 μg ml^−1^ streptomycin (cat no. 15140–122) [all from Invitrogen (now Thermo Fisher Scientific), Paisley, UK] at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO_2_. CHO-K1 cells seeded on glass coverslips were co-transfected with *CFTR* variants and enhanced green fluorescent protein N1 (eGFP-N1, RRID:Addgene_172281) using the Lipofectamine 3000 system (cat no. L3000–001; Thermo Fisher Scientific). To increase the plasma membrane expression of S1159-*CFTR* variants, CHO cells were incubated at 27 °C for 7 – 12 days prior to study, changing media every second day ([Denning et al., 1992](#R23)). Then, GFP-expressing CHO-K1 cells were selected for study using the patch-clamp technique.

In some single-channel studies, control data were acquired from mouse mammary epithelial (C127) cells (RRID:CVCL_6550) stably expressing wild-type human CFTR [gift of C.R. O’Riordan (Sanofi Genzyme)] ([Marshall et al., 1994](#R51)). These cells were cultured and used as described previously ([Sheppard & Robinson, 1997](#R62)). C127 cells are the cell line of choice for single-channel studies of wild-type human CFTR because they express low levels of heterologously expressed CFTR ([Sheppard & Robinson, 1997](#R62)). Under the experimental conditions used, the single-channel behaviour of human CFTR in excised inside-out membrane patches from different mammalian cells is equivalent ([Lansdell et al., 1998](#R40); [Chen et al., 2009](#R13); [Bose et al., 2019](#R7)).

### Patch-clamp experiments

CFTR Cl^−^ channels were recorded in excised inside-out membrane patches using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier and pCLAMP software (version 10.4, RRID:SCR_011323) (both from Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) ([Cai et al., 2015](#R10)). Unless otherwise indicated, the pipette (extracellular) solution contained (mM): 140 *N*-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), 140 aspartic acid, 5 CaCl_2_, 2 MgSO_4_ and 10 *N*-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulphonic acid (TES), adjusted to pH 7.3 with Tris ([Cl^−^], 10 mM). The bath (intracellular) solution contained (mM): 140 NMDG, 3 MgCl_2_, 1 CsEGTA and 10 TES, adjusted to pH 7.3 with HCl ([Cl^−^], 147 mM; free [Ca^2+^], < 10^−8^ M). Using a temperature-controlled microscope stage (Brook Industries, Lake Villa, IL, USA), the temperature of the intracellular solution was maintained at 37 °C.

Within two minutes of membrane patch excision, we added the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA; 75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) to the intracellular solution to activate CFTR Cl^−^ channels. Wild-type CFTR Cl^−^ channels were activated at 37 °C, but those of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR were activated at 23 °C before raising the temperature of the intracellular solution to 37 °C once channel activation was complete. To minimise channel rundown, we added PKA (75 nM) to all intracellular solutions, maintained the ATP concentration at 1 mM unless investigating the ATP dependence of channel gating and clamped voltage at −50 mV. The effects of ivacaftor were studied by acquiring 3 – 8 min of single-channel data once channel activity stabilised following its addition to the intracellular solution in the continuous presence of PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM). Because of the difficulty of washing ivacaftor from the recording chamber ([Wang et al., 2014](#R73)), test interventions with ivacaftor were not compared with pre- and post-intervention control periods. Instead, they were compared with the pre-intervention control period made with the same concentration of PKA and ATP, but without ivacaftor. To investigate the action of ivacaftor at different voltages, we used symmetrical Cl^−^-rich solutions and stepped voltage from 0 mV to ±60 mV in 20 mV increments of 60 s at negative voltages, but 30 s duration at positive voltages. We chose 30 s voltage steps at positive voltages because this time interval was long enough to acquire sufficient transitions to quantify open probability (*P*_o_), but short enough to prevent seal breakdown and loss of excised inside-out membrane patches. We did not step voltage to voltages beyond ±60 mV because of the weak inward rectification of wild-type human CFTR Cl^−^ currents at large positive voltages ([Cai et al., 2003](#R11)).

In this study, we used excised inside-out membrane patches containing ≤ 5 active channels [wild-type CFTR, number of active channels (*N*) ≤ 4; S1159F-CFTR, ≤ 5; S1159P-CFTR, ≤ 5]. To determine channel number, we used the maximum number of simultaneous channel openings observed during an experiment ([Cai et al., 2006](#R12)). To minimise errors, we used experimental conditions that robustly potentiated channel activity and verified that recordings were of sufficient length to determine the correct number of channels ([Venglarik et al., 1994](#R71)). Despite our precautions, we cannot exclude the possibility of unobserved S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR Cl^−^ channels in excised membrane patches. Therefore, *P*_o_ values for S1159-*CFTR* variants might possibly be overestimated.

Single-channel currents were acquired directly to computer hard disc after filtering at a corner frequency (*f*_c_) of 500 Hz using an eight-pole Bessel filter (model F-900C/9L8L, Frequency Devices Inc., Ottawa, IL, USA) and digitising at a sampling rate of 5 kHz using a DigiData 1440A interface (Molecular Devices) and pCLAMP software (version 10.4). To measure single-channel current amplitude (*i*), Gaussian distributions were fit to current amplitude histograms. Using *i* values at negative voltages, we calculated single-channel conductance where the single-channel current-voltage relationship is linear in the presence of a large Cl^−^ concentration gradient ([Fig. 4B](#F4)) ([Sheppard et al., 1993](#R61)). For *P*_o_ measurements, lists of open- and closed-times were generated using a half-amplitude crossing criterion for event detection and dwell time histograms constructed as previously described ([Sheppard & Robinson, 1997](#R62)); transitions < 1 ms were excluded from the analysis [eight-pole Bessel filter rise time (*T*_10–90_) ~0.73 ms at *f*_c_ = 500 Hz]. Histograms were fitted with one or more component exponential functions using the maximum likelihood method. For burst analyses, we used a *t*_c_ (the time that separates interburst closures from intraburst closures) determined from closed time histograms [wild-type CFTR, *t*_c_ = 13.3 ± 2.4 ms (*n* = 4); S1159F-CFTR, *t*_c_ = 21.5 ± 6.3 ms (*n* = 15); S1159P-CFTR, *t*_c_ = 21.8 ± 5.9 ms (*n* = 13) determined in the presence of ATP (1 mM)] ([Cai et al., 2006](#R12)). The mean interburst interval (*T*_IBI_) was calculated using the equation ([Cai et al., 2006](#R12)):

| Po=Tb/(TMBD+TIBI), | (Eq. 1) |
| --- | --- |
where, *T*_b_ = (mean burst duration) x (open probability within a burst). Mean burst duration (*T*_MBD_) and open probability within a burst (*P*_o(burst)_) were determined directly from experimental data using pCLAMP software. Only membrane patches that contained a single active channel were used for burst analyses. For illustration purposes, single-channel records were filtered at 500 Hz and digitised at 5 kHz before file size compression by 5-fold data reduction.

ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM) were continuously present in the intracellular solution. Dotted lines indicate the closed channel state and downward deflections correspond to channel openings. B and C, single-channel current-voltage (i–V) relationships and summary slope conductance data of wild-type, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR. Data are means ± SD (wild-type, n = 11–14; S1159F-CFTR, n = 3–5; S1159P-CFTR, n = 7–9). In B, the continuous lines are the fit of first order linear regression functions to mean data (r2 > 0.99), while in C, symbols represent individual values.

### Reagents

PKA purified from bovine heart (cat no. 539576–25UG) was purchased from Calbiochem (now Merck Life Science UK Ltd.) (Gillingham, UK). Ivacaftor (cat no. S1144) was obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Stratech Scientific Ltd., Newmarket, UK), while all other chemicals, including ATP (disodium salt) (cat no. A2383–1G) and TES (cat no. T1375–500G) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Ltd. (now Merck Life Science UK Ltd.).

Stock solutions of ATP were prepared in intracellular solution directly before each experiment. Ivacaftor stock solutions were solubilised in DMSO before storage at –20 °C. Immediately before use, stock solutions were diluted to final concentrations with intracellular solution and, where necessary, the pH of the intracellular solution was readjusted to pH 7.3 to avoid pH-dependent changes in CFTR function ([Chen et al., 2009](#R13)). DMSO was without effect on the single-channel activity of CFTR ([Sheppard & Robinson, 1997](#R62)). On completion of experiments, the recording chamber was thoroughly cleaned before re-use ([Wang et al., 2014](#R73)).

### Modelling

Using the atomic structure of phosphorylated ATP-bound human CFTR complexed with ivacaftor (PDB id: 6O2P; [Liu et al., 2019](#R48)), we investigated the impact of the rare *CFTR* variants at codon 1159 in M12 on CFTR structure. [Figure 1](#F1) was made using PyMOL software (version 2.3.0) (RRID:SCR_000305).

### Statistics

Data recording and analyses were randomised, but not blinded. To avoid pseudo-replication, all experiments were repeated at different times. Results are expressed as means ± SD of *n* observations, where *n* represents the number of individual excised inside-out membrane patches obtained from different cells from either ≥ 5 transfections for S1159-*CFTR* variants or ≥ 4 passages of cells for wild-type CFTR. However, some group sizes were unequal due to technical difficulties with the acquisition of single-channel data. All data were tested for normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk normality test. To test for differences between two groups of data acquired within the same experiment, we used Student’s paired t-test. To test for differences between multiple groups of data, we used one-way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by either Dunnett’s or Tukey multiple comparison test when a statistically significant difference was observed. Data subjected to statistical analyses had *n* values ≥ 5 per group. Tests were performed using SigmaPlot (version 14.0, RRID:SCR_003210; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Differences were considered statistically significant when *P* < 0.05.

## RESULTS

### S1159-CFTR variants perturb the single-channel conductance and gating behaviour of CFTR

In this study, we investigated the impact on human CFTR function and response to ivacaftor of two rare *CFTR* variants S1159F and S1159P, which affect the same pore-lining residue in M12 ([Fig. 1](#F1)). To study these *CFTR* variants, we used transiently transfected CHO cells incubated at 27 °C for ≥ 7 days to promote the plasma membrane expression of CFTR. With the patch-clamp technique, we examined the properties and regulation of CFTR Cl^−^ channels and the action of ivacaftor.

[Figure 2](#F2) and [Figure 3A](#F3) show representative multi- and single-channel recordings, respectively, of wild-type, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR in excised inside-out membrane patches from CHO cells acquired at −50 mV with ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM) in the intracellular solution. Consistent with previous results ([Han et al., 2018](#R30)), the multi-channel recordings, each acquired using membrane patches with four active channels, demonstrate that the S1159-*CFTR* variants diminished strongly CFTR activity ([Fig. 2](#F2)). [Figure 3A](#F3) reveals that S1159-*CFTR* variants attenuated the single-channel behaviour of CFTR in two important ways. First, S1159F and S1159P reduced current flow through open channels. At −50 mV in the presence of a large Cl^−^ concentration gradient ([Cl^−^]_int_, 147 mM; [Cl^−^]_ext_, 10 mM), the single-channel current amplitude (*i*) of CFTR was reduced by 24 and 21% by S1159F and S1159P, respectively, ([Fig. 3A](#F3) and [B](#F3)). To further quantify the reduction in current flow, we constructed single-channel current-voltage (*i*-*V*) relationships and measured single-channel conductance. Using a large Cl^−^ concentration gradient, the *i*-*V* relationship of wild-type CFTR strongly inwardly rectifies, but at negative voltages, it is linear ([Sheppard et al., 1993](#R61)). [Figure 4A](#F4) shows representative single-channel recordings of wild-type, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR at different membrane voltages using these experimental conditions, while [Figure 4B](#F4) presents the summary single-channel *i*-*V* relationships. At negative voltages, the calculated single-channel slope conductances of S1159F-CFTR (8.63 ± 0.55 pS; *n* = 3) and S1159P-CFTR (7.91 ± 1.46 pS; *n* = 7) were modestly reduced compared to that of wild-type CFTR (9.78 ± 0.81 pS; *n* = 6) ([Fig. 4C](#F4)).

Representative multi-channel recordings and corresponding current amplitude histograms of wild-type (A), S1159F- (B) and S1159P-CFTR (C) in excised inside-out membrane patches from transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells. ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM) were continuously present in the intracellular solution. Dotted lines indicate the closed channel state, arrowheads identify different open channel current levels and downward deflections correspond to channel openings. The labels C and O1 – O4 denote the closed and open channel amplitudes, respectively. Because openings of the S1159-CFTR variants to O3 and O4 were rare, they are not apparent in the current amplitude histograms. Unless otherwise indicated in this and subsequent figures, membrane voltage was clamped at −50 mV, a large Cl− concentration gradient was imposed across the membrane patch ([Cl−]int, 147 mM; [Cl−]ext, 10 mM) and temperature was 37 °C.

The labels C and O denote the closed and open channel amplitudes, respectively. B–E, summary single-channel current amplitude (i), interburst interval (IBI), mean burst duration (MBD) and open probability (Po) data determined from prolonged recordings (≥ 4 min) of wild-type, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR for the experimental conditions described in A. Symbols represent individual values and columns represent means ± SD (wild-type: i and Po, n = 15; MBD and IBI, n = 8; S1159F: i and Po, n = 22; MBD and IBI, n = 15; S1159P: i and Po, n = 24; MBD and IBI, n = 13). [Panel B: ***P < 0.001 vs. wild-type CFTR; one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test; normality test (Shapiro–Wilk), P < 0.050 (failed); equal variance test (Brown-Forsythe), P = 0.350 (passed). Panel C: *P = 0.013 and **P = 0.001 vs. wild-type CFTR; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on Ranks with Dunn’s post-hoc test; normality test (Shapiro–Wilk), P < 0.050 (failed). Panel D: ***P < 0.001 vs. wild-type CFTR; one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test; normality test (Shapiro–Wilk), P = 0.620 (passed); equal variance test (Brown-Forsythe), P = 0.050 (passed). Panel E: ***P < 0.001 vs. wild-type CFTR; one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test; normality test (Shapiro–Wilk), P = 0.490 (passed); equal variance test (Brown-Forsythe), P < 0.050 (failed)].

Second, S1159F and S1159P disrupted the pattern of channel gating. The gating pattern of wild-type CFTR is characterized by bursts of channel openings interrupted by brief, flickery closures, separated by longer closures between bursts ([Fig. 3A](#F3)). Although both *CFTR* variants retained a bursting pattern of channel gating, the frequency of channel openings and their duration were greatly decreased. Burst analysis revealed that the interburst interval (IBI, the average duration of the long closures separating one open channel burst from the next) was increased by 637 and 460% for S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR, respectively, while mean burst duration (MBD, the average duration of an open channel burst) was reduced by 70 and 44% for S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR, respectively, using PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) ([Fig. 3A](#F3), [C](#F3) and [D](#F3)). As a result, the *P*_o_ of CFTR was diminished 89 and 74% by S1159F and S1159P, respectively, ([Fig. 3E](#F3)).

To understand better the impact of the S1159-*CFTR* variants on CFTR channel gating, we investigated gating kinetics using membrane patches that contained only a single active CFTR Cl^−^ channel. Like those of wild-type CFTR, the open and closed time histograms of the S1159-*CFTR* variants were best fitted with one- and two-component exponential functions, respectively, ([Fig. 5](#F5) and [Table 2](#T2)). The two populations of channel closures, described by fast (τ_C1_) and slow (τ_C3_) closed time constants, represented the brief, flickery closures that interrupt open channel bursts and the prolonged channel closures, which separate one open channel burst from the next ([Table 2](#T2)) ([Sheppard & Robinson, 1997](#R62)). Consistent with the analysis of bursts ([Fig. 3C](#F3) and [D](#F3)), [Figure 5](#F5) and [Table 2](#T2) suggest that the diminished *P*_o_ values of the S1159-*CFTR* variants were predominantly caused by lengthening of the slow closed time constant (τ_C3_) (S1159F, 514%; S1159P, 132%), although both variants also noticeably reduced the open time constant (τ_O2_) (S1159F, 78%; S1159P, 68%). [Figure 5](#F5) and [Table 2](#T2) also reveal that the fast closed time constant (τ_C1_) of the S1159-*CFTR* variants tended to be longer than that of wild-type CFTR, while its share of the closed time distribution was slightly decreased. Thus, the S1159-*CFTR* variants cause severe channel gating defects with S1159F-CFTR exerting the stronger effect.

### S1159-CFTR variants disrupt channel gating by ATP

Following CFTR phosphorylation by PKA, channel gating is controlled by cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs, which drive conformational changes in the MSDs that open and close the CFTR pore ([Hwang et al., 2018](#R33)). Therefore, we hypothesized that the defective channel gating of S1159-*CFTR* variants might reflect altered affinity and/or efficacy of channel gating by ATP. To test this idea, we examined the ATP-dependence of channel gating using excised membrane patches containing ≤ 4 active channels bathed in different ATP concentrations (0.03 – 3 mM) in the continuous presence of PKA (75 nM).

[Figure 6A](#F6) shows representative single-channel recordings of wild-type CFTR, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR acquired at different intracellular ATP concentrations and [Figure 6B](#F6) summary *P*_o_-ATP concentration relationships. Like that of wild-type CFTR, *P*_o_ values of the S1159-*CFTR* variants increased as the ATP concentration was elevated because IBI values decreased with little or no change in MBD values ([Fig. 6B](#F6) – [D](#F6)). However, at all ATP concentrations tested, *P*_o_ values of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR were greatly reduced compared to those of wild-type CFTR ([Fig. 6B](#F6)). By fitting Michaelis–Menten functions to mean data ([Fig. 6B](#F6)), we calculated values of *K*_D_ (the ATP concentration required for half-maximal activity, which describes the apparent affinity of CFTR for ATP) and *P*_o(max)_ (the maximum *P*_o_). For wild-type CFTR, *K*_D_ = 0.35 mM and *P*_o(max)_ = 0.47 (*r*^2^ = 0.97), for S1159F-CFTR, *K*_D_ = 0.48 mM and *P*_o(max)_ = 0.08 (*r*^2^ = 0.93) and for S1159P-CFTR, *K*_D_ = 1.42 mM and *P*_o(max)_ = 0.27 (*r*^2^ = 0.96). These data suggest that both S1159-*CFTR* variants greatly decrease the efficacy with which ATP gates the CFTR Cl^−^ channel with S1159P-CFTR also reducing the apparent affinity of ATP for CFTR.

### Figure 6. Impact of S1159-CFTR variants on the ATP-dependent channel gating of CFTR.

A, representative single-channel recordings of wild-type-, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR in excised inside-out membrane patches from transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells acquired using the indicated intracellular ATP concentrations. PKA (75 nM) was continuously present in the intracellular solution. Dotted lines indicate the closed channel state and downward deflections correspond to channel openings. B–D, relationship between ATP concentration and open probability (Po), mean burst duration (MBD) and interburst interval (IBI) for wild-type and S1159-CFTR variants; note that in D, the y-axis is plotted using a logarithmic scale. Data are means ± SD (wild-type: Po, n = 11–23; MBD and IBI, n = 6–8; S1159F: Po, n = 2–22; MBD and IBI, n = 2–15; S1159P: Po, S1159P, n = 11–24; MBD and IBI, n = 7–13) from experiments where ≥ 3 ATP concentrations were tested in each membrane patch. In B, the continuous lines are the fit of Michaelis–Menten functions to mean data (r2 ≥ 0.93).

Thus, S1159F and S1159P form PKA-activated, ATP-gated CFTR Cl^−^ channels. They modestly reduce current flow through open channels, but severely decrease *P*_o_ by markedly attenuating the frequency and duration of channel openings. These data indicate that both *CFTR* variants cause class III (regulation) and class IV (conduction) defects ([Welsh & Smith, 1993](#R74)). However, channel activity of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR was sustained in excised inside-out membrane patches at 37 °C in the presence of PKA and ATP in the intracellular solution (*n* ≥ 60; H Li, M Rodrat and DN Sheppard; data not shown). We therefore conclude that S1159-*CFTR* variants do not disrupt the plasma membrane stability of CFTR ([Haardt et al., 1999](#R29)).

### S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR have distinct responses to ivacaftor

Like its effect on G551D-CFTR, ivacaftor robustly potentiated S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR when heterologously expressed in the immortalized human CF bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o^−^ and studied with the Ussing chamber technique ([Han et al., 2018](#R30)). To understand better the action of ivacaftor on S1159-*CFTR* variants, we acutely added ivacaftor [10 – 1000 nM, where 500 and 1000 nM are supersaturated concentrations ([Csanády & Töröcsik, 2019](#R18))] to the intracellular solution bathing excised inside-out membrane patches in the continuous presence of ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM) and studied single-channel behaviour.

[Figure 7A](#F7) shows representative recordings of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR in the absence and presence of ivacaftor (50 and 500 nM) and [Figure 7B](#F7) summary *P*_o_-ivacaftor concentration relationships. As controls, [Figure 8A](#F8) and [Wang et al. (2018)](#R72) show representative single-channel recordings of wild-type and F508del-CFTR in the absence and presence of different concentrations of ivacaftor. By increasing the frequency of channel openings, but not their duration, ivacaftor (10 – 100 nM) doubled the *P*_o_ of both S1159-CFTR variants ([Fig. 7A](#F7) and [B](#F7)). However, the drug did not restore wild-type levels of channel activity (as measured by *P*_o_) to these *CFTR* variants ([Figs. 3E](#F3) and [7A](#F7) and [B](#F7)). Higher (supersaturated) concentrations of ivacaftor did not increase further the *P*_o_ of either S1159F- or S1159P-CFTR ([Fig. 7B](#F7)).

Ivacaftor (VX-770, 50 and 500 nM) was acutely added to the intracellular solution in the continuous presence of ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM). Dotted lines indicate the closed channel state, downward deflections correspond to channel openings and teal is used to identify single-channel recordings acquired at a supersaturated concentration of ivacaftor.

D and E, single-channel current-voltage (i–V) relationships of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR in the absence and presence of ivacaftor (50 and 500 nM) in the intracellular solution.

In C–E, the continuous lines are the fit of first order linear regression functions to mean data (C, r2 > 0.90; D and E, r2 > 0.98), whereas in B, they are the fit of peak log normal functions to mean data.

### Figure 8. Effects of ivacaftor on the single-channel behaviour of wild-type and S1159F-CFTR at different membrane voltages.

A and B, representative single-channel recordings and corresponding current amplitude histograms of wild-type and S1159F-CFTR in excised inside-out membrane patches from CFTR-expressing C127 and CHO cells, respectively. The recordings were acquired at ±50 mV in the absence and presence of ivacaftor (VX-770; 100 and 1000 nM). Membrane patches were bathed in symmetrical 147 mM Cl− solutions, ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM) were continuously present in the intracellular solution and temperature was 37 °C. Dotted lines indicate the closed channel state and downward deflections at −50 mV and upward deflections at +50 mV correspond to channel openings. The labels C and O denote the closed and open channel amplitudes, respectively. In A and B, teal is used to identify single-channel recordings and current amplitude histograms acquired at a supersaturated concentration of ivacaftor. For ivacaftor (100 and 1000 nM), small leak currents at +50 mV shifted the current amplitude histograms of S1159F-CFTR by ~ 0.2 pA and 1.8 pA relative to that of the control. For summary single-channel current-voltage (i–V) and open probability-voltage (Po–V) relationships of wild-type and S1159F-CFTR, see Figure 10.

In three membrane patches with single active S1159F-CFTR Cl^−^ channels, we investigated the effects of ivacaftor on the variant’s gating kinetics. In the presence of ivacaftor (50 nM), the open and closed time histograms of S1159F-CFTR remained best fitted with one- and two-component exponential functions described by the same open (τ_O2_) and closed (τ_C1_, τ_C3_) time constants ([Fig. 9](#F9) and [Table 3](#T3)). Of note, ivacaftor (50 nM) decreased the slow closed time constant (τ_C3_) of S1159F-CFTR by 83% to approach that of wild-type CFTR ([Figs. 5](#F5) and [9](#F9) and [Tables 2](#T2) and [3](#T3)). However, the drug was without effect on either the open time constant (τ_O2_) or the fast closed time constant (τ_C1_) of S1159F-CFTR, which remained greatly reduced and slightly prolonged, respectively, compared with those of wild-type CFTR ([Figs. 5](#F5) and [9](#F9) and [Tables 2](#T2) and [3](#T3)).

Table 3 Caption: Effects of ivacaftor (50 nM) on the open and closed time constants of S1159F-CFTR

In contrast to its effects on wild-type CFTR [[Fig. 8A](#F8) and [Wang et al. (2018)](#R72)], ivacaftor steadily reduced the *i* of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR at −50 mV ([Fig. 7C](#F7)). [Figure 7C](#F7) demonstrates that as the ivacaftor concentration increased, the reduction of *i* at −50 mV was modest for S1159P-CFTR, but marked for S1159F-CFTR, such that at the supersaturated ivacaftor concentration of 500 nM, the *i* of S1159F-CFTR was 36% reduced. To understand better this effect of ivacaftor, we constructed single-channel *i*-*V* relationships at negative voltages for the S1159-*CFTR* variants in the absence and presence of ivacaftor (50 and 500 nM) ([Fig. 7D](#F7) and [E](#F7)). Ivacaftor (500 nM) caused a slight reduction of the single-channel conductance of S1159P-CFTR, but a substantial decrease for S1159F-CFTR [S1159F-CFTR: control, 8.63 ± 0.55 pS; ivacaftor (500 nM), 4.85 ± 1.06 pS; *n* = 3; S1159P-CFTR: control = 8.25 ± 1.26 pS; ivacaftor (500 nM), 7.57 ± 1.38 pS; *n* = 3 – 4].

### Ivacaftor inhibition of current flow through S1159F-CFTR is voltage independent

Previous work has identified two mechanisms of CFTR inhibition by small molecules: open-channel blockade and allosteric inhibition ([Li & Sheppard, 2009](#R45)). Open-channel blockers physically occlude the CFTR pore leading to rectification of the *i*-*V* relationship, whereas allosteric inhibitors act remotely to abrogate current flow through the channel at all voltages tested. To understand better how ivacaftor inhibits S1159F-CFTR, we bathed excised membrane patches in symmetrical Cl^−^-rich solutions and recorded the single-channel activity of S1159F-CFTR from –60 mV to +60 mV in 20 mV increments in the absence and presence of ivacaftor (100 and 1000 nM) in the intracellular solution, which contained ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM).

[Figure 8](#F8) shows representative recordings and corresponding current amplitude histograms at ±50 mV of wild-type and S1159F-CFTR Cl^−^ channels in the absence and presence of ivacaftor (100 nM) and the supersaturated ivacaftor concentration of 1000 nM when bathed in symmetrical Cl^−^-rich solutions. For wild-type, ivacaftor enhanced greatly the frequency and duration of channel openings at both voltages, without reducing current flow through the channel ([Fig. 8A](#F8)). By contrast, the potentiation of S1159F-CFTR channel gating at both voltages was less marked, while its *i* was reduced ([Fig. 8B](#F8)). These different effects of ivacaftor on wild-type and S1159F-CFTR are emphasized by the distinct changes in the single-channel current amplitude histograms elicited by increasing drug concentrations ([Fig. 8](#F8)).

[Figure 10](#F10) shows summary single-channel *P*_o_-*V* and *i*-*V* relationships for wild-type and S1159F-CFTR. For wild-type CFTR, ivacaftor potentiation of *P*_o_ was concentration-dependent, but voltage-independent, while both its *i*-*V* relationship and single-channel conductance were unaffected by increasing concentrations of the drug ([Fig. 10A](#F10) – [C](#F10)). Although ivacaftor potentiation of the *P*_o_ of S1159F-CFTR was voltage-independent, *P*_o_ values were maximal at ivacaftor (100 nM) and not further increased at the supersaturated ivacaftor concentration of 1000 nM ([Fig. 10D](#F10)). However, ivacaftor (1000 nM) caused a voltage-independent inhibition of the *i*-*V* relationship of S1159F-CFTR, which reduced the single-channel conductance of S1159F-CFTR 2-fold ([Fig. 10E](#F10) and [F](#F10)). Thus, ivacaftor potentiation of S1159F-CFTR is reduced by allosteric channel inhibition.

## DISCUSSION

This study investigated the single-channel behaviour and response to ivacaftor of two rare *CFTR* variants, S1159F and S1159P, which affect the same pore-lining residue in M12. Both *CFTR* variants modestly decreased single-channel conductance, but severely inhibited channel gating. Nanomolar concentrations of ivacaftor potentiated both *CFTR* variants without restoring to them wild-type levels of channel activity, while higher (supersaturated) concentrations decreased the single-channel conductance of S1159F-CFTR.

Many *CFTR* variants, quite likely the majority, cause CFTR dysfunction by several mechanisms. This is highlighted by F508del, which causes a temperature-sensitive folding defect that all but abolishes the biosynthesis of CFTR protein, severely diminishes its plasma membrane stability and gravely disrupts channel gating ([Cheng et al., 1990](#R14); [Dalemans et al., 1991](#R22); [Denning et al., 1992](#R23); [Lukacs et al., 1993](#R50)), leading to its categorization as a class II-III-VI *CFTR* variant using the combinatorial classification system for *CFTR* variants ([Veit et al., 2016](#R68)). The present results and other data ([Han et al., 2018](#R30); [McCarthy et al., 2018](#R52)) reveal that S1159F and S1159P cause conduction and gating defects that diminish CFTR function and suggest that they likely interfere with the biosynthesis of CFTR protein, without affecting its plasma membrane stability. Two lines of evidence suggest that the S1159-*CFTR* variants reduce the plasma membrane expression of CFTR protein. First, CFTR correctors enhanced the magnitude of CFTR-mediated Cl^−^ currents generated by immortalized CFBE41o^−^ and Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells heterologously expressing S1159-*CFTR* variants and nasal epithelia from a person with CF with the genotype F508del/S1159P ([Han et al., 2018](#R30); [Bihler et al., 2023](#R5); [McCarthy et al., 2018](#R52)). Second, low temperature incubation for ≥ 7 days was required to optimise the plasma membrane expression of S1159-*CFTR* variants for single-channel studies (present study). Consistent with these data, S1159F and S1159P were two of the 177 *CFTR* variants approved for elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy when the FDA expanded the drug’s label ([https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s008lbl.pdf](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s008lbl.pdf)). Thus, the molecular basis of CFTR dysfunction caused by the S1159-*CFTR* variants is class II, III and IV defects ([Welsh & Smith, 1993](#R74)), leading to their classification as class II-III *CFTR* variants using the combinatorial classification system ([Veit et al., 2016](#R68)).

When compared with other *CFTR* variants in the MSDs that disrupt Cl^−^ flow through the CFTR channel (e.g. [Sheppard et al., 1993](#R61); [Tabcharani et al., 1993](#R64); [Sheppard et al., 1996](#R63); [Gong & Linsdell, 2004](#R28)), the impact of S1159-*CFTR* variants was reduced. A potential explanation for the diminished severity of these variants on the single-channel conductance of CFTR is the location of S1159 within the CFTR pore. S1159 lies in the deep intracellular vestibule at a level close to the lateral tunnel beneath M4 and M6 through which anions enter the CFTR pore on the intracellular side ([Li et al., 2018](#R46); [Zhang et al., 2018](#R80); [Hoffmann et al., 2018](#R32)). At this level, the intracellular vestibule is relatively wide compared to the pore constriction located towards the extracellular side of the plasma membrane ([Liu et al., 2017](#R47); [Zhang et al., 2018](#R80)) and other *CFTR* variants in this region have little impact on current flow through the channel (e.g. [Seibert et al., 1996](#R60)). Instead, the reduced single-channel conductances of the S1159-*CFTR* variants might reflect their disruption of the hydrogen bond between S1159 and D979 (M9) ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Moreover, the bulky phenylalanine of S1159F clashes with residues in M9, requiring the two transmembrane segments to be further apart in this region, while the proline of S1159P, a known helix breaker ([Brandl & Deber, 1986](#R8)), likely destabilises M12. In support of these ideas, the open-channel pore of CFTR is stabilized by salt-bridges formed between residues in adjacent transmembrane segments [e.g. R347 (M6)-D924 (M8) and R352 (M6)-D993 (M9); Cotten & Welsh, 1999; [Cui et al., 2008](#R20); [Zhang et al., 2018](#R80)].

By reducing the frequency and duration of channel openings both S1159-*CFTR* variants severely disrupted the ATP-dependence of CFTR channel gating. These actions of S1159-*CFTR* variants are reminiscent of the *CFTR* gating variants G551D and G1349D ([Li et al., 1996](#R44); [Cai et al., 2006](#R12); [Bompadre et al., 2007](#R6)). G551D and G1349D affect key residue in the ABC signature motifs that line the ATP-binding sites located at the NBD1:NBD2 dimer interface [G551D: ATP-binding site 2 (hydrolytic); G1349D: ATP-binding site 1 (non-hydrolytic)] ([Aleksandrov et al., 2002](#R1); [Lewis et al., 2004](#R43); [Liu et al., 2017](#R47); [Zhang et al., 2018](#R80)). G551D-CFTR obstructs conformational changes subsequent to ATP binding leading to the loss of ATP-dependent channel gating, whereas G1349D greatly reduces the rate of channel opening and accelerates the rate of channel closure ([Cai et al., 2006](#R12); [Bompadre et al., 2007](#R6)). The location of S1159 at the intracellular end of M12, distant from the ATP-binding sites, suggests that S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR act allosterically to perturb channel gating. Consistent with this idea, [Kogan et al. (2001)](#R37) demonstrated that obstruction of the CFTR pore either by the open-channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate or mutagenesis inhibited the ATPase activity of CFTR. Moreover, by combining single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements with single-channel recording with planar lipid bilayers, [Levring et al. (2023)](#R42) revealed that c.2780T>C (p.Leu927Pro; legacy: L927P), a *CFTR* variant located in M8 near the transmembrane gating hinge, prevents formation of a tight NBD1:NBD2 dimer and subsequent allosteric coupling, leading to channel opening. Based on these lines of evidence, we posit that the S1159-*CFTR* variants disrupt channel gating by acting allosterically either to inhibit NBD1:NBD2 dimer formation or interfere with coupling between the ATP-binding sites and the transmembrane gating hinge in M8.

Ivacaftor potentiated S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR channel gating leading to a doubling of *P*_o_ at nanomolar concentrations. However, the drug’s efficacy was conspicuously reduced when compared with its action on the S1159-*CFTR* variants heterologously expressed in the immortalized human CF bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o^−^ ([Han et al., 2018](#R30)). Previous work suggests several possible explanations for this difference. First, in epithelia, CFTR activity is modulated by ion channels, transporters and interacting proteins that establish and/or modify the electrochemical gradient for transmembrane anion flow, whereas in cell-free membrane patches, CFTR function is studied directly. Second, CFTR phosphorylation might differ between intact cells and excised inside-out membrane patches, affecting the action of ivacaftor ([Cui et al., 2019](#R19)). Under the experimental conditions used, CFTR was continuously phosphorylated by the constant presence of PKA and ATP, whereas *in vivo* the cellular concentrations of nucleotides determine that the balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activity controls CFTR function ([Anderson et al., 1991](#R3); [Anderson & Welsh, 1992](#R2); [Traut, 1994](#R66); [Frizzell & Hanrahan, 2012](#R26)). Third, the cells used for heterologous expression of CFTR [[Han et al. (2018)](#R30): CFBE41o^−^ cells; present study: CHO cells] might influence CFTR function in different ways. Consistent with this idea, [Tomati et al. (2023)](#R65) found that elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor co-potentiated the *CFTR* variant c.3731G>A (p.Gly1244Glu; legacy: G1244E) when heterologously expressed in CFBE41o^−^ and FRT cells, but enhanced the plasma membrane expression of CFTR protein in nasal epithelial cells endogenously expressing this *CFTR* variant. Fourth, evidence for cooperativity in CFTR channel gating ([Krouse & Wine, 2001](#R38)) argues that S1159-*CFTR* variants would exhibit greater activity heterologously expressed in polarized CFBE41o^−^ epithelia where channel density is higher than in excised membrane patches selected for low numbers of active channels. Finally, other factors arising from differences in experimental conditions, most notably the different concentrations of ivacaftor studied [[Han et al. (2018)](#R30): 10 μM; present study: 0.01 – 1 μM] might explain the divergent results. Although unlikely to explain the different results obtained by [Han et al. (2018)](#R30) and the present study, inflammatory mediators have recently been identified as important regulators of CFTR modulator efficacy that act non-cell autonomously ([Gentzsch et al., 2021](#R27); [Rehman et al., 2021](#R59)).

Once the R domain is phosphorylated by PKA, ivacaftor potentiates both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent channel gating by CFTR ([Eckford et al., 2012](#R24); [Jih & Hwang, 2013](#R34)). To prevent irreversible loss of channel activity ([Yeh et al., 2021](#R77)), we did not investigate whether ivacaftor potentiates ATP-independent channel gating by the S1159-*CFTR* variants. Ivacaftor potentiation of ATP-dependent channel gating by the S1159-*CFTR* variants differed from the drug’s actions on F508del-CFTR in two important respects. First, the different effects of ivacaftor on the pattern of channel gating. Ivacaftor enhanced the frequency of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR channel openings without prolonging their duration. By contrast, it increased both the frequency and duration of F508del-CFTR channel openings ([Van Goor et al., 2009](#R67); [Wang et al., 2014](#R73)). Evidence from biochemical, structural and functional studies ([Cholon et al., 2014](#R16); [Meng et al., 2017](#R53); [Byrnes et al., 2018](#R9); [Wang et al., 2018](#R72)) argue that ivacaftor promotes channel opening by destabilizing a closed channel conformation. Consistent with this idea, the ivacaftor-binding site involves the unstructured region of M8, which gates the channel ([Liu et al., 2017](#R47); [Zhang et al., 2018](#R80); [Liu et al., 2019](#R48); [Yeh et al., 2019](#R75)). An explanation for the prolongation of channel openings by ivacaftor is provided by the energetic coupling model of CFTR channel gating ([Jih et al., 2012](#R35)), which revealed that the drug uncouples the gating and catalytic cycles of CFTR ([Jih & Hwang, 2013](#R34)). Alternatively, it might impede channel closure by stabilizing a pre-hydrolytic open state ([Langron et al., 2018](#R39)) or bind simultaneously to two independent drug-binding sites with equivalent affinities ([Csanády & Töröcsik, 2019](#R18)). The unstable short-lived open-state of the S1159-*CFTR* variants might explain the failure of ivacaftor to prolong the channel openings of these *CFTR* variants.

The second aspect of ivacaftor potentiation of the S1159-*CFTR* variants which differed from F508del-CFTR was the amount of rescued CFTR function. Ivacaftor doubled the *P*_o_ of S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR without restoring to them the *P*_o_ of wild-type CFTR. This result contrasts with the drug’s action on F508del and other *CFTR* variants including, c.1646G>A (p.Ser549Asn; legacy: S549N), c.1682C>A (p.Ala561Glu; legacy: A561E) and G1244E, where ivacaftor enhanced *P*_o_ markedly ([Van Goor et al., 2009](#R67), [Yu et al., 2012](#R78), [Wang et al., 2014](#R73)). However, the present data concur with the effects of ivacaftor on G551D, where despite a large enhancement of *P*_o_, wild-type levels were not achieved ([Van Goor et al., 2009](#R67); [Yu et al., 2012](#R78); [Wang et al., 2014](#R73); [Liu et al., 2022](#R49)). One potential strategy to restore greater function to the S1159-*CFTR* variants is co-potentiation, the use of two or more potentiators that act at different sites on CFTR to additively enhance channel gating ([Phuan et al., 2018](#R55)). To date, co-potentiation has been tested on a limited number of *CFTR* variants with mixed results: some variants (e.g. G551D and G1244E) were amenable to co-potentiation, but others (e.g. F508del and A561E) were not ([Phuan et al., 2019](#R56); [Veit et al., 2020](#R70); [Liu et al., 2022](#R49)). Based on values of fractional plasma membrane activity (an indirect measure of *P*_o_ relative to that of wild-type CFTR), [Veit et al. (2020)](#R70) concluded that *CFTR* gating variants with fractional plasma membrane activity lower than wild-type were receptive to co-potentiation, whereas those with activity equivalent to wild-type were unresponsive. Interestingly, by combining ivacaftor with the high-affinity ATP analogue *N*^6^-(2-phenylethyl)-2’-deoxy-ATP and substituting NO_3_^−^ for Cl^−^ as the permeant anion, [Yu et al. (2016)](#R79) achieved almost complete reversal of the gating defect for the *CFTR* variant c.350G>A (p.Arg117His; legacy: R117H). These data suggest that co-potentiation should augment the restoration of channel function to S1159-*CFTR* variants. Future studies should test this idea.

Previous studies demonstrate that micromolar concentrations of ivacaftor attenuate the plasma membrane expression and function of some *CFTR* variants ([Cholon et al., 2014](#R16); [Veit et al., 2014](#R69); [Wang et al., 2014](#R73); [Avramescu et al., 2017](#R4)). For example, micromolar concentrations of ivacaftor inhibit F508del-CFTR both by destabilizing its structure ([Cholon et al., 2014](#R16); [Veit et al., 2014](#R69)) and disrupting the integrity of the lipid bilayer ([Chin et al., 2018](#R15)). The physicochemical properties of ivacaftor provide an explanation for the deleterious actions of micromolar concentrations of ivacaftor on CFTR ([Csanády & Töröcsik, 2019](#R18)). The aqueous solubility of ivacaftor at 37 °C is 138 nM, its octanol/water distribution coefficient is ~60000 (i.e. when [ivacaftor]_aqueous_ = 1 μM, [ivacaftor]_membrane_ = 60 mM) and at physiological pH, ivacaftor is uncharged ([Csanády & Töröcsik, 2019](#R18)). Importantly, using thermodynamic arguments, the authors demonstrated that the concentration of free drug in solution, which is in equilibrium with that in cellular membranes cannot exceed the solubility limit of ivacaftor. Thus, under the experimental conditions employed in the present study, solutions containing ivacaftor (0.5 and 1 μM) are supersaturated, leading to supersaturation of excised membrane patches, which are in equilibrium with the ivacaftor solutions. Although precipitation of ivacaftor from supersaturated solutions is slow due to its low concentration, the octanol/water distribution coefficient of ivacaftor results in the rapid accumulation of excessive quantities of ivacaftor in excised membrane patches, predisposing to the formation of crystalline precipitates, which perturb the physicochemical properties of the membrane ([Csanády & Töröcsik, 2019](#R18)).

In the case of S1159F-CFTR and to a lesser extent S1159P-CFTR, membrane accumulation of ivacaftor likely accentuates allosteric inhibition of current flow through open channels. The location of the ivacaftor-binding site at a pivotal position within the MSDs for CFTR gating and permeation ([Liu et al., 2019](#R48); [Yeh et al., 2019](#R75)) ([Fig. 1](#F1)) provides one explanation for how the interaction of ivacaftor with S1159F might obstruct Cl^−^ flow through the channel by an allosteric mechanism. Alternatively, ivacaftor might inhibit S1159F-CFTR by interacting with a different binding site. Consistent with this idea, using photoactivatable ivacaftor probes and HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing wild-type CFTR, [Laselva et al. (2021)](#R41) localised an additional binding site for ivacaftor on intracellular loop 4 at the interface between the NBDs and MSDs. The interaction of ivacaftor with this second site might lead to allosteric inhibition of the S1159F-CFTR Cl^−^ channel. Future studies of ivacaftor’s action on *CFTR* variants should be mindful to avoid supersaturating concentrations of the drug and alert to the possibility that it might inhibit the channel under some experimental conditions.

In conclusion, the pore-lining residue S1159 in M12 is the site of two rare *CFTR* variants with similar molecular mechanisms of CFTR dysfunction but distinct responses to ivacaftor. S1159F and S1159P principally diminish CFTR function by gravely impeding ATP-dependent channel gating with S1159F causing the greater adverse effect consistent with its more severe clinical phenotype ([Table 1](#T1)) ([https://cftr2.org/](https://cftr2.org/)). Together with their impacts on the trafficking of CFTR protein to the plasma membrane and current flow through open channels, the combinatorial classification of the S1159-*CFTR* variants is class II-III ([Veit et al., 2016](#R68)), a theratype requiring a combination of CFTR correctors and potentiators to restore channel function. However, the failure of physiologically relevant ivacaftor concentrations to confer the *P*_o_ of wild-type CFTR on S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR argues that multiple correctors and potentiators will likely be required for optimal treatment of people with CF and S1159-*CFTR* variants using CFTR-targeted therapeutics. Thus, this study illustrates the importance of detailed investigations of CFTR function and pharmacology to understand the causes of phenotypic differences between individual *CFTR* variants.
