## Abstract

There is a known genetic susceptibility to anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors, but this has not been adequately shown in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. Our aim was to determine if the previously identified variants associated with cardiac dysfunction in childhood cancer patients affect AYA cancer patients similarly. Forty-five variants were selected for analysis in 253 AYAs previously treated with anthracyclines. We identified four variants that were associated with cardiac dysfunction: SLC10A2:rs7319981 (p=0.017), SLC22A17:rs4982753 (p=0.019), HAS3:rs2232228 (p=0.023), and RARG:rs2229774 (p=0.050). HAS3:rs2232228 and SLC10A2:rs7319981 displayed significant effects in our AYA cancer survivor population that were in the opposite direction than that reported in childhood cancer survivors. Genetic variants in the host genes were further analyzed for additional associations with cardiotoxicity in AYA cancer survivors. The host genes were then evaluated in a panel of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to assess changes in levels of expression when treated with doxorubicin. Significant upregulation of HAS3 and SLC22A17 expression was observed (p<0.05), with non-significant anthracycline-responsivity observed for RARG. Our study demonstrates that there is a genetic influence on cardiac dysfunction in AYA cancer patients, but there may be a difference in the role of genetics between childhood and AYA cancer survivors.

## Introduction

Cardiovascular dysfunction is a pressing concern for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors, defined as those diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15–39. At just two years follow-up, AYA survivors have at least a two-fold increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) than matched counterparts without cancer [[1](#R1)]. It is known that anthracycline exposure increases risk of cardiotoxicity, with cardiac biopsies revealing evidence of cardiac damage only hours after administration of anthracycline treatment [[2](#R2), [3](#R3)]. Furthermore, this relationship appears to be dose-dependent [[2](#R2)]. However, symptoms may still take years to manifest, and the risk of clinical cardiac dysfunction increases over time, with many patients experiencing effects long after their treatment has ended [[4](#R4)]. Long-term cardiac dysfunction contributes to an increased risk of death due to heart disease in AYA survivors compared to the general population, as well as childhood cancer survivors [[5](#R5)]. Yet, there is continued use of these cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents because of their great success in cancer control [[6](#R6)]. Anthracyclines are used as part of the chemotherapy regimen for many common AYA cancer types, but there is particularly high use in patients diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and sarcoma. This has contributed to the increased survival rates over the past decades and consequently, these groups also experience significant long-term morbidity and mortality due to cardiac dysfunction [[7](#R7)].

Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is highly dose-dependent, but dosage does not fully predict those that will develop this major late-effect. Genetic factors have been postulated to contribute to individual variation in risk of cardiotoxicity, and analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines exposed to anthracyclines suggested that up to 20–60% of observed cytotoxicity is dependent upon genetic components [[8](#R8)]. Several groups have taken a pharmacogenetic, candidate gene-based approach towards the identification of potential genetic-predictors in childhood cancer patients of European descent [[9](#R9)–[20](#R20)]. Visscher et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of only two variants could significantly improve risk prediction in childhood cancer survivors beyond clinical features, underscoring the potential impact of these variants as biomarkers [[19](#R19)]. Genome-wide association studies have also been conducted, identifying several variants in genes beyond the canonical anthracycline drug action pathway [[21](#R21), [22](#R22)].

However, these genetic studies have often focused on childhood cancer survivors, not on AYA survivors. Developing hearts in children are different than hearts in AYAs in terms of size and output. AYA hearts also have aging-related exposures and changes that contribute further complexity in understanding changes in cardiac function compared to children. Given that these two patient populations are distinct in many attributes [[23](#R23)–[25](#R25)], there is need to establish if there is a difference in the role that genetics play in cardiac dysfunction due to anthracyclines between childhood and AYA cancer survivors.

The aim of our study was to determine if variants previously identified to be associated with cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer survivors would be similarly associated in AYA cancer survivors. We genotyped 253 AYA cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines and seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) to test for potential associations between clinical and subclinical signs of cardiac dysfunction with these variants. To directly compare the findings from our AYA cancer survivor population and the previously reported findings in childhood cancer survivors, the variants were analyzed under the same genetic association parameters as reported in the initial publications. Additionally, we treated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) cell lines with doxorubicin, the most commonly used anthracycline in this age group, to assess anthracycline-response in the target tissue and provide a potential biological basis for the observed associations.

## Methods

### Study population

Study participants (N=253) included AYA cancer patients aged 15–39 at diagnosis and seen at MDACC between the years 2000 and 2016. Further inclusion criteria included patients who were: 1) alive ≥2 years post diagnosis; 2) treated with a chemotherapy regimen that included an anthracycline; and 3) diagnosed with either HL or sarcoma. We further restricted to white, European-descent participants due to the limited numbers of individuals from other racial/ethnic groups. All participants had biospecimens banked at MDACC.

### Ethics statement

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of MDACC and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. All methods and analyses were carried out in accordance with this approval.

### Clinical data collection

Clinical data was abstracted from the medical record and included variables related to demographics, cancer diagnosis, treatments received (including cumulative dose), and cardiovascular health (disease diagnosis, cardiac medications, echocardiogram measurements). Cases were defined as patients who met any of the following three criteria: 1) diagnosed with CVD, including coronary artery disease, pericardial effusion, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pericarditis, valvular heart disease, arrhythmia, angina pectoris, and/or cardiomyopathy; 2) two recorded low left ventricle ejection fractions (LVEF≤50%); 3) on cardiac medications, excluding patients that were prescribed medications to exclusively treat hypertension or hyperlipidemia.

### Genotyping

Germline DNA was extracted following standard protocols. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Global Screening Array (GSAv2.0; San Diego, CA, USA) following standard procedures in MDACC’s Population Genomics Core facility. QC was conducted based on existing metrics for sample and variant missingness and inclusion of replicate samples. Imputation of the dataset was performed using the Michigan Imputation Server based on the HRC reference panel (GRCh37) [[26](#R26)]. The 45 previously reported cardiotoxicity variants from the childhood cancer survivor population were extracted from the AYA cancer survivors genotyping dataset for further analysis. Of these 45 variants, *CRB3*:rs1056892 was not genotyped or imputed in the dataset and thus not available for analysis. Of the 44 variants available for analysis, 31 were directly genotyped and 13 were imputed. The imputation of these variants was >0.9, with the exception of *CELF4*:rs1786814 (R^2^=0.77) and *SLC28A1*:rs2305364 (R^2^=0.75). Both of these variants were dropped from further analysis resulting in 42 variants included in the final dataset.

### Statistical analysis

Student’s t-tests or chi-squared tests were used to compare the characteristics of the case and control populations. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each variant were calculated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression that included adjustment for anthracycline dose (<300 vs ≥300 mg/m^2^), radiation (yes/no), age at diagnosis, gender, years of follow up, and cancer type. In the logistic regression model under the genetic variant was assessed using the exact genetic model and risk-conferring allele as previously published. Anthracycline dose of 300 mg/m^2^ was used as the cutoff based on the mean anthracycline dose for our patient population of 304.6 mg/m^2^. Variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01 within the genes of significance (+/−10Kb) were also analyzed for significance with cardiotoxicity and the LDlink module, LDassoc, was used to plot variants across the gene using the CEF (European-descent) reference population [[27](#R27), [28](#R28)].

### iPSC-CM culturing and exposure to doxorubicin

Three iPSC-CM cell lines generated from healthy individuals aged less than 39 years at time of donation were obtained from Cellular Dynamics (Madison, WI, USA). Frozen cells were thawed, plated, and cultured following the iCell Cardiomyocytes protocol. Following observance of synchronous beating, cells were treated with doxorubicin (150 and 300 nM) or left untreated as a control. On day 2 post-treatment, cells were harvested, and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). RNA quantification and integrity was evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. RNAseq was performed using the Seq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina) on a HiSeq4000 with paired-end reads. The quality control was assessed by RSeQC metrics [[29](#R29)]. Mapping of the raw sequencing reads to the reference genome GRCh37 was conducted using STAR [[30](#R30), [31](#R31)] with GenomicAlignments [[32](#R32)] used to generate the read count matrix. DESeq2 [[33](#R33)] was applied to normalize the data and generate the regularized logarithm (rlog) transformed dataset for analysis. Analysis was conducted with 150 nM and 300 nM (exposed) samples compared to day 0 and day 2 controls (unexposed) across the three cell lines.

## Results

### Patient Population

Of the 253 AYA cancer survivors included in the analysis, 46 (18.0%) met the criteria for cardiac dysfunction ([Table 1](#T1)). The majority of patients were diagnosed with HL (71.1%) compared to sarcoma (28.9%), but there is a statistically significant difference with regard to cardiac dysfunction, with enrichment in sarcoma patients (43.5%, p=0.016). Sarcoma patients classically receive higher doses of anthracyclines compared to HL patients. In this population, the average anthracycline dose in sarcoma patients was 427.2 mg/m^2^ (range: 60–1,105 mg/m^2^) for sarcoma patients and 253.9 mg/m^2^ (range: 75–400 mg/m^2^) in HL patients. There was no difference in age at diagnosis between cases and controls with a mean age of 26.3 and 26.5, respectively. Mean length of follow up also did not differ, which was 7.1 years for cases and 6.3 years for controls. As expected, anthracycline dose was highly associated with cardiac dysfunction (p=0.00090). Average anthracycline dose among cases was 366.7 mg/m^2^ and 291.2 mg/m^2^ for controls. Radiation therapy was also significantly associated with cardiac dysfunction (p=0.022). Approximately 50% of the study population received radiation therapy, with 75% of that population having exposure to the chest.

### Cardiac Dysfunction Risk Variants

Of the 42 variants previously identified as susceptibility loci in childhood cancer survivors with data available for analysis ([Supplemental Table 1](#SD1)), four of these variants were statistically significant (p<0.05) for risk of cardiac dysfunction in AYA cancer survivors when analyzed under the same genetic models ([Table 2](#T2)). *SLC10A2*:rs7319981 was significantly associated under the additive model. The risk allele, A, conferred a 1.8-fold increased risk in cardiac dysfunction (95% CI: 1.1–3.1, p=0.017). *SLC22A17*:rs4982753 was significant with a reduction in risk (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25–0.88, p=0.019). *HAS3*:rs2232228 was significantly associated with decreased risk of cardiac dysfunction (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07–0.82, p=0.023) based on the originally reported model of the AA (common) genotype conferring risk among those who received high-dose anthracyclines. Finally, the *RARG*:rs2229774 A allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiotoxicity (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.0–4.0, p=0.050). Surprisingly, *HAS3*:rs2232228 and *SLC10A2*:rs7319981 displayed significant effects in our AYA cancer survivor population that were in the opposite direction as that reported in childhood cancer survivors. Verification of allele frequencies in dbSNP and definition of risk allele confirmed this effect directionality difference between our AYA results and the previously published children cancer survivor results.

### Gene analysis

To begin to clarify genetic architecture around these cardiotoxicity susceptibility loci in the AYA population and potentially provide insight into the differences in directionality of effect for *HAS3*:rs2232228 and *SLC10A2*:rs7319981, genetic variation within +/− 10kb of these genes were analyzed for cardiotoxicity risk ([Figure 1](#F1)). For *HAS3*, no other loci were significant for cardiotoxicity within this gene, suggesting that rs223228 is the primary driver of the association in both AYA and childhood cancer survivors – although with different effects in these two populations. However, for *SLC10A2*, there are genetic variants with low/moderate linkage disequilibrium with the query variants that could be potential causal variants in AYAs compared to childhood cancer survivors and may also be contributing to the differences in directionality that were observed for *SLC10A2*:rs7319981.

### Gene expression in iPSC-CMs

*HAS3* and *SLC22A17* expression levels were significantly upregulated following exposure to doxorubicin in the iPSC-CMs, suggesting that these genes are anthracycline responsive in the human heart ([Figure 2](#F2)). A non-significant decrease in *RARG* expression in response to doxorubicin was observed. Expression of *SLC10A2* was not detected in this cell line model system (data not shown).

## Discussion

AYA cancer patients, particularly those diagnosed with HL and sarcomas, frequently receive anthracyclines as part of their chemotherapy regimens [[34](#R34)]. Anthracyclines are known to cause cardiac dysfunction in a subset of AYA patients, however, we lack precise tools to identify patients at highest risk for long-term cardiovascular morbidity and early mortality. It has been established that there is a genetic component influencing which patients experience cardiac dysfunction and studies have identified several germline genetic variants that are associated with cardiotoxicity [[1](#R1), [35](#R35)]. Yet, with a majority of these studies being in childhood cancer populations, we set out to test the relationship between 45 variants that were previously associated with cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer survivors with cardiac dysfunction in an AYA cancer survivor population. Of the 42 variants available for analysis, we found that only four of these variants were also significant in the AYA population highlighting the difference in genetic factors for cardiac dysfunction between AYA and childhood cancer survivors. Furthermore, two of the significant variants had effects in the opposite direction compared to the original report. The true impact of these two variants on cardiotoxicity remain unclear.

*HAS3*:rs2232228 was previously identified in a cardiology-focused candidate gene study [[20](#R20)]. In that study, the AA genotype (allele frequency of 0.58) was not significant across all doses of anthracyclines or in patients who received less than 250 mg/m^2^, but a gene-treatment effect was observed for childhood cancer survivors who carried the AA genotype with a significant increase in risk compared to the rare GG genotype for individuals exposed to high-dose anthracyclines (>250 mg/m^2^). In contrast, the common AA genotype decreased risk of cardiac dysfunction compared to the GG genotypes under the same model in our AYA cancer survivor population. Analysis of other genetic variation in our population within this gene suggests that rs2232228 is the primary driver of risk in AYA cancer survivors ([Figure 1](#F1)). As a candidate gene, *HAS3* is an attractive target. It encodes for an enzyme that produces low-molecular-weight hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix that provides support for cell migration and adhesion after injury [[36](#R36)]. In relation to cardiomyocyte damage following anthracycline exposure, this gene has been reported to play a role in reducing damage caused to cardiac tissue by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [[37](#R37)]. The development of ROS by anthracyclines is one of the anti-tumor properties of the drug, yet in the cardiomyocyte the production of ROS is particularly damaging [[38](#R38)]. In the setting of heart failure, there is also an increased production of ROS, leading to mitochondrial permeability and permanent injury to the mitochondria [[39](#R39)]. Additionally, we showed that in the iPSC-CMs, expression of *HAS3* significantly increased after exposure to doxorubicin, providing a direct link between drug exposure and gene function. Together, these findings suggest an important relationship between this gene and the development of cardiac dysfunction in both childhood and AYA cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines, albeit with effects in opposite directions that are not yet understood. Further fine mapping and exploration of this region in both childhood and AYA cancer survivors is warranted to clarify these relationships.

*SLC10A2*:rs7319981 was previously identified through a candidate gene approach focusing on drug biotransformation genes [[19](#R19)]. In this study, the minor allele (A) was associated with decreased risk of cardiotoxicity under the additive model, with cases being defined as having a shortening fraction (SF) less than 26%, and controls having SF≥30%. In our AYA study population, the A allele conferred the opposite risk to patients with a comparable effect size in the additive model. Several variants located in proximity to rs731998 were also nominally significant for cardiotoxicity in our study population ([Figure 1](#F1)). However, a cluster of variants within *SLC10A2* were identified in our analysis of AYA cancer survivors that were more significantly associated with cardiotoxicity risk. This suggests that rs731998 may not be the sole mediator of cardiotoxicity risk in AYA cancer survivors. The metrics used to define cases in our study are different from what was used in Visscher et. al., however, the consistency of the effect size (approximately double) regardless of directionality suggests that this gene is playing an important role in anthracycline response.

*SLC22A17*:rs4982753 was previously identified as a variant associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity defined by patients’ SF and/or symptoms from cardiotoxicity that required treatment [[18](#R18)]. The effect of rs4982753 was consistent in both analyses focusing on AYA and childhood cancer survivors. The T allele (allele frequency of 0.26) is associated with a significant 50% decrease in cardiotoxicity risk. We also observed significantly increased expression of *SLC22A17* after exposure to doxorubicin in the iPSC-CM model system. The similarity between the results in AYA and childhood cancer survivors coupled with the anthracycline-responsive nature of *SLC22A17* in iPSC-CMs provides robust support of the impact of *SLC22A17*:rs4982753 on cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines.

The retinoid acid receptor gamma (*RARG*) variant, rs2229774, was identified in a GWAS analysis with extensive validation [[21](#R21)]. *RARG* is a member of the retinoic acid receptor family that functions as transcription factors with roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and homeostasis [[40](#R40), [41](#R41)]. The variant results in a serine to lysine substitution and laboratory studies have demonstrated that the S427L change alters RARG’s response to anthracycline exposure [[42](#R42)–[45](#R45)]. iPSC-CMs with the variant allele have decreased cell viability, increased DNA damage and double strand breaks, and increased ROS generation. When isogenic iPSC-CM lines were generated with the common allele, there was a recovery of this anthracycline-sensitive phenotype [[43](#R43), [44](#R44)]. Further studies have shown that RARG is involved in regulation of TOP2B (topoisomerase 2 beta) in the heart [[43](#R43)–[45](#R45)] – a known cardiotoxicity mechanism [[46](#R46)]. The findings in our AYA cancer survivor population provide further support for the importance of this variant and *RARG* in susceptibility to cardiotoxicity following anthracycline-based treatment.

As noted above, of the four statistically significant variants identified in this study, two of these loci were found to have effects in the opposite direction in our AYA cancer survivors as to what was observed in the original discovery studies in childhood cancer survivors. Several approaches were taken to verify that this change in directionality was not due to differences in definition of risk allele. First, we verified allele frequencies across all studies with those reported in dbGAP for individuals of European ancestry. Allele frequencies in the previous studies and this current study were comparable. Finally, we conducted a fine-mapping approach in our AYA cancer survivor dataset to potentially identify variants in low/moderate linkage disequilibrium that may be contributing to the different effect in AYAs. For *SLC10A2,* other genetic variants are more strongly associated with cardiotoxicity risk compared to the query variant identified in childhood cancer survivors.

The differences in allelic effects for these loci between the previous studies and our current analysis is intriguing. It has been well-established that AYA cancer patients are unique from both childhood and adult cancer patients. They differ by their cancer biology, cancer types, survival rates, response to therapy, and pharmacokinetic properties [[24](#R24)]. With regards to toxicities and late-effects due to treatment exposures, the body composition of AYAs differs significantly from children. These physical changes result in effects on drug disposition [[47](#R47)]. In general, AYAs experience drastic changes in height, weight, body composition, and fat proportions during this age period. These changes contribute to differences in volume of distribution and clearance which impact efficacy of cancer treatments and levels of acute toxicity [[24](#R24)]. Additionally, the organs involved in metabolism of cancer drugs are also changing in size and maturity. This growth would also apply to the heart. Because of these dramatic differences in the AYA cancer population, the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines state “AYA patients with cancer should be recognized as a distinct population that has unique medical and psychosocial needs.” All of this only begins to highlight the importance of studying the AYA cancer patient population as a unique group of cancer survivors. These differences may begin to explain why some cardiotoxicity risk loci in childhood cancer survivors have an opposite effect in the AYA population, and may also suggest why many of the variants identified in the childhood population were not significantly associated with risk in the AYA cancer survivor population. However, additional studies in larger populations of survivors of AYA cancer are necessary to understand the spectrum of genetic risk factors for cardiac dysfunction and how that compares with susceptibility loci in childhood cancer survivors.

Our study has many strengths. First, it is unique in that it looks specifically at the AYA cancer survivor population that are at least 2 years post-diagnosis. With our inclusion criteria focusing on patients diagnosed between 2000–2016, we have follow-up time for the development of cardiac dysfunction. However, many cardiac adverse events do not manifest until decades post treatment and an increase in events over time with continued follow-up may be necessary to fully elucidate the differences in genetic risk between AYA and childhood cancer survivors. The lack of guidelines for screening of cardiac function in survivors of AYA cancer, in contrast to childhood cancer survivors, is a further challenge. A portion of survivors with AYA cancer may be experiencing cardiac dysfunction that would remain undetected without an echocardiogram at regular intervals. Our definition of cardiac dysfunction was designed to be comprehensive incorporating cardiovascular disease diagnoses, cardiac medication use, and echocardiogram measures as a step to minimize this concern. Further, our study was limited to patients who were diagnosed with either HL or a sarcoma, AYA cancers that are frequently treated with anthracyclines. Future studies would benefit from focusing on additional cancer types within the AYA population exposed to anthracyclines to determine if these genetic variants identified in our studies are specific for HL and sarcoma or if they impact cardiac dysfunction more broadly. Our analysis included radiation treatment as a potential confounder recognizing the cardiotoxic nature of this treatment modality. Deeper exploration of the specific exposure to the heart would potentially provide further clarity regarding the relationship between genetic variation, treatment, and cardiotoxicity in AYA cancer patients. The advantage of this single institution, hospital-based population is the availability of detailed treatment, echocardiographic, and follow-up data on our patients. It is acknowledged that the patients seen at MDACC for cancer treatment may not be fully representative of those in the general cancer patient population due it being a tertiary cancer hospital. To account for the potential effect of population stratification in the genetic analyses, the study was focused on non-Hispanic white patients. However, the studies of childhood cancer patients that served as the discovery for this analysis were also nearly exclusive to non-Hispanic white patients. Future studies would be of interest in a more diverse AYA cancer survivor population. Additionally, the definition of cardiac dysfunction or cardiotoxicity is highly variable across studies. We chose a comprehensive approach in establishing the definition of cardiac dysfunction that incorporates echocardiographic changes, diagnosis of CVD, and also accounts for patients who are being treated with cardiac medications due to the development symptoms or early changes in their echocardiograms, and thus would not have a significant drop in their LVEF or develop CVD. The variability in definition of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity or cardiac dysfunction across studies is a challenge [[48](#R48), [49](#R49)]. Our understanding of the impact of these genetic variants on cardiovascular function would be enhanced with a prospective, standardized follow-up in survivors of AYA cancer to enable time-to-event analyses.

In conclusion, our study analyzed the effects of previously identified variants associated with cardiac dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors in a cohort of AYA cancer survivors. Four of the 42 cardiotoxicity-susceptibility variants analyzed were significantly associated with cardiac dysfunction in our AYA cancer survivor population, suggesting that the spectrum of genetic risk is different for anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction in the AYA population compared to childhood cancer survivors. Further discovery studies are needed to identify additional variants that are uniquely associated with cardiac dysfunction in this understudied population. Our study highlights the importance of evaluating AYA patients as an independent population of cancer survivors and identifying the unique genetic factors that impact cardiac function in these patients to improve risk prediction.
