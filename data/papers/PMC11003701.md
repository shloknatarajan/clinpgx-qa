## Abstract

**Background:** 
Escitalopram and sertraline are commonly prescribed for anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of these medications have been evaluated in adults and demonstrate extensive variability, but studies in pediatric patients are limited. Therefore, we performed a population PK analysis for escitalopram and sertraline in children and adolescents to characterize the effects of demographic, clinical, and pharmacogenetic factors on drug exposure.

**Methods:** 
A PK dataset was generated by extracting data from the electronic health record and opportunistic sampling of escitalopram- and sertraline-treated psychiatrically-hospitalized pediatric patients aged 5 to 18 years. A population PK analysis of escitalopram and sertraline was performed using NONMEM. Concentration-time profiles were simulated using MwPharm++ to evaluate how covariates included in the final models influence medication exposure and compared to adult therapeutic reference ranges.

**Results:** 
The final escitalopram cohort consisted of 315 samples from 288 patients, and the sertraline cohort consisted of 265 samples from 255 patients. A one-compartment model with a proportional residual error model best described the data for both medications. For escitalopram, CYP2C19 phenotype and concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitors affected apparent clearance (CL/F), and normalizing CL/F and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) to body surface area (BSA) improved estimations. The final escitalopram model estimated CL/F and V/F at 14.2 L/h/1.73m2 and 428 L/1.73m2, respectively. For sertraline, CYP2C19 phenotype and concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitors influenced CL/F, and empirical allometric scaling of patient body weight on CL/F and V/F was significant. The final sertraline model estimated CL/F and V/F at 124 L/h/70kg and 4320 L/70kg, respectively. Normalized trough concentrations (Ctrough) for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers taking escitalopram were 3.98-fold higher compared to normal metabolizers (151.1 ng/mL vs 38.0 ng/mL, p<0.0001), and normalized Ctrough for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers taking sertraline were 3.23-fold higher compared to normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers combined (121.7 ng/mL vs 37.68 ng/mL, p<0.0001). Escitalopram- and sertraline-treated poor metabolizers may benefit from a dose reduction of 50-75% and 25-50%, respectively, to normalize exposure to other phenotypes.

**Conclusion:** 
To our knowledge, this is the largest population PK analysis of escitalopram and sertraline in pediatric patients. Significant PK variability for both medications was observed and was largely explained by CYP2C19 phenotype. Slower CYP2C19 metabolizers taking escitalopram or sertraline may benefit from dose reductions given increased exposure.

## 1. Introduction

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) escitalopram and sertraline are commonly prescribed first-line treatments for anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents [[1](#R1),[2](#R2)]. While substantial evidence demonstrating their efficacy and tolerability in youth is available, there is still significant variability in patient response and tolerability [[3](#R3)]. Additionally, there is extensive inter-individual variability (IIV) in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of both of these medications that could relate to differences in treatment outcomes [[4](#R4),[5](#R5)].

Escitalopram and sertraline metabolism is mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. For escitalopram, metabolism is catalyzed primarily by CYP2C19 and secondarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 [[6](#R6)]. Similarly, sertraline is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19, as well as CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 [[7](#R7)]. Variants in *CYP2C19* significantly influence escitalopram and sertraline PK [[8](#R8)]. The combination of *CYP2C19* alleles corresponds with phenotypic classification as either a poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, normal metabolizer, rapid metabolizer, or ultrarapid metabolizer [[9](#R9)]. In adults, slower CYP2C19 metabolizers have elevated escitalopram and sertraline exposure compared to normal metabolizers, whereas faster CYP2C19 metabolizers have decreased exposure [[10](#R10)-[16](#R16)]. While these relative effects in adults may be similar to adolescents, children may have increased enzymatic activity related to differences in CYP ontogeny [[17](#R17),[18](#R18)]. Nevertheless, adult and pediatric patients are reported to have similar PK of escitalopram [[19](#R19)-[21](#R21)] and sertraline [[22](#R22)-[25](#R25)]. However, the sample sizes of these studies in pediatric populations are small, and sertraline exposure in children and adolescents is 22% lower after adjusting plasma concentrations for weight compared to adults [[22](#R22)]. Additionally, the clearance of other CYP2C19-metabolized medications (e.g., voriconazole) are faster in children relative to adults [[26](#R26),[27](#R27)].

Recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring and dosing are available for escitalopram and sertraline, but are based on studies in adults and may not be generalizable to pediatric populations. Specifically, consensus guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of psychotropic medications are available and provide population-level therapeutic reference ranges corresponding to the range of trough concentrations that increase the likelihood of achieving response while minimizing tolerability risk for adults [[28](#R28)]. For escitalopram, the recommended therapeutic reference range is 15 to 80 ng/mL, whereas sertraline is 10 to 150 ng/mL. Similarly, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) recommends dosing escitalopram and sertraline based on CYP2C19 phenotype, specifically reducing the initial dose, using slower titration, and a 50% reduction in the standard maintenance dose in poor metabolizers [[29](#R29)]. However, CPIC advises close monitoring when extrapolating these recommendations [[8](#R8)]. Understanding how these recommendations may differ in children and adolescents will be important when applying model-informed precision dosing to pediatric populations, especially considering potential differences in PK and tolerability profiles compared to adults [[30](#R30)].

The objectives of this study were to develop a population PK model for escitalopram and sertraline in pediatric patients and assess the impact of covariates on PK and drug exposure. This study utilizes opportunistic sampling of remnant clinical samples and data from the electronic health record (EHR) [[31](#R31),[32](#R32)].

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Patient Population

Pediatric patients (aged ≤18 years) admitted to the inpatient psychiatric service at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) who underwent pharmacogenetic testing and were prescribed either escitalopram or sertraline between 2019 and 2022 were eligible. Patient data were excluded from analysis if medication adherence was unknown or if the patient missed the dose prior to the sample collection. Medication adherence and non-adherence were determined by manual review of clinical notes. Cases where non-adherence was noted, but not explicitly stated (e.g., patient-reported missing doses, but it was unclear when or how many were missed prior to sample collection), were excluded (n=16). No exclusions were made based on prior medication use or diagnosis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at CCHMC.

### 2.2. Data Collection

Demographic, clinical, and pharmacogenetic data were extracted from the EHR, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnoses, height, weight, *CYP2C19* and *CYP2D6* genotypes and phenotypes, blood specimen sampling time, use of marijuana or cannabidiol (CBD), and use of concomitant CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 strong or moderate inhibitors (e.g., esomeprazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ketoconazole, omeprazole, oral contraceptives, voriconazole, bupropion, chlorpromazine, doxepin, duloxetine, hydroxyzine, metoclopramide, moclobemide, paroxetine, quinidine, and terbinafine) [[33](#R33)] within three days prior to the plasma sample collection date. These data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at CCHMC [[34](#R34),[35](#R35)]. Marijuana use was determined through the drugs of abuse screen for cannabinoids, and the use of CBD was determined through a manual review of clinical notes. The dosing history for each patient was determined based on medication administration records, prescription orders, and clinical notes. Specifically, medication administration records from the EHR provided the date and time when patients were dosed during the inpatient encounter, and dosing prior to admission was determined via prescription orders and clinical notes, which provided information related to the typical dosage time, interval, and any adherence concerns. The height values for three patients taking escitalopram were imputed based on the median population value of their respective sex because it was not measured during the clinical encounter. Information related to nicotine use and smoking were not extracted because previous studies have demonstrated no significant effect on escitalopram or sertraline pharmacokinetics [[36](#R36),[37](#R37)]. However, one study demonstrated lower dose-corrected escitalopram serum concentration in smokers than nonsmokers, but it did not account for CYP2C19 phenotype [[38](#R38)].

### 2.3. CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 Genotyping

Pharmacogenetic testing for *CYP2C19* and *CYP2D6* was performed as part of routine clinical care at CCHMC. Genomic DNA was isolated from either whole blood or buccal swab samples during a patient’s first psychiatric hospitalization. Specimens were sent to the CCHMC Genetics and Genomics Diagnostic Laboratory for genotyping. A TaqMan low-density array (Applied Biosystems, Forest City, CA) and long-range polymerase chain reaction testing for duplication was used for genotyping from 2013 to 2019, and a MassARRAY system (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA) was used thereafter [[39](#R39),[40](#R40)]. Eight alleles were assessed for *CYP2C19*, including seven no function alleles (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, and *8) and the increased function allele (*17). For *CYP2D6*, 21 alleles were assessed from 2013 to 2019, and this was expanded to 26 alleles in 2019, in addition to detecting allelic duplication by long-range PCR or the VeriDose CYP2D6 CNV panel [[39](#R39)]. A *1 genotype was inferred from the absence of the variant alleles. Genotype predicted phenotype interpretations were made using CPIC guidelines to classify patients as poor, intermediate, normal, rapid, or ultrarapid CYP2C19 metabolizers, as well as poor, intermediate, normal, or ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers [[8](#R8),[9](#R9),[29](#R29),[41](#R41)]. Each patient’s pharmacogenetic information, including genotypes and phenotypes, was uploaded to the EHR.

### 2.4. Sample Collection and Concentration Analysis

An alert system was implemented using the VigiLanz clinical surveillance platform to send a notification when a blood specimen was obtained within 24 hours of a patient being administered escitalopram or sertraline. These blood specimens were collected to perform complete blood count tests as part of routine clinical care and were not collected with the initial intent of performing therapeutic drug monitoring. After clinical testing was complete, we obtained the remaining or remnant samples through the CCHMC Clinical Laboratories. Plasma was retrieved from the remnant samples and stored at −80°C until sample processing for drug concentration analysis. Escitalopram and sertraline concentrations were determined using validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods detailed in the [Supplementary Information](#SD1). The lower limit of quantification for escitalopram was 0.03 ng/mL using 100 μL of plasma, and the lower limit of quantification for sertraline was 0.1 ng/mL using 100 μL of plasma.

### 2.5. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis

For escitalopram and sertraline, a population pharmacokinetic analysis using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed using NONMEM (version 7.5, ICON Software Development, Ellicott City, MD). Model development and analysis were facilitated by the Pirana Modeling Workbench (version 3.0.0) and Perl-speaks-NONMEM (version 5.2.6). A base model was initially developed by comparing one-compartment models without covariates with additive, proportional, and combined residual error model structures. An exponential model was used to evaluate the IIV for PK parameters, where deviations of the individual from the population parameter values were assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of ω^2^. An exponential model was used to ensure the parameters remained positive [[42](#R42),[43](#R43)]. The first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCE-I) method was used to estimate population parameters, including apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F), and absorption rate constant (K_a_). Sampling for both drugs was limited in the hours following the last administration, and the absorption phases were not able to be adequately described. Therefore, in accordance with previously published models and information regarding the absorption in the drug labels, the K_a_ was fixed to 0.8 h^−1^ for the escitalopram model [[19](#R19),[21](#R21),[44](#R44),[45](#R45)] and 0.5 h^−1^ for the sertraline model [[24](#R24),[46](#R46)].

Models were evaluated using the objective function value (OFV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Reduction in IIV, residual standard error (RSE), and model shrinkage were also considered during covariate analysis. Finally, goodness-of-fit (GOF) diagnostic plots were assessed.

Covariates were tested to evaluate whether they could explain additional IIV in estimated population parameters (e.g., CL/F, V/F). Patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, body mass index, body surface area (BSA) (calculated using the Dubois Dubois method [[47](#R47)]), CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 phenotype, concomitant use of CYP2C19 and/or CYP2D6 inhibitors, and use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (e.g., marijuana and/or CBD) were evaluated using a forward and backward stepwise covariate selection approach. Theoretical (i.e., fixed exponent value of 0.75) and empirical (i.e., parameterization) allometric scaling of body weight, as well as BSA-based allometric scaling, on CL/F and V/F were considered. Ethnicity was included in the covariate analysis because there may be differences in the prevalence of *CYP* polymorphisms in individuals who are Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic [[48](#R48),[49](#R49)]. For both models, covariates were added during forward stepwise inclusion if there was a decrease in the OFV by ≥3.84 (p<0.05). Backwards elimination of covariates were retained in the model if the OFV increased by ≥6.63 (p<0.01).

### 2.6. Modeling and Simulation of Patient Concentration-Time Profiles

The final escitalopram and sertraline models were implemented into Edsim++ and MwPharm++ (version 2.1.1.273, Mediware, Czech Republic). Bayesian estimated PK parameters and concentration-time profiles were generated for each patient. Non-normalized parameters, including patient CL/F, V/F, and half-life (t_1/2_), were extracted and compared across patients. Then, using the Bayesian estimated parameters, each patient modeled at a normalized dose (i.e., 20 mg/day and 150 mg/day at steady-state for escitalopram and sertraline, respectively) and normalized to each drug’s respective reference patient, with the exception of CYP2C19 phenotype. For escitalopram, the reference patient was an individual with normal CYP2C19 metabolism, a BSA of 1.73m^2^, and no concomitant use of a CYP2C19 inhibitor. For sertraline, the reference patient was an individual with normal CYP2C19 metabolism, a body weight of 70kg, and no concomitant use of a CYP2C19 inhibitor. Exposure (AUC_24_), maximum concentrations (C_max_), and trough concentrations (C_trough_) were extracted from MwPharm++ and compared between CYP2C19 phenotypes.

Concentration-time profiles showing a dose titration for escitalopram and sertraline were simulated. These simulations were generated by normalizing to the respective reference patient for either escitalopram or sertraline while changing the CYP2C19 phenotype to allow for comparison between phenotype profiles. Additional simulations were performed for covariates included in the final drug model for escitalopram and sertraline to assess its impact on exposure.

### 2.7. Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using *R* (version 4.2.2) and GraphPad Prism (version 9.5.0). PK parameters were natural logarithmic-transformed and evaluated using t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). *Post-hoc* analysis using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was utilized to compare PK parameters of CYP2C19 phenotypes to normal metabolizers. Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between numerical variables. Results were considered statistically significant at a 5% threshold. All figures were created using GraphPad Prism (version 9.5.0).

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Escitalopram

In total, 303 patients contributed 330 plasma samples for the escitalopram cohort. Thirteen patients were excluded because of unknown medication adherence (n=9), missed dose prior to sample collection (n=3), or missing CYP2C19 phenotype (n=1). Additionally, two patients had large conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) (i.e., CWRES>5) when building the base model; after verifying that their dosing histories were correct and the CWRES could not be explained, these patients were excluded. These patients had normal and rapid CYP2C19 phenotypes and could not be explained by inclusion of CYP2C19 in the model. The final cohort comprising 288 patients and 315 samples is described in [Table 1](#T1). Patient demographics stratified by CYP2C19 phenotypes are available in [Supplementary Table 3](#SD1). The escitalopram daily dose at the last dose prior to sample collection ranged from 1-30 mg/day. Patients taking CYP2C19 inhibitors (n=38, 13%) were taking either oral contraceptives (n=29, 10%) or fluoxetine (n=9, 3%). Patients taking fluoxetine were cross-tapering between medications.

A one-compartment model with a proportional residual error model best described the escitalopram data. For the base model, the CL/F and V/F were estimated at 13.1 L/h and 420 L, respectively. For stepwise covariate modeling, the inclusion of CYP2C19 phenotype on CL/F was the strongest covariate (ΔOFV = −52.903) and explained 6.8% of IIV in CL/F. BSA normalized to 1.73m^2^ on CL/F and V/F was the second most important covariate (ΔOFV = −26.720) and provided better estimations compared to theoretical or empirical allometrically scaled body weight-normalized models (ΔOFV = −21.472 and −8.018, respectively). Further, we observed that the coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation of clearance with BSA were better and stronger compared to body weight (R^2^=0.05 and ρ=0.22 vs R^2^=0.03 and ρ=0.18, respectively; [Supplementary Figure 1](#SD1)). Normalizing the CL/F and V/F to a BSA of 1.73m^2^ also yielded a better OFV compared to a model with only BSA-normalized CL/F (ΔOFV = −17.012). Finally, concomitant use of CYP2C19 inhibitors on CL/F improved model estimations (ΔOFV = −12.341). Since CYP2D6 phenotype did not improve estimations, the use of CYP2D6-only inhibitors were not considered. Additional covariates (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity, use of THC/CBD) did not yield additional improvements in model performance or explain additional variability in CL/F or V/F parameters. The final covariate model estimated the CL/F and V/F at 14.2 L/h/1.73m^2^ and 428 L/1.73m^2^, respectively ([Table 2](#T2)). GOF plots are presented in [Supplementary Figure 2](#SD1).

Escitalopram t_1/2_ was significantly higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers compared to other phenotypes (p<0.0001), with nearly a three-fold increase in t_1/2_ compared to normal metabolizers (60.99 h vs 21.81 h). Normalized AUC_24_, C_max_, and C_trough_ were significantly different among CYP2C19 phenotypes (p<0.0001). *Post-hoc* analysis showed these parameters for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (all p<0.0001) and intermediate metabolizers (all p<0.0001) were significantly higher compared normal metabolizers. Rapid metabolizers had significantly lower normalized C_trough_ (p=0.025), but not AUC_24_ (p=0.09) or C_max_ (p=0.22), compared to normal metabolizers. Ultrarapid metabolizers did not have significantly different normalized AUC_24_ (p=0.53), C_max_ (p=0.58), or C_trough_ (p=0.51) compared to normal metabolizers ([Table 3](#T3), [Figure 1](#F1)).

Panels d-f are dose-normalized to 20 mg/day with a body surface area of 1.73m2 and no concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitors. In panel f, the gray dashed lines represent the lower and upper therapeutic reference range of the Ctrough for adults at 15 ng/mL and 80 ng/mL, respectively, and the black dashed line represents that laboratory alert level at 160 ng/mL [28].

Greater BSA corresponded with increased CL/F and V/F of escitalopram, where for every 0.1 m^2^ increase in BSA, there was an increase in CL/F and V/F by about 5.5% (p<0.0001) and 5.9% (p<0.0001), respectively. Furthermore, while concomitant use of a CYP2C19 inhibitor reduces CL/F, there was no difference in escitalopram CL/F between patients taking either oral contraceptives (n=29) versus fluoxetine (n=9) (11.46 L/h vs 10.33 L/h, p=0.37).

[Figure 2a](#F2) shows simulated escitalopram concentration-time profiles for each CYP2C19 phenotype, where each profile was normalized to a BSA of 1.73m^2^ and no co-administration with a CYP2C19 inhibitor. Escitalopram was initiated at a dose of 5 mg/day, titrated to 10 mg/day at day 14, titrated to 15 mg/day at day 28, and titrated to 20 mg/day at day 42. Since no reference range exists for pediatric patients, C_trough_ were compared to the therapeutic reference range for adults (15-80 ng/mL) [[28](#R28)]. Poor metabolizers had C_trough_ above the upper therapeutic reference range at doses ≥10 mg/day and approached the laboratory alert level at 20 mg/day. Additionally, because of the longer t_1/2_ in poor metabolizers, steady state was not achieved within two weeks of daily treatment at each interval. Comparatively, C_trough_ for the other phenotypes are below the lower reference range at 5 mg/day. Ultrarapid metabolizers are only above the lower reference range at doses ≥15 mg/day. Patients who have a lower BSA or who are concomitantly taking a CYP2C19 inhibitor have marginal increases in C_trough_, but could still result in concentrations above or below the reference range for non-normal CYP2C19 metabolizers ([Figure 2b](#F2) & [c](#F2)).

The gray dashed lines represent the lower and upper therapeutic reference range of the Ctrough for adults at 15 ng/mL and 80 ng/mL, respectively, and the black dashed line represents that laboratory alert level at 160 ng/mL [28]. PM, poor metabolizer; IM, intermediate metabolizer; NM, normal metabolizer; RM, rapid metabolizer; UM, ultrarapid metabolizer.

### 3.2. Sertraline

A total of 265 patients were included and 276 plasma samples were obtained for the sertraline cohort. Nine patients were excluded due to unknown medication adherence (n=7), missed dose prior to sample collection (n=1), or missing CYP2C19 phenotype (n=1). Additionally, one patient had a CRWES >5 when building the base mode, but after verifying that their dosing history was correct and the CWRES could not be explained, this patient was excluded. This patient was a CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizer and could not be explained by inclusion of CYP2C19 in the model. The final cohort comprising 255 patients and 265 samples is described in [Table 1](#T1). Patient demographics stratified by CYP2C19 phenotype groups are available in [Supplementary Table 4](#SD1). The sertraline daily dose at the last dose prior to sample collection ranged from 12.5-250 mg/day. Patients taking a CYP2C19 inhibitor (n=28, 11%) were taking either oral contraceptives (n=25, 10%) or fluoxetine (n=3, 1%). Patients taking fluoxetine were cross-tapering between medications.

A one-compartment model with a proportional residual error model best described the sertraline data. The CL/F and V/F for the base model were estimated at 98.3 L/h and 5170 L, respectively. Forward stepwise covariate selection revealed CYP2C19 on CL/F as the most important covariate (ΔOFV = −68.578). The CL/F of CYP2C19 rapid metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers were not different from normal metabolizers and were not estimated in the final model. Next, empirical allometric scaling of body weight on CL/F and V/F was the second most significant covariate (ΔOFV = −18.935). The parameter for body weight on V/F was estimated at 1.01 and was fixed to 1.0 in the final model to reduce model complexity. This also provided better estimations compared to theoretical allometrically scaled body weight- or BSA-normalized models (ΔOFV = 6.582 and −12.988, respectively). Next, CYP2C19 inhibitors significantly improved CL/F estimates (ΔOFV = −11.545). Since CYP2D6 phenotype was not a significant covariate on CL/F, only the use of CYP2C19 inhibitors were considered. Finally, during the forward selection process, inclusion of sex on CL/F and V/F provided a significant decrease in OFV by −5.860, but this was not retained during the backward selection process. This inclusion also led to an increase in RSE of the IIV of V/F by 15%. The other included covariates were all retained in the backward selection process. The other tested covariates did not further improve CL/F or V/F estimates (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, use of THC/CBD). The final covariate model estimated the CL/F and V/F at 124 L/h/70kg and 4320 L/70kg, respectively ([Table 4](#T4)), and the GOF plots are available in [Supplementary Figure 3](#SD1). The final covariate model structure for CL/F is as follows:

Sertraline t_1/2_ for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers was over 2.5-fold higher compared to normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers (62.08 h vs 23.51 h, p<0.0001). Normalized AUC_24_, C_max_, and C_trough_ were significantly different among CYP2C19 phenotypes (p<0.0001), and *post-hoc* analysis revealed these parameters for poor metabolizers (all p<0.0001) and intermediate metabolizers (all p<0.0001) were significantly different from normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers ([Table 5](#T5), [Figure 3](#F3)).

Sertraline (a) clearance, (b) volume, (c) half-life, (d) AUC24, (e) Cmax, and (f) Ctrough by CYP2C19 phenotype. The line represents the median and bars represent the interquartile range. Panels d-f are dose-normalized to 150 mg/day with a body weight of 70 kg and no concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitors. For panel f, the gray dashed lines represent the lower and upper therapeutic reference range of the Ctrough for adults at 10 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL, respectively, and the black dashed line represent the laboratory alert level [28]. PM, poor metabolizer; IM, intermediate metabolizer; NM, normal metabolizer; RM, rapid metabolizer; UM, ultrarapid metabolizer; AUC24, exposure; Cmax, maximum concentration; Ctrough, trough concentration.

As a patient’s body weight increased, there was a corresponding increase in CL/F and V/F of sertraline. For every 10 kg increase in body weight, there was an increase in the CL/F and V/F of sertraline by about 4.9% (p<0.0001) and 16.1% (p<0.0001), respectively. Additionally, CL/F did not significantly differ between patients taking oral contraceptives (n=25) versus fluoxetine (n=3) (80.12 L/h vs 64.05 L/h, p=0.06). Since inclusion of sex resulted in a significant drop in OFV during the forward selection covariate process, we also tested whether normalized CL/F and V/F were significantly different between females and males, but no difference in CL/F (female = 123.1 L/h/70kg vs male = 124.5 L/h/70kg, p=0.72) or V/F (female = 4318 L/70kg vs male = 4314 L/70kg, p=0.07) was observed.

[Figure 4a](#F4) shows the simulated sertraline concentration profiles for each CYP2C19 phenotype group, where each profile was normalized to a body weight of 70 kg and no co-administration with a CYP2C19 inhibitor. Sertraline was initiated at a dose of 25 mg/day, titrated to 50 mg/day at day 14, titrated to 100 mg/day at day 28, titrated to 150 mg/day at day 42, and titrated to 200 mg/day at day 56. Therapeutic reference ranges for sertraline do not exist for the pediatric population, and so the adult reference range (10-150 ng/mL) was utilized for comparisons [[28](#R28)]. For poor metabolizers, doses of 200 mg/day were above the upper reference range, and steady-state concentrations were not achieved within two weeks of daily treatment at each interval. At a dose of 25 mg/day, simulated plasma concentrations for normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers are below the adult lower reference range. Differences in body weight has a negligible effect on C_trough_ ([Figure 4b](#F4)), whereas concomitant use of a CYP2C19 inhibitor slightly increases C_trough_ ([Figure 4c](#F4)).

## 4. Discussion

This is the largest population PK analysis of escitalopram and sertraline in children and adolescents. Further, opportunistic sampling and leveraging EHR data to obtain administration data and relevant covariates allowed more comprehensive PK datasets to be generated. Escitalopram and sertraline PK in pediatric patients were influenced by a surfeit of factors (e.g., CYP2C19 phenotype, BSA, body weight, CYP2C19 inhibitors) that have been observed in escitalopram- or sertraline-treated adults. However, these factors had, heretofore, not been systematically evaluated in youth. Additionally, clinicians treating children and adolescents with SSRIs frequently titrate medications in patients with partial response, yet dose-response relationships for SSRIs in youth are inscrutable. Meta-analyses of dose-response relationships for SSRIs in youth have produced conflicting results for obsessive-compulsive disorder [[50](#R50)], major depressive disorder [[51](#R51)], and anxiety disorders [[52](#R52)]. These data, which reveal substantial variation in sertraline and escitalopram PK, could explain the conflicting findings that result from examining dose rather than exposure.

### 4.1. Escitalopram

Compared to previous adult and adolescent PK models and analyses, the estimated population CL/F and V/F of escitalopram were lower. This is unexpected considering escitalopram PK in adolescents are reportedly similar to adults [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)]. In fact, reported CL/F and V/F estimates for adults and adolescents range from 20-40 L/h and 800-1200 L, respectively [[19](#R19)-[21](#R21),[36](#R36),[44](#R44),[53](#R53),[54](#R54)]. One model from patients aged 12 to 83 years that employed a sparse sampling strategy reported the CL/F of adolescents aged 15 years to be 20.83 L/h; however, this study reported a similarly low population CL/F of 16.3 L/h [[36](#R36)]. This lower CL/F could relate to opportunistic sampling or limited information regarding dosing times prior to admission [[36](#R36),[53](#R53)]. Nevertheless, significant variability in CL/F between patients was observed, ranging from 3.51 L/h to 46.3 L/h.

Consistent with previous population PK analyses, a patient’s CYP2C19 phenotype significantly explained variability in escitalopram CL/F [[10](#R10),[21](#R21),[36](#R36),[54](#R54),[55](#R55)]. On average, poor and intermediate metabolizers had 69% and 20% slower CL/F relative to normal metabolizers, respectively, whereas rapid and ultrarapid metabolizers had 18% and 23% faster CL/F, respectively. Although prior population PK analyses grouped CYP2C19 phenotypes (e.g., poor+intermediate metabolizers vs normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers) [[54](#R54),[55](#R55)] due to small sample sizes, our findings suggest that CL/F differs between all phenotypes, which has been previously suggested for escitalopram ([Table 3](#T3), [Figure 1a](#F1)) [[13](#R13),[15](#R15)].

Normalizing the CL/F and V/F to a BSA of 1.73m^2^ improved model estimates, which contrasts other models that incorporated body weight and body mass index on CL/F and V/F, but still shows the expected linear effect of faster clearance as body size increases [[54](#R54),[55](#R55)]. Finally, concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitors reduced CL/F by 25% compared to patients who were not taking an inhibitor, which supports research showing fluoxetine and oral contraceptives inhibit CYP2C19 [[56](#R56)-[59](#R59)]. This is also consistent with studies that observed decreases in escitalopram CL/F by 19% in patients treated with a CYP2C19 inhibitor (e.g., esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole) [[44](#R44)].

Aside from BSA and concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitor use, other demographic and clinical factors (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity, CYP2D6 phenotype, THC/CBD use) did not impact escitalopram PK. Consistent with prior studies, we did not observe sex differences in escitalopram PK [[21](#R21),[44](#R44),[54](#R54),[55](#R55)]. Additionally, although the effect of age on CL/F has been reported, this was not found in this study, likely due to this population encompassing patients aged 10-18 years old [[36](#R36),[54](#R54),[55](#R55)]. Use of THC or CBD did not influence escitalopram PK despite models suggesting that both THC and CBD inhibit CYP2C19 [[60](#R60),[61](#R61)]. Our inability to detect an effect may be related to the limited number of patients taking CBD and variation in THC dose across cannabis formulations, variation in the frequency and route of administration, or uncertainty in reported use as determined from the clinician notes when drug screening was not performed.

### 4.2. Sertraline

The estimated population CL/F was similar to values reported for adults and adolescents (e.g., 115-175 L/h for a 70 kg individual) [[23](#R23),[62](#R62),[63](#R63)], although it was faster compared to initial reports in adults (e.g., 94.5-98.7 L/h for a 70 kg individual) [[24](#R24),[25](#R25)]. Additionally, as it might be expected given age-related decreases in CYP2C19 activity in older adults [[64](#R64)], clearance was notably faster compared to a pharmacokinetic analysis in older adults with an estimated clearance of 83.1 L/h [[65](#R65)], which aligns with studies reporting faster clearance in adolescents and young adults compared to older patients [[24](#R24),[46](#R46)]. The V/F approximated to those recently reported in adults [[62](#R62)]. Extensive variability in CL/F was observed and ranged from 18.57 L/h to 275.35 L/h.

Consistent with previous reports, CYP2C19 phenotype explained a significant amount of the IIV in our estimated CL/F [[14](#R14),[62](#R62),[66](#R66),[67](#R67)]. No difference in CL/F between patients who are normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers was detected, and so these phenotypes were grouped during model development. It has been shown that carriers of the *CYP2C19* *17 allele, which confers for faster metabolism, does not influence sertraline plasma concentrations or treatment outcomes [[12](#R12),[66](#R66),[68](#R68)]; however, two recent studies in healthy adults found ultrarapid metabolizers exhibited faster CL/F and serum concentrations corresponding with decreased exposure and a shorter t_1/2_ [[12](#R12),[62](#R62)]. We observed that poor and intermediate metabolizers had on average 65% and 34% slower CL/F compared to normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers.

Patient body weight influenced the CL/F and V/F of sertraline, where patients with higher body weight eliminated sertraline faster and had larger distribution. Co-administration with a CYP2C19 inhibitor (e.g., oral contraceptives or fluoxetine) also led to a reduction in CL/F by 28% [[59](#R59)]. While explicit analyses are limited, this is consistent with one study that determined sertraline-treated patients also taking esomeprazole, a moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor, had 38.5% higher sertraline concentrations [[69](#R69)], along with the findings for escitalopram herein. Additionally, while not significantly different from concomitant oral contraceptive use, co-administration with fluoxetine resulted in a greater reduction of CL/F compared to patients taking oral contraceptives, which corresponds with fluoxetine’s more potent inhibition of CYP2C19 [[33](#R33)].

The PK of sertraline was not influenced by other demographic or clinical factors (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity, CYP2D6 phenotype, THC/CBD use). Given this, it is interesting that some [[24](#R24),[63](#R63)], but not all [[62](#R62),[70](#R70)], studies in adults found sertraline PK to be affected by sex and age. These inconsistent findings across populations likely relate to numerous factors, including the potential confounding by CYP2C19 and CYP2B6, which were not accounted for in the analysis by Ronfeld *et al* [[24](#R24),[70](#R70)]. The present study included patients who are ≤18 years, which may explain the lack of a detectable age effect. Reported THC or CBD use did not influence sertraline PK; however, unlike in prior studies which have suggested PK effects [[71](#R71)], we lacked a quantitative THC and/or CBD measure. For many patients, THC is used intermittently and in different formulations and routes of administration, in addition to use not being permitted during inpatient hospitalizations when blood specimens are obtained.

### 4.3. Escitalopram and Sertraline Simulations

The reduction in CL/F for poor and intermediate metabolizers for both escitalopram and sertraline corresponds with elevated normalized AUC_24_, C_max_, and C_trough_ relative to normal metabolizers, which may potentiate a higher risk of adverse events [[30](#R30)]. We previously showed that slower CYP2C19 metabolizers experience more escitalopram-related side effects (e.g., activation and weight gain) than faster metabolizers, which may suggest tolerability is mediated by differences in exposure due to CYP2C19 [[72](#R72)]. This hypothesis was subsequently supported by a clinical trial evaluating escitalopram treatment in anxious-youth and showed that patients who experienced activation had higher escitalopram AUC_24_ compared to those who did not [[4](#R4)]. Another retrospective study in adolescents found higher escitalopram exposure in slower metabolizers and lower exposure in faster metabolizers, which corresponded with higher incidences of treatment discontinuation in poor and ultrarapid metabolizers [[11](#R11)]. Finally, a study reported higher incidence of adverse effects in CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers who correspondingly had higher sertraline exposure [[62](#R62)]. While further research is needed to evaluate exposure-response relationships, patients with slower CYP2C19 metabolism prescribed escitalopram or sertraline should be monitored closely for adverse events and may benefit from dose adjustments to normalize exposure.

CPIC guidelines for escitalopram recommend a lower starting dose, slower titration, and a 50% reduction of the maintenance dose for poor metabolizers or to consider an alternative medication not primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. Similarly, intermediate metabolizers are recommended to use a slower titration schedule and lower maintenance dose compared to normal metabolizers. Comparatively, rapid and ultrarapid metabolizers are recommended to titrate to a higher maintenance dose if adequate response is not achieved. Normal metabolizers have no changes from standard treatment guidelines [[29](#R29)]. The results from the dose titration simulation reveal that poor metabolizers may benefit from a 50-75% dose reduction, as simulated C_trough_ at 5 mg/day produce similar exposures as other phenotypes at 15 and 20 mg/day that are within the adult therapeutic reference range. Patients who are faster CYP2C19 metabolizers, especially those who are ultrarapid metabolizers, may benefit from faster titration to achieve response, assuming there is a relationship between exposure and response. Additionally, regardless of CYP2C19 phenotype, increased exposure in patients with a smaller BSA or in those taking CYP2C19 inhibitors could increase the likelihood of side effects, and should also be considered [[4](#R4)]. It is also important to note a recent meta-analysis that suggested escitalopram has an adult therapeutic reference range of 20-40 ng/mL, where the upper threshold exhibits a “ceiling effect” regarding the maximum level of response [[73](#R73)]. While concentrations above 40 ng/mL are deemed generally safe from a tolerability standpoint, poor metabolizers are still well above this threshold at doses above 10 mg/day and would still likely benefit from these dose adjustments. Additionally, although these recommendations based on our simulations differ slightly from the current CPIC guidelines, our simulated concentrations are higher compared to previous simulations in adolescents. In this PK study, steady state concentrations for adolescent poor metabolizers were within the reference range at 20 mg/day, which was ostensibly related to increased CL/F estimates [[36](#R36)].

CPIC guidelines for sertraline suggest a lower initial dose, slower titration, and a reduction of the maintenance dose by 50% for poor metabolizers or to consider switching to an alternative medication not primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. Intermediate metabolizers are recommended to consider a slower titration schedule and lower maintenance dose compared to normal metabolizers. Normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers are recommended to initiate treatment at the standard dose and titration schedule [[29](#R29)] At a dose of 200 mg/day, poor metabolizers were above the adult therapeutic reference range of 150 ng/mL. Additionally, steady state concentrations have been reported to be achieved following one week of daily dosing, but our results suggest poor metabolizers take more than two weeks to reach steady state. Therefore, slower dose titration may be needed to more closely monitor response and tolerability. This slower titration is also important when evaluating or re-evaluating response so that a potentially effective treatment is not abandoned, particularly given that some studies suggest that—with standard titration—patients who have not responded at 8 weeks are unlikely to respond over the subsequent month [[74](#R74)]. Consistent with slower titration being needed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, a previous study revealed that clinicians actually titrated sertraline more slowly in youth with slower metabolism compared to patients who were normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers [[68](#R68)]. Conversely, normal, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizers were below the lower therapeutic reference range at 25 mg/day and may benefit from faster titration; these phenotypes were within the reference range at other doses. These findings align with CPIC recommendations to use lower doses in poor metabolizers, where a 25-50% reduction may be needed to maintain concentrations within the adult therapeutic reference range. This could be explained by faster clearance in children and adolescents compared to adults. Additionally, this supports a recent study in Scandinavian adults that found CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers may benefit from dose reductions by 60% and 25%, respectively, to normalize exposure across phenotypes [[12](#R12)].

### 4.4. Limitations

While this study is the largest population PK analysis for both escitalopram and sertraline in a pediatric population, several limitations warrant discussion. First, we utilized an opportunistic sampling strategy where we were only able to obtain, on average, one blood specimen for each patient. Because most specimens were obtained at approximately 12 and 24 hours following the last dose, this hindered our ability to estimate the K_a_ for both medications; however, the absorption for both escitalopram and sertraline is similar between adolescents and adults. The sampling strategy may also explain why lower-than-expected parameters were observed for escitalopram [[36](#R36)]. Additionally, the shrinkage for the IIV on V/F for both escitalopram and sertraline were 68% and 80%, and the shrinkage for the residual unexplained variability for escitalopram was 45%. Substantial shrinkage (i.e., >30%) indicates that the Empirical Bayes estimates may not be robust and should be interpreted with caution [[75](#R75)]. This was likely driven by the fact that there was usually only one sample per patient and samples were most often obtained at post-maximum and pre-dose trough concentrations. Further studies that utilize more frequent sampling in pediatric patients with CYP2C19 genotype data, especially during the drug absorption phase, are needed. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that the shrinkage for the IIV on CL/F for both drugs was acceptable considering CL/F was of primary interest. Second, as is common in most pharmacogenetic studies, the sample sizes of poor and ultrarapid metabolizers were limited. Third, inaccuracies or missing information in EHR data may introduce uncertainty to our dataset and estimations compared to structured clinical studies [[76](#R76)]. We may have been unable to account for changes to a patient’s medication dose or dosage or adherence concerns that occurred prior to admission that were not reported in the clinical notes, which could increase variability. Covariates were also limited to those available in the EHR and those with the potential to explain variability in escitalopram and sertraline PK; however, other covariates may influence the PK of both medications. For example, CYP2B6 genotypes were not available, although CYP2B6 contributes significantly to sertraline PK [[7](#R7),[29](#R29),[62](#R62),[67](#R67)]. Furthermore, the use of THC and/or CBD can vary significantly in terms of frequency, formulation, and route of administration that are not routinely captured in the EHR, in addition to the fact that during inpatient hospitalization when blood specimens are obtained, patients are not permitted to use CBD or to consume or consume/smoke cannabis, all of which could have limited our ability to observe an effect. Finally, while escitalopram and sertraline PK were generally similar to adults, the reference ranges used to provide context for our models are based on studies in adults, underscoring the need to develop therapeutic reference ranges and toxicity thresholds for pediatric populations [[28](#R28)]. However, SSRI response is notwithstanding of other factors independent of PK, including demonstrated benefit of cognitive behavioral therapy with pharmacotherapy [[77](#R77)-[79](#R79)] and pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., serotonergic selectivity, pharmacodynamic biomarkers and genes) [[80](#R80)-[82](#R82)].

## 5. Conclusions

These population PK analyses of escitalopram and sertraline in pediatric patients reveals significant variability in PK largely related to CYP2C19 phenotype. Our models suggest that slower CYP2C19 metabolizers, especially poor metabolizers, may benefit from dose reductions to improve tolerability [[8](#R8)]. Additionally, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers may require longer titration intervals for both medications to achieve steady state concentrations due to longer t_1/2_. Additional covariates, including BSA for escitalopram and body weight for sertraline, as well as use of concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitors should be considered. Further research is needed to evaluate for whether there are exposure-response and exposure-toxicity relationships for these medications, which necessitates measurement of pharmacodynamic variables, and to establish a therapeutic reference range for pediatric patients [[28](#R28)].
