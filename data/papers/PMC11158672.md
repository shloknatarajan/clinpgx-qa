## Abstract

The influence of three high frequency ABCB1 polymorphisms (c.1236C>T, c.2677G>A/T, and c.3435C>T) and the ABCG2 c.421C>A polymorphism on the disposition of doxorubicin in Asian breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was investigated in the present study. The allelic frequency of the ABCB1 c.1236T, c.2677T, c.2677A, and c.3435T variants were 60%, 38%, 7%, and 22%, respectively, and the frequency of the ABCG2 c.421A allele was 23%. Pairwise analysis showed increased exposure levels to doxorubicin in patients harboring at least one ABCB1 c.1236T allele (P = 0.03). Patients homozygous for the CC‐GG‐CC genotype had significantly lower doxorubicin exposure levels compared to the patients who had CT‐GT‐CT (P = 0.02) and TT‐TT‐TT genotypes (P = 0.03). Significantly increased clearance of doxorubicin was also observed in patients harboring CC‐GG‐CC genotypes when compared to patients harboring the CT‐GT‐CT genotype (P = 0.01). Patients harboring the CC‐GG‐CC genotypes had significantly lower peak plasma concentrations of doxorubicinol compared to patients who had TT‐TT‐TT genotypes (P = 0.03). No significant influences on doxorubicin pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in relation to the ABCG2 c.421C>A polymorphism. In conclusion, the present exploratory study suggests that the three high frequency linked polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene might be functionally important with regards to the altered pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in Asian breast cancer patients, resulting in significantly increased exposure levels and reduced clearance.

## Materials and Methods

**Breast cancer patients. ** Patients who had histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer (*n* = 62) and were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin were recruited for the study. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and the protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee at the National Cancer Center, Singapore. Inclusion criteria required patients to have adequate bone marrow (absolute neutrophil count >1500/µL, platelet count >100 000/µL), hepatic (aspartate amino transferase [AST] and alanine amino transferase [ALT] levels ≤ 2.5 and total bilirubin < 2.0 times upper limit of normal), and renal functions (serum creatinine <140 mmol/L) documented at the time of enrolment. Patients with serious comorbidities, including poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension, active infection, or performance status score of ≥2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale, were excluded from the study. Pregnancy and use of growth factors during the cycle of chemotherapy were also considered as criteria for exclusion. No forms of endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic response modifiers were allowed during the period of chemotherapy.

** ABCB1 and ABCG2 genotyping. ** Purified genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples (5 mL) and hepatic tissues using the phenol–chloroform extraction method. The liver tissues were obtained from colon cancer patients undergoing hepatectomy for liver metastasis. Genotyping for the *ABCB1 *(GenBank accession number [NM_000927](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_000927)) c.*1236C>T*, c.*2677G>T/A*, and c.*3435C>T* polymorphisms was carried out using restriction enzymes *Eco*01091, *Mbo*I, and *Ban*I*/Rsa*I, respectively, as described in Chowbay *et al*.^(^ [15](#b15) ^)^ Genotyping for the *ABCG2* (GenBank accession number [NM_004827](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_004827)) c.*421C>A* polymorphism was carried out by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism using *Mse*I.^(^ [27](#b27) ^)^ Digested fragments were analyzed by electrophoretic separation on a 40% polyacrylamide gel, followed by direct visualization under ultraviolet light.

**Doxorubicin treatment and pharmacokinetic analysis. ** Doxorubicin was given at a dose of 60 mg/m^2^ intravenously (i.v.) over 20 min, once every 3‐week cycle after standard premedications with i.v. dexamethasone 10 mg, diphenhydramine 50 mg, cimetidine 300 mg, or ranitidine 50 mg. All patients received concomitant i.v. cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m^2^ given over 30 min once every 3 weeks. Hematological parameters including hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, platelet count, and the absolute neutrophil count were measured after the start of treatment (days 7 and 14) and prior to the start of each cycle. New treatment cycles were started only if the absolute neutrophil count was ≥1500/µL and the platelet count was ≥100 000/µL. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained at the following time points after the start of infusion on the first day of the first cycle of chemotherapy: at predose and 5 min; postinfusion at 15 and 30 min; and at 1, 4, 8, and 24 h. Blood samples were collected in plain ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid containing vacutainer glass tubes and immediately centrifuged at 1000 *g* for 10 min; the plasma fraction was collected and stored at –20°C until analysis.

Plasma concentrations of doxorubicin and its major metabolite doxorubicinol were estimated by reversed‐phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.^(^ [28](#b28) ^)^ Briefly, following a single protein precipitation step, chromatographic separation was accomplished using a C‐18 column with a mobile phase consisting of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer–acetonitrile–1‐propanol (65:25:2, v/v), pH 2.0. The analytes were measured by fluorescence detection with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission wavelength of 560 nm. The lower limits of quantitation were 10 ng/mL for doxorubicin and 5 ng/mL for doxorubicinol. The calibration curves were linear over a concentration range of 10–2500 ng/mL for doxorubicin and 5–1250 ng/mL for doxorubicinol. The average recoveries were greater than 89% for all analytes and within‐day and between‐day coefficients of variation was less than 13%.

Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using a non‐linear regression program WinNonLin version 2.1 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA, USA). The area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) was calculated from time 0 to the time (t) of the last detectable concentration (AUC_0→t_) using the trapezoidal rule. The area was extrapolated to infinity (AUC_0‐∞_) by adding C_t_/λz to AUC_0→t_, where C_t_ was the last detectable plasma concentration and λz is the elimination rate constant. Peak plasma concentrations (C_max_) were directly identified from individual subject concentration–time curves.

**Statistical analysis. ** The χ^2^ analysis was used to test for departure of genotype frequencies from Hardy–Weinberg expectations. The possible contribution of subject characteristics (ethnicity, age, height, and body surface area [BSA]) on pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol were determined using univariate linear regression analysis. Other independent variables investigated to evaluate their relative contribution to the variability in pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol included patient biochemical parameters such as albumin, total protein, and markers of hepatic (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) and renal function (serum creatinine). The non‐parametric Mann–Whitney *U*‐test was used for pairwise comparisons between genotype groups. Pharmacokinetic parameters are reported as median values unless otherwise indicated. The minimum level of statistical significance was set at *P* = 0.05 for pairwise comparisons. Linkage analysis between the *ABCB1 *polymorphisms was carried out using Haploview software version 3.32 ([http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview](http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview)). All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata Statistical Software release 7.0 (Stata Corporation, TX, USA).

## Results

**Subject demographics. ** Most of the breast cancer patients belonged to the Chinese ethnic group (74%), followed by Malays (18%), and Indians (8%). The median age, height, and BSA of the patients were 51 years (range, 29–73 years), 154 cm (range, 144–168 cm), and 1.52 m^2^ (range, 1.23–1.95 m^2^), respectively.

**Doxorubicin pharmacokinetics. ** The pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol in Asian breast cancer patients are summarized in [Table 1](#t1). Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were available in 52 of the 62 patients and a high degree of interpatient variability was observed with regards to the pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol. The clearance (CL) of doxorubicin was 22.9 L/h/m^2^ and was within the range reported in published studies.^(^ [29](#b29) ^)^ Approximately six‐fold (median, 22.9; range, 8.7–55.7 L/h/m^2^) variation in CL and 13‐fold (median, 237.5; range, 53.9–703.7/Lm^2^) variations in volume of distribution at steady state (V_ss_) of doxorubicin were observed among the cancer patients. Interpatient variability was also high with regards to doxorubicinol pharmacokinetic parameters with more than six‐fold variation observed in its AUC_0‐∞_ (median, 9.6; range, 3.7–24.3/hm^5^). Univariate analysis revealed patient's height and weight to be significant covariates influencing the AUC_0‐∞_(*P <* 0.015 and *P* < 0.0001, respectively) and C_max_ of doxorubicin (*P <* 0.028 and* P* < 0.0001, respectively). Age and ethnicity were identified as significant covariates in relation to the t_1/2 _(h) of doxorubicin (*P <* 0.018). The half‐life of doxorubicin was analyzed in patients following stratification according to their age (below and above 60 years). The t_1/2 _(h) of doxorubicin was significantly higher in patients above 60 years of age (median, 15.73; range 4.7–24.6) compared with patients below 60 years of age (median, 12.54; range, 8.1–17.8; *P* < 0.02). No significant influence of covariates, including markers of hepatic (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) or renal (serum creatinine) functions, were observed on doxorubicin pharmacokinetic parameters.

The observed genotype distribution in both genes conformed to Hardy–Weinberg proportions. The allelic frequency of the *ABCB1* c.*1236T*, c.*2677T*, and c.*2677A*, and *ABCB2* c.*3435T* variants among Asian breast cancer patients were 60%, 38%, 7%, and 22%, respectively, and were in agreement with previously published reports in Asian healthy populations.^(^ [15](#b15) ^)^ The frequency of the *ABCG2* c.*421 A* allele was 23% and patients homozygous for the variant allele were absent in the cancer patients. The allele frequency of the c.*421C>A* polymorphism was comparable to earlier reports in the Asian population.^(^ [30](#b30) ^)^ Linkage analysis showed a moderate degree of linkage between all three *ABCB1* polymorphisms (c.*2677G>T/A *and c.*3435C>T,*|*D*′| = 0.63; c.*1236C>T* and c.*3435C>T*, |*D*′| = 0.56; and c.*1236C>T* and c.*2677G>T/A*, |*D*′| = 0.57] ([Fig. 1](#f1)).

Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the multidrug resistance gene ABCB1 polymorphisms c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A, and c.3435C>T in Asian cancer patients. The intensity of the colors indicates the linkage between polymorphisms.

**Genotypic–phenotypic correlates. ** The influence of *ABCB1* polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin in Asian breast cancer patients are summarized in [Table 3](#t3). Significant correlations of doxorubicin pharmacokinetic parameters with *ABCB1* c.*1236C>T* polymorphism were observed. As no significant differences were observed in pharmacokinetic parameters between cancer patients carrying one or two variant alleles at the *ABCB1 1236* locus, patients harboring the c.*1236CT* and c.*1236TT* genotypes were grouped together and compared with the reference genotype. Breast cancer patients carrying a least one c.*1236T *allele had significantly higher (69%) peak plasma concentrations of doxorubicin (C_max_/dose/BSA (/m^5^), median, 36.8; range, 10.4–97.7) when compared to the patients carrying the reference genotype (C_max_/dose/BSA (/m^5^), median, 21.8; range: 4.6–57.9; *P* = 0.03). The exposure level of doxorubicin was 42% higher in patients who carried at least one c.*1236T* allele (AUC_0‐∞_/dose/BSA (h/m^5^): median, 18.8; range, 8.2–38.0) compared to patients who were homozygous for the reference genotype (AUC_0‐∞_/dose/BSA (h/m^5^), median, 13.2; range, 6.2–67.2; *P* = 0.07). The clearance of doxorubicin was approximately 25% lower in patients carrying at least one variant *T *allele compared with patients carrying the reference genotype (*P =* 0.14).

As depicted in [Table 3](#t3), patients who were heterozygous for the c.*2677G>T/A* polymorphism showed a trend towards higher doxorubicin exposure levels (AUC_0‐∞_/dose/BSA (h/m^5^), median, 19.8; range, 6.2–38.0) compared to patients homozygous for the reference allele (AUC_0‐∞_/dose/BSA (h/m^5^), median, 15.2; range, 7.1–67.2, *P* > 0.05). The clearance of doxorubicin was significantly higher among patients who harbored the homozygous variant alleles for the c.*2677G>T/A *polymorphism (CL/BSA (Lh^−1^/m^2^), median, 30.3; range, 13.8–55.7] when compared to patients who were heterozygous (CL/BSA (Lh^−1^/m^2^), median, 21.7; range, 15.0–49.4, *P* = 0.01] and homozygous for the reference allele (CL/BSA (Lh^−1^/m^2^), median, 22.3; range, 8.7–36.9, *P* = 0.04). Pairwise analysis failed to reveal any significant influences of the c.*3435C>T* polymorphism on pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin. No significant influences of *ABCB1* polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicinol were observed in the present study.

[Table 4](#t4) shows the doxorubicin pharmacokinetic parameters by the three major genotypes of *ABCB1* exon 12, 21, and 26 polymorphisms in Asian breast cancer patients. Patients homozygous for the *CC‐GG‐CC* genotype had significantly lower doxorubicin exposure levels (AUC_0‐∞_/dose/BSA (h/m^5^), median, 11.13; range, 7.12–13.21) compared to the patients who had heterozygous (*CT‐GT‐CT*) (AUC_0‐∞_/dose/BSA (h/m^5^), median, 19.0; range, 11.88–31.6, *P* = 0.02) and homozygous (*TT‐TT‐TT*) genotypes (AUC_0‐∞_/dose/BSA (h/m^5^), median, 17.59; range, 12.55–30.16; *P* = 0.03) at the three loci ([Fig. 2a](#f2)). Patients harboring the *CC‐GG‐CC* genotypes also had significantly lower peak plasma concentrations of doxorubicin (C_max_/dose/BSA (/m^5^), median, 14.63; range, 7.0–22.23) compared to patients who harbored the *CT‐GT‐CT* (C_max_/dose/BSA (/m^5^), median, 32.99; range, 18.3–73.5, *P* = 0.02) and *TT‐TT‐TT* genotypes (C_max_/dose/BSA (/m^5^), median, 37.98; range, 20.9–80.7; *P* = 0.03). The significantly lower exposure levels of doxorubicin in patients harboring *CC‐GG‐CC* genotypes was also associated with a significantly increased clearance of doxorubicin (CL/BSA (Lh^−1^/m^2^), median, 31.73; range, 24.8–36.9) when compared to patients harboring the *CT‐GT‐CT* genotype (CL/BSA (Lh^−1^/m^2^), median, 21.9; range, 15.0–28.5; *P* = 0.01) ([Fig. 2b](#f2)). With regards to doxorubicinol, patients harboring the *CC‐GG‐CC* genotypes had significantly lower peak plasma concentrations of doxorubicinol (C_max_/dose/BSA (/m^5^), median, 0.22; range, 0.16–0.32) compared to the patients who had *TT‐TT‐TT* genotypes (C_max_/dose/BSA (/m^5^), median: 0.39; range: 0.31–0.57, *P* = 0.03].

## Discussion

Several studies have reported higher bioavailability of *ABCB1* drug substrates in carriers of the *T* allele at the *ABCB1* c.*3435* locus, attributed to lower functional activity of the protein or reduced ABCB1 expression.^(^ [31](#b31) ^)^ The search for causal mechanisms has confirmed varying degrees of contribution from the *ABCB1* c.*1236C>T* and c.*2677G>T/A* polymorphisms. The c.*1236C>T*, c.*2677G>T/A*, and c.*3435C>T* polymorphisms are known to be in linkage disequilibrium, and population studies in different ethnic groups have revealed significant heterogeneity in the patterns of haplotype structures. Although several studies have been published, there is no consensus regarding a definitive influence of major *ABCB1* polymorphisms on drug disposition either independently or as part of different haplotypes.^(^ [7](#b7), [32](#b32), [33](#b33) ^)^

In the present study, pairwise analysis suggested that the *ABCB1* c.*1236C>T* polymorphism might have a functional influence on doxorubicin pharmacokinetics resulting in increased exposure levels to doxorubicin in patients harboring at least one c.*1236T* allele. This finding was similar to an earlier report of the effect of the c.*1236C>T *polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporinee where subjects with the c.*1236CC* genotype had slight but significantly lower dose‐adjusted C_max_ and AUC_0–4 h_ of cyclosporinee compared with mutated allele carriers.^(^ [14](#b14) ^)^ With regards to the influence of the c.*2677G >T/A* polymorphism, a trend of higher exposure levels and significantly decreased clearance of doxorubicin was observed in c.*2677G>T/A* heterozygote patients when compared to patients who were homozygous for the c.*2677T* and c.*2677 A* alleles. The non‐synonymous c.*2677G>T/A* polymorphism has been previously shown to be associated with alterations in saturation kinetics of vincristine,^(^ [32](#b32) ^)^ and the bioavailability of other ABCB1 substrates, but most often has been analyzed in conjunction with the c.*3435C>T* polymorphism. The possible mechanistic roles of naturally occurring synonymous variations was highlighted in a recent report investigating the *ABCB1* c.*3435C*>T polymorphism showing alterations in conformation following changes in translation kinetics due to the rare codon usage at c.*3435T*, resulting in variations in the structure of substrate and inhibitor binding sites.^(^ [34](#b34) ^)^ Our results, however, failed to reveal any significant influence of the *ABCB1* c.*3435C>T* polymorphism on doxorubicin disposition in the present study. This could be due to the minimal phenotypic influence of the c.*3435C>T* polymorphism, or due to its effects being masked by the multiple determinants of doxorubicin disposition including those from other transporter proteins and metabolizing enzymes.

Recent studies have suggested that the association of the *ABCB1* polymorphisms with phenotypic correlates might be better explained by considering the composite influence of genetic information from the *ABCB1 1236*, *2677*, and *3435* loci.^(^ [15](#b15), [17](#b17) ^)^ Haplotype analysis of *ABCB1* gene blocks in the Japanese population have shown a genotype‐dependent renal clearance of irinotecan.^(^ [35](#b35) ^)^ Haplotype–phenotype evaluations of the drug metabolizing enzyme *CYP2C8 *have also been shown to delineate the subset of patients having altered pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel,^(^ [36](#b36) ^)^ suggesting that haplotype analysis of candidate gene polymorphisms might have significant roles in understanding interindividual variations in the pharmacokinetics of antineoplastic agents. In order to observe the net effect of all three *ABCB1* polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol, we analyzed the contribution of these polymorphisms using the genotype information from the *ABCB1 1236‐2677‐3435* loci. Patients with the *CC‐GG‐CC* genotype constitution were associated with lower exposure levels and increased clearance of doxorubicin when compared to the subjects harboring the *TT‐TT‐TT* genotype. The observation of reduced peak plasma concentrations of doxorubicin in these subjects who were homozygous for the reference allele at all the three loci is similar to earlier reports on the influence of *ABCB1 *haplotypes on cyclosporine levels.^(^ [15](#b15) ^)^ In a study investigating the influence of *ABCB1* haplotypes on cyclosporinee disposition in heart transplant recipients, it was observed that patients homozygous for the *CC‐GG‐CC* genotypes had lower peak and trough cyclosporine concentrations as well AUC_0–4 h_ and AUC_0–12 h_, whereas higher levels were observed in patients carrying mutations at all three loci. The study also showed that the *C *allele at exon 12 was associated with *G* and *A* allele at the *2677 *loci, which in turn linked significantly with the c.*3435C* allele. Homozygosity at all three *ABCB1* loci was associated with reduced cyclosporinee exposure levels. The tight linkage of the *ABCB1* c.*1236C>T* polymorphism with the c.*2677G>T/A* and c.*3435C>T* polymorphisms has also been shown to serve as an important marker influencing irinotecan clearance in Japanese cancer patients.^(^ [35](#b35) ^)^ Taken together, our results suggest that linkage between *ABCB1* polymorphisms might be important in influencing doxorubicin disposition. Our study, however, does not address the possibility of doxorubicin disposition being subject to the influence of other *ABCB1* polymorphisms that have been shown to be part of important haplotype structures in different populations.^(^ [16](#b16) ^)^ Given the modest sample size of patients analyzed, the findings should be considered exploratory in nature, and larger studies with a higher sample size must be carried out to arrive at definitive conclusions.

ABCG2 has been associated with drug resistance and cell lines overexpressing the protein have been shown to be several‐fold resistant to doxorubicin. In earlier studies, the *ABCG2* c.*421C>A *polymorphism resulted in markedly decreased protein expression and low‐level drug resistance compared to ABCG2 transfected cells carrying the reference genotype.^(^ [25](#b25) ^)^ The c.*421C>A* polymorphism occurs with a higher frequency among Asians (30–60%) when compared to Caucasians and black Americans (5–10%), and has been associated with low protein expression and subsequent sensitivity to anticancer agents.^(^ [37](#b37) ^)^ The wide ethnic variations in allele frequency distribution of the *ABCG2* c.*421C>A* polymorphism suggests their potential contribution to interindividual variability in drug disposition.^(^ [26](#b26), [38](#b38) ^)^ Our study, however, failed to show any influence of the c.*421C>A* polymorphism on pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol in Asian breast cancer patients. Further studies are required to identify mechanisms behind the observed disparate pharmacokinetic modulation of drugs that have similar substrate specificities for ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters.^(^ [39](#b39) ^)^ It is also possible that the multiplicity of transporters involved in the transport of doxorubicin across membranes could mask the contribution, if any, of the *ABCG2 *c.*421C>A* polymorphism. Further studies are required to conclusively ascertain the relationship of *ABCG2* c.*421C>A* polymorphism to doxorubicin disposition.

The pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin could also be influenced by polymorphic variations in genes encoding other doxorubicin transporting proteins and metabolizing enzymes in the doxorubicin biochemical pathway. We had earlier reported on the higher exposure levels of doxorubicin in Asian breast cancer patients homozygous for the highly linked c.*146A>G* and c.*312T>C* polymorphisms in influx transporter *SLC22A16 *gene.^(^ [40](#b40) ^)^ Further studies are required to investigate polymorphisms in genes encoding the efflux transporters ABCB5, ABCC5, and the Ral‐interacting protein RLIP76 which have been shown to confer *in vitro* doxorubicin resistance.^(^ [41](#b41), [42](#b42), [43](#b43) ^)^ * In vitro* studies in doxorubicin selected cell lines suggested a role for MRP1 (ABCC1) induction in resistance to treatment in myeloid leukemia.^(^ [44](#b44) ^)^ Naturally occurring non‐synonymous mutations (Arg433Ser) in the *MRP1* cytoplasmic domain, leading to doxorubicin resistance,^(^ [45](#b45) ^)^ also needs further investigation in terms of its role in altering doxorubicin disposition in cancer patients.

The biotransformation of doxorubicin to doxorubicinol occurs primarily in the liver, by the cytoplasmic carbonyl reductases (CBR1 and CBR3) and aldo‐keto reductase metabolizing enzymes.^(^ [46](#b46) ^)^ Subsequent metabolism by hydrolytic glycosidic cleavage and reduction leads to production of doxorubicinone and 7‐deoxydoxorubicinone from doxorubicin, and doxorubicinolone and 7‐deoxydoxorubicinolone from doxorubicinol. Polymorphisms in *CBR1* and *CBR3* genes have been shown to have significant functional consequences,^(^ [47](#b47), [48](#b48) ^)^ and might influence doxorubicin disposition. The *CBR1* c.*262G>A* (V88I) polymorphism results in isoforms with distinct kinetic and thermodynamic properties whereas the *CBR3* c.*730G>A* (V244M) polymorphism has been shown to result in higher enzyme catalytic efficiency. Further population‐based studies are required to understand the contribution of polymorphisms in genes encoding *CBR1* and *CBR3* to the observed variations in pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol in patients receiving chemotherapy.

In conclusion, the present exploratory study suggests that polymorphisms in the *ABCB1* gene could be functionally important with regards to the altered pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin. The linked *ABCB1 1236‐2677‐3435* genotypes were found to significantly influence the disposition of doxorubicin in Asian breast cancer patients, resulting in significantly increased exposure levels, peak plasma concentrations, and reduced clearance in patients who were homozygous for the variant allele at the three loci. No significant influences on doxorubicin pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in relation to the *ABCG2 *c.*421C>A* polymorphism. Further studies that also investigate other pharmacogenetic candidates across the doxorubicin biochemical pathway are warranted in cancer patients of other ethnic groups to conclusively ascertain the identified genotypic–phenotypic relationships in the present study.
