## Abstract

Genetic variation in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (CYP3A4/5) genes, which encode the key enzymes in tacrolimus metabolism, is associated with tacrolimus clearance and dose requirements. Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index with high intra- and intersubject variability, in part because of genetic variation. High tacrolimus clearance and low trough concentration are associated with a greater risk for rejection, whereas high troughs are associated with calcineurin-induced toxicity. The objective of this study was to develop a model of tacrolimus clearance with a dosing equation accounting for genotypes and clinical factors in adult kidney transplant recipients of European ancestry that could preemptively guide dosing. Recipients receiving immediate-release tacrolimus for maintenance immunosuppression from 2 multicenter studies were included. Participants in the GEN03 study were used for tacrolimus model development (n = 608 recipients) and was validated by prediction performance in the DeKAF Genomics study (n = 1361 recipients). Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to develop the apparent oral tacrolimus clearance (CL/F) model. CYP3A4/5 genotypes and clinical covariates were tested for their influence on CL/F. The predictive performance of the model was determined by assessing the bias (median prediction error [ME] and median percentage error [MPE]) and the precision (root median squared error [RMSE]) of the model. CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*22, corticosteroids, calcium channel blocker and antiviral drug use, age, and diabetes significantly contributed to the interindividual variability of oral tacrolimus apparent clearance. The bias (ME, MPE) and precision (RMSE) of the final model was good, 0.49 ng/mL, 6.5%, and 3.09 ng/mL, respectively. Prospective testing of this equation is warranted.

## Methods

### Participants

Data were obtained from 2 multicenter observational studies (GEN03 and Deterioration of Kidney Allograft Function [DeKAF]) approved by local institutional review boards. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. The studies are registered at [www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) ([NCT00270712](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00270712) and [NCT01714440](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01714440)). A total of 1969 adult (≥18 years) kidney transplant recipients were eligible for this analysis. Participants were included if they were of European ancestry, as determined through principal components analysis, and received immediate-release oral tacrolimus for maintenance immunosuppression post-transplant. The GEN03 study was conducted from 2012 to 2016 and included 608 recipients from 5 centers: University of Minnesota, Hennepin County Medical Center, University of Alabama, Mayo Clinic-Rochester, and University of Iowa. The DeKAF study was conducted from 2005 to 2010 and included 1361 recipients from 7 centers: University of Minnesota, Hennepin County Medical Center, University of Alabama, Mayo Clinic-Rochester, University of Iowa, University of Manitoba, and University of Alberta. Patient demographics and dose ranges are presented in [Table 1](#T1).

Table 1 Caption: Study Population Characteristics

Participants received tacrolimus with mycophenolate along with corticosteroids for varying durations by center protocols. Induction was given per center preference but primarily contained rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG), basiliximab, or Campath-1H. Immunologically high-risk patients (eg, donor-specific antibody, prior pregnancies, or repeat transplants) were more likely to receive rATG. Recipient characteristics, such as serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and concomitant medications, were obtained from the electronic health records. Tacrolimus trough whole-blood measurements were measured clinically at each center and were analyzed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Methods–approved laboratories; *>*95% were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Tacrolimus trough concentrations were obtained twice each week for the first 8 weeks, and 2 troughs per month in months 3, 4, 5, and 6 for a maximum of 24 trough concentrations per patient. Tacrolimus doses and dosing intervals were adjusted based on troughs to achieve center-specific trough goals and were generally 8–12 ng/mL in months 0 to 3 and 6–10 ng/mL in months 4 to 6. Dose was also adjusted for side effects (eg, tacrolimus-associated rise in SCr) by center-specific practices. All participants received the immediate-release formulation of tacrolimus (Prograf or generic), and no participants received the extended-release formulation. A total of 34 650 trough concentrations from the 1969 recipients were analyzed.

### Genotyping

Pretransplant recipient blood was collected at each center at time of transplant, and DNA was isolated at a central laboratory at the University of Minnesota. Lymphocytes were isolated by centrifugation after red blood cell lysis and the DNA isolated. Genotyping was performed on a custom exome-plus Affymetrix TxAr-ray genome-wide association study (GWAS) single-nucleotide polymorphism chip.^39^ This chip contained ~782 000 markers including pharmacogenomic variants, 168 000 exonic or coding variants, and more than 16 000 putative loss-of-function variants. The *CYP3A5*3* (*rs776746*) and *CYP3A4*22* (*rs35599367*) genotypes were obtained from this chip. The variants did not diverge from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genotyping and data quality control for this chip have been previously described.^25,40^ European ancestry of each individual was determined by principal components analysis (PCA) of ancestry computed from the GWAS panel and through knowledge of self-reported ancestry and was previously described.^41^ There was high concordance with self-reported ancestry and PC-defined ancestry; however, when discordance was raised, PCA-defined ancestry was assigned to that individual.

### Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling

Data from the GEN03 study, with 10 992 troughs from 608 recipients, was used for model development. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM version 7.4 software; ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Maryland) was performed to develop tacrolimus apparent oral clearance (CL/F) model and a subsequent dosing equation by first-order conditional estimation method with interaction. Exploratory analyses and diagnostic graphics were performed with R 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019) and RStudio 1.2.5001 (RStudio, Inc., The R Development Core Team) and Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN 4.9.0, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) under the Pirana interface.^42^

Our previously developed pharmacokinetic base model was used.^17^ In this study, the $PRED library in NONMEM was employed and pharmacokinetic base model was developed using a steady-state infusion model. Because of the longer half-life for tacrolimus (approximately 12 hours, with a range of 3.5 to 40.5 hours), minimal peak-trough fluctuation is expected and steady-state trough concentrations were assumed to be approximately equivalent to average daily Cp,ss. Hence, Ctroughapproximately equals average daily Cp,ss. Because intravenous data for the tacrolimus were absent, it was not possible to calculate oral bioavailability. Therefore, tacrolimus CL/F, which is the ratio of total clearance (CL) to bioavailability (F), was used to regress average daily Cp,ss to the administered dose. CL/F was related to tacrolimus trough concentrations using the following equation:

| Ctrough=averagedailyCp,ss |
| --- |
| =totaldailytacrolimusdose/([CL/F]×24). |
| --- |
Although, the factual apparent oral clearance may differ from this approximated CL/F; this difference is negligible for drugs with longer half-lives, such as tacrolimus.

Two-level nested random effects were included in the model: interindividual variability (IIV) and intercenter variability (ICV). The interindividual variability of tacrolimus CL/F was estimated with an exponential error model and expressed as:

| CL/Fi=TVCL/FxexpηIIVi |
| --- |
where CL/F is a function of the typical value of apparent oral clearance (TVCL/F) and the individual parameter for the ith subject, with (ηIIV)i the estimate of individual deviation from TVCL/F and assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance ω2.

In the developed model, random effects explaining variability between 1 transplant center and the next (ICV) was mapped based on the $LEVEL record in NONMEM. Each study center in the development cohort has a separate identification number in the data set. Subjects from the same center share the same random effect. NONMEM is informed such that ηICV is a CL/Fη that changes only with every study center and is associated by nesting with ηIIV, which varies with each subject, and was estimated with an exponential error model and expressed as:

| CL/Fi=TVCL/FxexpηIIV+ηICVi |
| --- |
where (ηICV)i is the estimate of center deviation from TVCL/F and is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance ω2. The reason ηIIV and ηICV are associated together is that η in both provides random effects to the same parameter of CL/F.

For the residual unexplained variability, additive and proportional error models were used and expressed as:

| Cij=Cpred,ij∗1+ε(prop)ij+ε(add)ij |
| --- |
where Cij is the observed concentration and Cpredij is the corresponding model-predicted concentration with the ith individual at the jth occasion, εpropij is proportional error and assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance σ2, and εaddij is additive error and is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance σ2.

### Covariate Analysis

Demographics, clinical factors, and genetic variants were evaluated for their influence on tacrolimus TVCL/F. The demographics evaluated were recipient body weight (kg), recipient age, donor age, donor deceased status, recipient sex, donor sex, days post-transplant, smoking, ethnicity, recipient race, donor race, and glomerular filtration rate. Medications used at each trough measurement were evaluated and included steroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), antiviral drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, and voriconazole. Disease conditions considered were diabetes and post-transplant dialysis for delayed graft function. Genetic variants tested were *CYP3A5*3* and *CYP3A4*22* because these are the common tacrolimus variants in EAs. Recipients who did not carry any *CYP3A5*3* alleles were designated a *CYP3A5*1/*1* genotype and those who carried 1 or 2 *CYP3A5*3* allele were designated either a *CYP3A5*1/*3* or a *CYP3A5*3/*3* genotype. For *CYP3A4*, recipients were classified as *CYP3A4*1/*1, CYP3A4*1/*22* or *CYP3A4*22/*22*.

Covariate assessment was conducted by the stepwise covariate modeling in a PsN tool kit. Stepwise covariate modeling involved testing of covariate relationships in forward inclusion and backward exclusion processes. The significance of inclusion and elimination of each covariate was tested based on likelihood ratio test that follows the χ2 distribution. A decrease in objective function value (OFV) by 3.8 or more (*P <* .05) was considered significant for forward inclusion. A full model was built that included all the covariates that showed a significant decrease in OFV following forward inclusion. Each covariate was then reevaluated through a backward elimination process. The covariates yielding an increase in OFV by 10.8 or more (P<.001) were considered significant and retained in the final model.

### Model Evaluation and Predictive Ability of the Pharmacokinetic Parameters

The precision of the final model parameters were evaluated with sampling-importance-resampling (SIR)-based 95% confidence intervals (CIs).^43,44^ The final models were evaluated using prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPC; 1000 simulations).^45^ Data from the DeKAF Genomics study, with 23 658 troughs from 1361 recipients, was used to validate model prediction performance from the GEN03 data set. The final model parameters and significant covariates were fixed in NONMEM and were used to predict trough concentrations in the validation cohort subjects. Population-predicted trough concentrations (PRED) were obtained for each observed concentration (dependent variable) given their actual administered dose, the time after transplant, and the significant clinical covariates and genotypes (which were identified from the development model). The bias (median prediction error [ME], median percentage error [MPE]) and the precision (root median squared error [RMSE]) of population prediction (PRED) was used to assess the predictive performance. The following equations were used:

| ME=Median(PRED−DV) |
| --- |
| MPE=Median[(PRED−DV)/DV×100] |
| --- |
| RMSE=Median[(PRED−DV)] |
| --- |
## Results

Characteristics of the participants in the development and validation cohorts are shown in [Table 1](#T1). The typical value estimate of tacrolimus apparent clearance (CL/F) was 32.2 L/h. The estimates of IIV and ICV as coefficient of variation (CV%) were 41.9% and 31.3%, respectively. Steroid, calcium channel blocker, and antiviral drug use, age, diabetes, time posttransplant, and *CYP3A5*1, *3*, and *CYP3A4*22* alleles were found to significantly contribute to the interindividual variability of oral tacrolimus CL/F in EAs. The effect of genotypes and clinical covariates on tacrolimus CL/F and final parameter estimates in the model development cohort and in the SIR analysis is shown in [Table 2](#T2).

Table 2 Caption: Final Tacrolimus Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates, Precision, and Shrinkage in Development Cohort

The final population pharmacokinetic model from the development cohort showed that tacrolimus CL/F decreased by 13% on average if the recipient was diabetic, 5% if receiving a CCB, and 9% if receiving an antiviral drug. Tacrolimus CL/F also decreased as the recipient’s age increased. Tacrolimus CL/F increased by 6% if recipient was receiving a corticosteroid at the time of tough measurement. CL/F of tacrolimus was 18% lower after day 8 posttransplant relative to day 8 or before. Other tested clinical factors were not significant (P>.001) on CL/F.

The effect of the genotypes was profound. In recipients with the *CYP3A5*1/*1 or CYP3A5*1/*3* genotype, the tacrolimus CL/F increased by 305%, and 181%, respectively, compared with recipients with the *CYP3A5*3/*3* genotype. For recipients with 1 or 2 *CYP3A4*22* alleles, the CL/F declined by 22% and 72%, respectively, relative to recipients with no *CYP3A4*22* alleles. The final model and dose equation are given below:

CL/F(L/h) = 32.2 (L/h) × ([1.81, if *CYP3A5*1/*3*] × [3.05, if *CYP3A5*1/*1*] × [0.78, if *1 CYP3A4*22*] × [0.28, if *2 CYP3A4*22*] × [1.06, if receiving a *steroid*] × [0.95, if receiving a calcium channel blocker] × [0.87, if diabetic] × [0.91, if receiving an antiviral drug] × [(*AGE*/52)^–0.3^]) × (0.82, if after day 8 posttransplant)

**Daily dose** (mg/day) = (**CL/F** × target tacrolimus trough concentration [ng/mL] × 24 hours)/1000

### Model Evaluation and Predictive Ability of Pharmacokinetic Parameters

The diagnostic scatterplots showed an acceptable overall goodness of fit of the final model ([Figure 1](#F1)). The final model parameter estimates were all within their SIR-based 95%CIs ([Table 2](#T2)). Parameter estimates for fixed and random effects obtained from the original data set fell within the prediction interval of the estimates obtained from SIR, indicating that the model is robust and reproducible.

Dots represent the observed tacrolimus trough concentrations. Solid line is the line at y=0.

The predictive performance of the final pharmacokinetic model, was measured through bias (ME, MPE) and precision (RMSE) in the validation cohort. The ME, MPE, and RMSE for all trough concentrations in the validation data were 0.49 ng/mL, 6.5%, and 3.09 ng/mL, respectively. This suggests that, on median, the model overpredicted the trough concentrations relative to the observed concentrations.

## Discussion

We developed a tacrolimus dosing model and clinical equation that simultaneously accounts for genotypes and clinical factors in a large sample of adult kidney transplant recipients with European ancestry using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. Steroid, CCB, and antiviral drug use, age, diabetes, time post-transplant, and *CYP3A5*1, *3*, and *CYP3A4*22* alleles were identified as significant factors influencing tacrolimus clearance and were subsequently accounted for in the model. The model was then validated with data from the DeKAF Genomics data set. We previously developed and validated an African American-specific model with 3 *CYP3A5* variants along with clinical factors.^17^ The data here are consistent with our previous work in which models had to combine genotypes and clinical factors to robustly explain variability in clearance.

Our analysis identified a significant effect of several medications on tacrolimus CL/F. Concomitant use of steroids was reported with 64% of the trough concentrations and was associated with an increase in tacrolimus CL/F by 6%. Literature reports have also shown a significant association between relative tacrolimus clearance and steroid use.^46^ Corticosteroids are inducers of CYP3A enzymes^47–50^ and are well known for their drug interactions with CYP3A substrates. CCB and antiviral drugs were concomitantly present in 40% and 52%, respectively, of the troughs. For subjects receiving a CCB in the development cohort, 57% of them received amlodipine, felodipine, nimodipine, or nisoldipine; 6.5% received isradipine, nicardipine, or nifedipine; and 6.5% received diltiazem or verapamil for up to 6 months. Both CCB and antiviral drug use decreased tacrolimus CL/F by 5% and 9%, respectively. Drug interactions between CCBs and tacrolimus have been previously described, especially with diltiazem and verapamil, which are mechanism-based inhibitors of P450.^51,52^

We explored the potential effect of ACE inhibitors and antifungal drugs on tacrolimus CL/F, but no significant effects were detected. Tacrolimus is not known to interact with ACE inhibitors clinically, and our data are consistent with this knowledge. Antifungal drugs can inhibit CY3A4/5 and tacrolimus metabolism.^53,54^ Only 65 recipients, mostly on fluconazole, an antifungal drug, were in the GEN03 cohort, and the absence of an effect may be because of the small sample size and the relatively weak inhibition of CYP3A4/5 of fluconazole relative to itraconazole.

We found that tacrolimus CL/F decreased by 18% after day 8 posttransplant up to 6 months posttransplant relative to day 8 or before. We and others have previously described that tacrolimus clearance declines with increasing time posttransplantation and may be because of a reduction in CYP3A activity, a rising hematocrit, physiological changes occurring in hepatic and kidney function, and/or gastrointestinal motility.^13,15–17,55^ We also found that tacrolimus CL/F decreased as recipient age increased; other studies have shown no significant relationship between age and tacrolimus.^12,14,56–59^ Age is a factor known to influence drug metabolism of many other drugs.^60,61^ About 30% of our enrolled participants were diabetic at the time of transplant, which was associated with a 13% decrease in tacrolimus CL/F relative to nondiabetic subjects. Hematocrit is also a significant factor for whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations because of high accumulation in erythrocytes. One of the limitations of our study is that hematocrit data were not available in our study and not tested in our model. Low hematocrit levels are associated with lower whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations and can be incorrectly interpreted as an increase in CL/F when concentrations and clearance are actually unchanged.^62–64^ Hematocrit levels are generally low in the early posttransplant period and improve in the first 1–3 months posttransplant.

The distribution of *CYP3A5* alleles varies significantly by ancestry. The *CYP3A5*3* allele has a high frequency in EAs.^2^ Our analysis was conducted only in those of European ancestry, and most participants (about 88%) carried 2 nonfunctional *CYP3A5*3* alleles (*CYP3A5*3/*3*). About 10.7% of our participants carried 1 nonfunctional *CYP3A5*3* allele (*CYP3A5*1/*3*), which increased tacrolimus CL/F by 81% relative to those with *CYP3A5*3/*3*. As expected, only 0.5% of those enrolled in our study population carried the *CYP3A5*1/*1* genotype and were associated with an increase in tacrolimus CL/F by 205% relative to *CYP3A5*3/*3. CYP3A5*6* and *CYP3A5*7* alleles are usually not present in EAs.^2,26^ Only 1 participant carried *CYP3A5*6*.

The *CYP3A4*22* allele was associated with a reduction in tacrolimus clearance and has a frequency that is higher than other ancestry groups.^30,33,41^ About 8.7% of our enrolled subjects carried 1 nonfunctional *CYP3A4*22* allele (*CYP3A5*22/*1*), which decreased tacrolimus CL/F by 22% relative to subjects carrying *CYP3A4*1/*1*. Only 0.5% of our enrolled subjects carried 2 nonfunctional *CYP3A4*22* alleles (*CYP3A5*22/*22*) that decreased tacrolimus CL/F by 72% relative to subjects carrying *CYP3A4*1/*1*. We previously evaluated the *CYP3A4*22* allele in African American recipients in whom the allele frequency was lower (~4%), and we were unable to detect an association with tacrolimus CL/F, possibly because of the small sample size.^17^

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) gives CYP3A5 and tacrolimus an A level of evidence and categorizes individuals as extensive (*CYP3A5*1/*1*), intermediate (*CYP3A5*1/*3*), or poor (*CYP3A5*3/*3*) metabolizers.^65^ CPIC recommends that CYP3A5 poor metabolizers receive the standard recommended starting dose, whereas extensive or intermediate metabolizers receive 1.5–2 times the standard dose without exceeding 0.3 mg/kg/day^65^ but does not account for clinical factors. Our results in general support these recommendations, but our model includes clinical factors and drugdrug interactions that are well known to change the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, thereby creating a more precise starting dose. CPIC does not provide guidance for *CYP3A4*22*, but our results show that it has a significant effect on tacrolimus clearance and should be considered in dosing decisions. Although rare, carriers of 2 *CYP3A4*22* alleles along with 2 nonfunctional *CYP3A5*3* alleles have profoundly reduced clearance.^31^

The model evaluation techniques including SIR and prediction-corrected visual predictive check (on a log scale; [Figure 2](#F2)) showed that the model is able to adequately predict the observed data. The predictability of the model was further tested by external validation, which showed acceptable bias (ME, 0.49 ng/mL; MPE, 6.5%) and imprecision (population RMSE, 3.09 ng/mL; individual RMSE, 1.73 ng/mL) values for tacrolimus trough concentrations. Although the model slightly overpredicted trough concentrations relative to the observed concentrations (median tacrolimus trough in validation cohort, 8.4 ng/mL), the current analysis reported a population median error of 36.8% and an individual median error of 20.5% with reasonable forecasting of future predictions. Use of the model should be coupled with clinical judgment to account for clinical factors potentially affecting clearance not included in the model.

Prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) on a log scale for the final tacrolimus model. The solid red line represents the median observed trough concentrations (ng/mL; prediction-corrected trough concentration), and the semitransparent red field represents a simulation-based 95% confidence interval for the median. The observed 10th and 90th percentiles are presented with dashed red lines, and the 95% confidence intervals for the corresponding model-predicted percentiles are shown as semitransparent blue fields. The observed trough concentrations (prediction corrected) are represented by open circles. All tacrolimus observed concentrations are trough concentrations.

A limitation to the study is the observational design. The exact times of the tacrolimus troughs were not confirmed with patients. If adherence concerns were noted in the electronic medical record, the trough was not collected or used in the analysis. For all other troughs, we assumed adherence was high. There may also be effects from varying hematocrit levels, rare variants and/or concomitant medications (eg, over-the-counter, neutraceuticals) that affect the clearance of tacrolimus that we have not accounted for.

## Conclusion

Tacrolimus exhibits considerable interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetics in kidney transplant recipients of European ancestry. This study complements our previously published study that demonstrated the importance of population-specific genotypes to better understanding tacrolimus pharmacokinetics.^17^ The current analysis of recipients of genetically confirmed European ancestry, which accounts for variants and clinical factors, provides a tool to preemptively individualize the dose of tacrolimus and ultimately improve clinical immunosuppressant outcomes in kidney transplant recipients.
