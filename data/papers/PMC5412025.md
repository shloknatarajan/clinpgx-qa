## Abstract

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2B6 plays a significant role in the stereo-selective metabolism of (S)-methadone to 2-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, an inactive methadone metabolite. Elevated (S)-methadone can cause cardiotoxicity by prolonging the QT interval of the heart's electrical cycle. Large inter-individual variability of methadone pharmacokinetics causes discordance in the relationship between dose, plasma concentrations and side effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the CYP2B6 gene contributes to a poor metabolizer phenotype for methadone in these fatal cases. The genetic analysis was conducted on 125 Caucasian methadone-only fatalities obtained from the West Virginia and Kentucky Offices of the Chief Medical Examiner. The frequency of eight exonic and intronic SNPs (rs2279344, rs3211371, rs3745274, rs4803419, rs8192709, rs8192719, rs12721655 and rs35979566) was determined. The frequencies of SNPs rs3745274 (*9, c516G > T, Q172H), and rs8192719 (21563 C > T) were enhanced in the methadone-only group. Higher blood methadone concentrations were observed in individuals who were genotyped homozygous for SNP rs3211371 (*5, c1459C > T, R487C). These results indicate that these three CYP2B6 SNPs are associated with methadone fatalities.

## Introduction

Initially discovered and developed in Germany during World War II, methadone is a synthetic µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist that has been used as an analgesic alternative to morphine when it was difficult to obtain ([1](#bkw135C1)–[3](#bkw135C3)). In 1965, methadone was introduced as a treatment regimen of opioid drug dependence or withdrawal symptoms in patients ([1](#bkw135C1)). Nearly a decade later, in 1976, physicians were given permission to prescribe methadone as an analgesic to maintain adequate pain control ([4](#bkw135C4)), for malignant pain in cancer patients and non-malignant pain that continues beyond the normal course of a disease or injury ([5](#bkw135C5), [6](#bkw135C6)).

Methadone is clinically available in the USA only as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the (R)- and (S)-methadone enantiomers ([7](#bkw135C7)–[9](#bkw135C9)). Each enantiomer has specific pharmacodynamic properties. The analgesic properties of methadone are attributed to the (R)-enantiomer, which has a 10-fold greater affinity for the MOR ([10](#bkw135C10), [11](#bkw135C11)) and is 8–50 times more potent than (S)-methadone ([2](#bkw135C2)). As concentrations of (R)-methadone increase above therapeutic levels, negative side effects on MORs in the brainstem respiratory centers can be potentiated, thus mediating respiratory depression ([12](#bkw135C12), [13](#bkw135C13)). On the other hand, elevated (S)-methadone causes cardiotoxicity by prolonging the QT interval and subsequently leads to torsade de pointes by blocking the voltage-gated potassium channel of the human *ether-a-go-go* related gene (hERG) ([14](#bkw135C14), [15](#bkw135C15)). This stereo-selective cardiotoxicity is attributed to (S)-methadone being 3.5 times more potent than (R)-methadone in blocking the hERG channel ([14](#bkw135C14)–[16](#bkw135C16)).

Methadone metabolism occurs primarily through the route of oxidative biotransformation. The principle metabolite, 2-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), is formed during metabolism through an N-demethylation reaction followed by spontaneous cyclization ([11](#bkw135C11), [18](#bkw135C18)–[21](#bkw135C21)). EDDP is further metabolized to 2-ethyl-1,5-methyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EMDP). Neither of these metabolites is pharmacologically active ([18](#bkw135C18), [21](#bkw135C21), [22](#bkw135C22)). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the liver are responsible for the metabolism of methadone, which undergoes stereo-selective N-demethylation ([2](#bkw135C2)). CYP3A4, 2B6 and 2C19 account for majority of the conversion of methadone to EDDP and other inactive metabolites, with minor contributions from CYP2C8, 2D6, 2D8, 2C18 and 3A7 ([8](#bkw135C8), [23](#bkw135C23), [24](#bkw135C24)). (R)-Methadone is preferentially metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP2C19, whereas (S)-methadone is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6 and CYP2D6. CYP3A4 has no stereoselectivity, metabolizing both enantiomers ([8](#bkw135C8), [23](#bkw135C23)).

Methadone is a difficult medication to safely prescribe due to extreme variability in inter-individual pharmacokinetics, making the relationship between dose, plasma concentrations and effects difficult to define ([25](#bkw135C25), [26](#bkw135C26)). This increases the risk of an unexpected death. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, methadone accounts for >30% of prescription opioid deaths, while it only represents 2% of all opioid prescriptions ([http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/MethadoneOverdoses/index.html](http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/MethadoneOverdoses/index.html), last accessed on August, 2016). Much of the inter-individual variability in methadone pharmacokinetics may be due to genetic variations within the genes encoding CYP enzymes responsible for the metabolism of methadone ([27](#bkw135C27)).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic variation in the CYP genes ([28](#bkw135C28), [29](#bkw135C29)). CYP2B6 is a highly polymorphic gene with 53 allelic variants equating to 38 protein variants and a series of subvariants ([30](#bkw135C30), [31](#bkw135C31)), designated *1B to *38 ([http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm](http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm), last accessed on August, 2016). These SNPs are thought to play a role in inter-individual and interethnic differences in the response of drug metabolism by CYP2B6 ([30](#bkw135C30)). It is known that CYP2B6 plays a major role in the biotransformation of many clinically important drugs, such as selegiline ([32](#bkw135C32)), bupropion ([33](#bkw135C33)), efavirenz ([34](#bkw135C34)), artemether ([35](#bkw135C35)) and methadone ([14](#bkw135C14)–[16](#bkw135C16)). These studies demonstrated that some allelic variants (e.g., rs2279344, rs3211371, rs3745274, rs4803419, rs8192709, rs8192719, rs12721655 and rs35979566) lead to a decreased expression or decreased enzyme activity of CYP2B6.

Several pharmacogenetic studies have been previously conducted involving methadone-related deaths or patients in a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program. However, these studies did not include cases where only methadone was detected; rather, those studies used mixed drug cases and/or had small sample sizes ([14](#bkw135C14), [15](#bkw135C15), [17](#bkw135C17)). The present work is unique because we genotyped and analyzed CYP2B6 variants in 125 Caucasians involved with methadone-only fatalities. Eight key SNP variants present in the Caucasian population were genotyped to test for enrichment. The analyzes performed in this study were aimed to provide insight into the association of CYP2B6 SNPs in individuals who succumb to methadone intoxication in the methadone-only cases. Because exonic variants cause amino acid substitutions, which can affect the enzymatic activity and intronic regions, are responsible for splicing, frameshifting and binding microRNAs, SNPs in both of these regions were examined to determine their association with methadone toxicity in the study population.

## Material and methods

### Chemicals and enzymes

QIAamp DNA Micro extraction kits were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA). Absolute ethanol was purchased from Pharmco-Aaper (Shelbyville, KY, USA). MicroAmp Optical 96-well Reaction Plates, 96-well Fast PCR Plates, MicroAmp Optical Adhesive Film, TaqMan Univeral PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG and Taqman SNP Genotyping Assays were purchased from Life Technologies^TM^ (Foster City, CA, USA). Tris base, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

### Sample collection

The characteristics of all of the samples used and studied in the paper were described in a previous study on methadone pharmacogenetics ([36](#bkw135C36)). Briefly, the cases for this study were derived from fatalities due to methadone occurring from 2003 to 2008 in the Offices of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCMEs) of West Virginia (WV) and Kentucky (KY). Based on the toxicity criteria, 125 Caucasian cases (78 from WV and 47 from KY) related to methadone-only fatalities were selected. A control group of 255 cases was obtained from the WV OCME, in which toxicology immunoassays were negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, cocaine, methadone, propoxyphene, opiates, oxycodone and tricyclic antidepressants. Demographic data for the WV cases, along with the number of KY cases are outlined in Table [I](#bkw135TB1).

### DNA extraction

Following the manufacturer's protocol for dried blood spots, QIAamp DNA Micro extraction kits were used for the purification of genomic DNA from blood stain cards prepared by the WV and KY OCMEs. Extractions were performed in triplicate in order to increase overall genomic DNA yields; the three DNA solutions were pooled and then concentrated by passage over a MiniElute column. Extracted DNA was quantitated by absorbance spectrophotometry on a NanoDrop 1000. Samples were diluted to a concentration of 1.78 ng/µL with Tris-EDTA buffer to a final volume of 100 µL for use in the SNP genotyping assays. All genomic DNA samples, initial extractions and 1.78 ng/µL working solutions, were stored at 4°C.

### SNP selection

Eight different SNPs within the CYP2B6 gene were genotyped. Five exonic SNPs, rs3211371 (*5, c1459C > T, R487C), rs3745274 (*9, c516G > T, Q172H), rs8192709 (*2, c64C > T, R22C), rs12721655 (*8, c415A > G, K139E) and rs35979566 (*15, c1172T > A, I391N), were selected because they were considered polymorphic in the Caucasian population, and known to encode non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. The remaining three SNPs, rs2279344 (18273 G > A), rs4803419 (15582 C > T) and rs8192719 (21563 C > T), were intronic and had Minor Allele Frequencies (MAFs) of at least 5%.

### SNP genotyping

The following Life Technologies^TM^ TaqMan SNP Genotyping kits were used to determine CYP2B6 genotypes: (i) C__26823974_30 (rs2279344), (ii) C__30634242_40 (rs3211371), (iii) C___7817765_60 (rs3745274), (iv) C___7817764_10 (rs4803419), (v) C___2818162_20 (rs8192709), (vi) C__22275631_10 (rs8192719), (vii) C__30634236_20 (rs12721655) and (viii) C__33845840_20 (rs35979566). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and allelic discrimination were carried out in a total volume of a 25-µL reaction, containing 20 ng of genomic DNA, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG (1X) and a Taqman SNP Genotyping Assay (1X). PCR parameters were set for polymerase activation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles (rs2279344, rs3211371, rs3745274, rs4803419 and rs8192709) or 55 cycles (rs8192719) of denaturation at 92°C for 30 s and annealing/extension for 90 s at 60°C for each SNP on an ABI7000 Sequence Detection System. SNP rs12721655 and rs35979566 were genotyped on an ABI StepOnePlus^TM^ Instrument using the RT-PCR parameters of 95°C for 10 min followed by 65 cycles of 92°C for 15 s and 60°C for 90 s. All SNP genotypes were determined using both the auto and manual allele call options on their respective instrument software.

### Statistical analysis

Allele frequencies for the control and methadone-only groups were calculated based on the allelic calls for all SNPs in each group. A *χ*^2^ test with two degrees of freedom was used to assess the differences between the MAFs in the control group and the MAFs reported in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) dbSNP database for the Caucasian population and between the control study group and the methadone-only fatality study group. *P*-values < 0.05 were considered to statistically significant. We also assessed whether genotypic frequencies for each SNP were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using a *χ*^2^ test with two degrees of freedom.

When performing the statistical analysis on the blood methadone concentrations and [methadone]/[EDDP] ratio, the methadone-only group was further divided into two groups. All 125 fatalities due to methadone were used for the analysis of blood methadone concentrations, while only the cases obtained from the WV OCME were used for the analysis of [methadone]/[EDDP] ratios (the KY OCME did not determine EDDP concentrations, hence the [methadone]/[EDDP] ratio data were not available). The blood methadone concentration measurements were conducted by the OCMEs during the toxicological testing, and therefore, represent both the (R)- and (S)- methadone concentrations combined. The mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean (SEM) and unpaired *t*-test with Welch's correction or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey test correction was used to compare blood methadone concentrations (mg/L) between homozygotes for the major allele (ancestral), heterozygotes and homozygotes for the minor allele (variant) in WV/KY methadone-only cases. The same tests were also performed to compare [methadone]/[EDDP] ratio between ancestral, heterozygotes and variant alleles in then WV methadone-only cases. One-way ANOVA analyses were performed only on groups that had a minimum number of two cases for each genotype; an unpaired *t*-test with Welch's correction was performed in all other cases. Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 6 software version 6.02.

### VEP of non-synonymous SNP variants

The consequences of the exonic SNPs were predicted using the online Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) tool on EnsemlGenomes ([http://useast.ensembl.org/Tools/VEP](http://useast.ensembl.org/Tools/VEP)). SIFT and PolyPhen scores were obtained by inputting and running the variant identifiers for Human (Homo sapiens) on VEP.

## Results

Using the data from the allelic discrimination analysis, genotypic and MAFs were calculated for the eight SNPs in all groups (Table [II](#bkw135TB2)). Two SNPs, rs12721655 (MAF 0.8%) and rs35979566 (MAF 0.8%), were not included in the comparison between blood methadone concentration and [methadone]/[EDDP] ratio because the variant allele was not observed in the methadone-only group.

### HWE analysis

Genotype frequencies within a group were considered to be in HWE if the resulting *χ*^2^ value was <5.99 (corresponding to a *P*-value > 0.05). SNP rs8192709 in the control group was out of HWE. The remaining five SNPs were in HWE for the control group. The methadone-only group was within HWE for all six SNPs.

### Comparison of observed and expected genotypic frequencies

To assess for significant differences between the genotypic frequencies in the control groups and the NCBI frequencies for the Caucasian population, a *χ*^2^ test with two degrees of freedom was used. We observed that the genotypic frequency of four SNPs (rs3745274, rs4803419, rs8192709 and rs8192719) was significantly different between our control group and that of the frequency in the NCBI population. SNPs rs3745274 and rs8192719 in the control group had lower than expected MAFs compared to NCBI reported values, 22.4% vs 27.0% and 23.0% vs 27.9%, respectively, while SNPs rs4803419 and rs8192709 observed higher MAFs, 31.1% vs 25.1% and 5.4% vs 3.6%, respectively.

Since many of the control group SNP frequencies were discordant with the NCBI frequencies, we relied on genotype frequencies of the local control group to identify SNPs that could contribute to methadone toxicity. SNPs rs3745274 and rs8192719 exhibited a significant difference in the methadone-only group compared to the control group. For these two SNPs, the minor allele frequency in the methadone-only cases was greater than that of the control group, 31.9% vs 22.4% and 33.6% vs 23.0%, respectively. When assessing the observed and expected genotypic frequencies for the male and female groups, the differences in frequencies were preserved in the both groups. These results are delineated in Table [II](#bkw135TB2).

### Analysis of blood methadone concentrations and [methadone]/[EDDP] ratios

We tested for associations between SNP genotypes and blood methadone concentrations using a one-way ANOVA, in conjunction with the Tukey test. For SNP rs3211371, these analyzes showed a significant increase in the mean blood methadone concentrations (mg/L) in participants carrying two copies of the variant allele (1.67 ± 0.85) as compared to either the heterozygote (0.52 ± 0.08) or homozygous ancestral genotype (0.59 ± 0.05). Figure [1](#bkw135F1)A depicts the mean blood methadone concentrations, with SEM, of each of the genotypes for the SNPs tested. The metabolic ratio of [Methadone]/[EDDP] was significantly lower in heterozygotes carrying the rs8192709 variant vs the homozygous ancestral genotype (Figure [1](#bkw135F1)B). No significant differences in ratios were observed for the remaining SNPs.

### Predicted effects of SNPs on protein function

Amino acid substitution (AAS) at the corresponding positions for each of the SNPs were predicted for their effect on protein function. VEP reports the possible impact of the SNPs using the SIFT and PolyPhen algorithms. Both algorithms were consistent for rs3211371 and rs3745274, indicating that the AASs were tolerated and benign, while rs12721655 was predicted to affect the protein function in a deleterious and possibly damaging manner. Conflicting results were observed for rs8192709 and rs35979566, where the SIFT algorithm predicted the AASs to have a deleterious effect on the protein function, while PolyPhen predicted the substitutions to be benign.

## Discussion

After oral administration, methadone can be detected in the blood within 15–45 min, and peak plasma concentrations can be attained at 2.5–4 h. The bioavailability of methadone is ~75%, with a wide range of 36–100% ([2](#bkw135C2), [8](#bkw135C8), [37](#bkw135C37)). About 86% of methadone binds to α_1_-acid glycoprotein (AGP), leaving 14% as free plasma methadone levels ([8](#bkw135C8)). The methadone levels in the plasma decrease as the liver enzymes, CYP450s, start to metabolize methadone to the inactive metabolites EDDP and EMDP. The elimination half-life of methadone ranges from 5 to 130 h, with a mean value of 22 h ([37](#bkw135C37)). The pharmacokinetics of methadone encompasses extreme inter-individual variability attributed to factors such as, age, co-administered medications, disease, ethnicity (due to differing allelic frequency of genetic polymorphisms), gender and weight ([8](#bkw135C8), [27](#bkw135C27), [36](#bkw135C36)). In a previous study, Richards-Waugh *et al*. ([36](#bkw135C36)) demonstrated that an increasing number of SNPs present in CYP3A4 was associated with an increasing blood level of methadone.

Due to the number of factors contributing to the pharmacokinetics of methadone, this study examined CYP2B6 SNPs in 125 Caucasian individuals who suffered methadone-only fatalities. This eliminated the factors of co-medication and limited it to the allelic frequency of the Caucasian population in WV and KY. The methadone-only group was a non-random selection of individuals, chosen for the study based on a particular phenotype (fatalities due to methadone) of interest in the WV and KY region. In order to accurately determine any differences in the genotypic frequencies of the SNPs, the methadone-only group was compared to the regional control group. SNPs rs12721655 and rs35979566 did not exhibit any of the variant alleles in the methadone group or the control group. This could be accredited to the low MAF of 0.8%. The study cohort may not have been large enough to reasonably observe the variant allele. The remaining alleles genotyped had a MAF of at least 2% as reported by the NCBI database. A significant enrichment of the minor alleles of rs3745274 and rs8192719 was observed in the methadone-only group compared to the control group, (32.2% vs 22.4% and 33.6% vs 23.0%), for the SNPs, respectively. The data suggests that these SNP may play a causative role in methadone fatalities. This finding is consistent with the observation that rs3745274 and rs8192719 are under-represented in a group of individuals with low (S)-methadone levels ([14](#bkw135C14)) and suggesting their involvement with decreased CYP2B6 activity. The significant increase in the number of minor alleles was preserved in both the male and female cases, indicating that a particular gender does not have a predisposition to the mutation.

It is unclear if the enrichment of the minor alleles rs3745274 and rs8192719 leads to an enhancement of the blood level of (S)-methadone in this study, as enantiomer levels of (R)- and (S)-methadone were not determined at the time of autopsy. While total methadone blood levels were not increased by the presence of these SNPs (Figure [1](#bkw135F1)A), the ratio of (R)- to (S)-methadone is unknown. If the ratio of (S)-methadone was increased due to these SNPs, then it is possible that an increased risk of death from cardiotoxicity would exist.

Parent-to-metabolite ratios are commonly used as an indicator of a recent intake of certain drugs and are not necessarily indicative of an acute poisoning. In some cases, the metabolic ratio may provide clues to indicate reduced metabolism of the drug due to a drug interaction or low metabolic capacity caused by genetics ([38](#bkw135C38)). It was interesting to see a significant decrease (*P* = 0.04) in the metabolic ratio in individuals that were heterozygous for rs8192709. These data suggests that rs8192709 may have a role in the metabolizing methadone at a faster rate. This analysis, however, should be interpreted with caution, as the number of individuals having a variant was minimal (*n* = 2), and neither were observed to be homozygous for the variant. A significant increase in the blood methadone concentration was observed for rs3211371 of homozygous variant alleles when compared to the ancestral alleles and the heterozygous genotypes (*P* = 0.002). This finding suggests that rs3211371 results in the reduced activity of CYP2B6. This finding is contrary to the findings of Dobrinas, *et al*. ([14](#bkw135C14)). In their study, rs3211371 was over-represented in low-level (S)-methadone groups, indicating an increased CYP2B6 activity. This study interprets the findings based on the various genotypes, whereas Dobrinas, *et al*. ([14](#bkw135C14)) interprets their findings on MAFs, which may be the reason of the contradictory postulations. Also, Dobrinas *et al*. ([14](#bkw135C14)) measured enantiomeric levels of methadone in live MMT patients, while our results are from autopsy samples. It is also possible that the small sample size of the studies has resulted in these differences. Additional numbers of cases could be needed to resolve this difference in findings. A combination of the total number of variant alleles present for all of the SNPs tested for each individual in the methadone-only group was determined. The blood methadone concentration and the [methadone]/[EDDP] ratio was compared to total number of minor alleles present, ranging from one to five copies of the variant alleles for CYP2B6. The data (not shown) did not support the assumption that multiple SNPs, rather than a single SNP, on the CYP2B6 gene would increase the unexpected fatality from methadone.

SNP rs3211371 results in a conversion of arginine to cysteine at amino acid Position 487, while glutamine is converted to histidine at amino acid Position 172 as a result of rs3745274. Tools for annotating functional predictions of coding non-synonymous SNPs, such as SIFT and PolyPhen, suggested that both of these SNPs are tolerated or benign. On the other hand, rs8192709 encodes a conversion of arginine to cysteine at amino acid Position 22, producing disagreeing predictions, where SIFT reports the variation to be deleterious, while PolyPhen predicts the mutation to be benign. CYP2B6 has six substrate recognition sites (SRSs) along its sequence ([39](#bkw135C39)). Rs3211371, rs3745274 and rs8192709 are not located within the known SRSs and confer minimal effects on methadone binding; however the SNPs may affect the hydrophobicity and conformation of the protein, resulting in alteration of the metabolic rate ([40](#bkw135C40)). Furthermore, rs3745274 has been associated with increased levels of a hepatic splicing variant lacking exon 4–6 and decreased protein levels, caused by erroneous splicing, leading to decreased metabolism of substrates ([41](#bkw135C41), [42](#bkw135C42)).

Physiologic differences occur between genders, which may affect the outcome of drug activity ([43](#bkw135C43)). Gender influences the expression of CYPs and transporters, thus influencing pharmacokinetic parameters ([44](#bkw135C44)). Methadone accesses MOR site through the bloodstream, coming in contact with the plasma protein AGP. AGP is capable of binding methadone and rendering it inactive ([45](#bkw135C45)). In general, females have a significantly greater binding capacity of AGP than males, suggesting that females could have a reduced level of free plasma drug levels ([46](#bkw135C46)). In this study, there were no significant differences in the blood methadone concentration or the [methadone]/[EDDP] ratio between the male and female groups for any of the SNPs tested (data not shown).

It is important to note that since these cases were obtained from the WV and KY OCMEs, the medical and prescription history of the deceased individuals was not available. It is possible that drugs, prescription or natural supplements, or environmental compounds not detected by the normal toxicology screens could also have contributed to altered methadone metabolism. Additionally, it is unclear if the ratio of (R)- to (S)-methadone was changed in association with any CYP2B6 SNPs examined. Research is currently underway to determine the effects of the exonic SNPs included in this study on the differential metabolism of (R)- and (S)-methadone.

## Conclusions

The frequencies of two SNPs on the CYP2B6 gene, rs3745274 (*9, c516G > T, Q172H) and rs8192719 (21563 C > T) were significantly increased in the methadone-only group. SNP rs3211371 exhibited a significant increase in the blood methadone concentration in the homozygous variant genotype, indicating that an individual carrying two copies of the minor allele for the SNP could have a poor methadone-metabolizer phenotype leading to an increased risk of fatal methadone intoxication. CYP2B6 only plays a partial role in the metabolism of (S)-methadone, and therefore the SNPs on this gene are only a part of the whole story. Richards-Waugh *et al*. ([36](#bkw135C36)) studied the effects of SNPs on the CYP3A4 gene, which metabolizes both the (R)- and (S)- forms of methadone. It is possible that it is a combination of SNPs on both genes that leads to these unexpected fatalities.
