## Abstract

**Aims:** 
A large interindividual variability in plasma concentrations has been reported in patients treated with donepezil, the most frequently prescribed antidementia drug. We aimed to evaluate clinical and genetic factors influencing donepezil disposition in a patient population recruited from a naturalistic setting.

**Methods:** 
A population pharmacokinetic study was performed including data from 129 older patients treated with donepezil. The patients were genotyped for common polymorphisms in the metabolic enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A, in the electron transferring protein POR and the nuclear factor NR1I2 involved in CYP activity and expression, and in the drug transporter ABCB1.

**Results:** 
The average donepezil clearance was 7.3 l h−1 with a 30% interindividual variability. Gender markedly influenced donepezil clearance (P < 0.01). Functional alleles of CYP2D6 were identified as unique significant genetic covariate for donepezil clearance (P < 0.01), with poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers demonstrating, respectively, a 32% slower and a 67% faster donepezil elimination compared with extensive metabolizers.

**Conclusion:** 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of donepezil were well described by the developed population model. Functional alleles of CYP2D6 significantly contributed to the variability in donepezil disposition in the patient population and should be further investigated in the context of individual dose optimization to improve clinical outcome and tolerability of the treatment.

### Aims

A large interindividual variability in plasma concentrations has been reported in patients treated with donepezil, the most frequently prescribed antidementia drug. We aimed to evaluate clinical and genetic factors influencing donepezil disposition in a patient population recruited from a naturalistic setting.

### Methods

A population pharmacokinetic study was performed including data from 129 older patients treated with donepezil. The patients were genotyped for common polymorphisms in the metabolic enzymes *CYP2D6* and *CYP3A*, in the electron transferring protein *POR* and the nuclear factor *NR1I2* involved in CYP activity and expression, and in the drug transporter *ABCB1*.

### Results

The average donepezil clearance was 7.3 l h^−1^ with a 30% interindividual variability. Gender markedly influenced donepezil clearance (*P* < 0.01). Functional alleles of *CYP2D6* were identified as unique significant genetic covariate for donepezil clearance (*P* < 0.01), with poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers demonstrating, respectively, a 32% slower and a 67% faster donepezil elimination compared with extensive metabolizers.

### Conclusion

The pharmacokinetic parameters of donepezil were well described by the developed population model. Functional alleles of *CYP2D6* significantly contributed to the variability in donepezil disposition in the patient population and should be further investigated in the context of individual dose optimization to improve clinical outcome and tolerability of the treatment.

## Introduction

Donepezil (Aricept®, Pfizer) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor widely used in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase increases the level of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and thus compensates the cholinergic deficit observed in AD pathology. Cholinergic adverse events (AE) are common and include gastrointestinal problems, insomnia, fatigue and muscle cramps [[1](#b1)]. Several studies reported a large variability in drug response to donepezil among AD patients [[2](#b2),[3](#b3)] which might partly be due to the observed interindividual differences in plasma concentrations of the drug [[4](#b4)]. Thus, in elderly patients, the presence of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy resulting in drug–drug interactions might lead to changes in plasma concentrations. In addition, these differences could also be triggered by genetic variations in metabolic enzymes and transporters.

Donepezil is excreted unchanged in urine (<20%), oxidized in the liver by the cytochromes P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A, and conjugated with glucuronic acid [[5](#b5)]. 6-*O*-desmethyl-donepezil is the only active metabolite with potency in acetylcholinesterase inhibition comparable with donepezil. It is, however, only present at a 20% level of the parent drug [[5](#b5)]. Co-administration of drugs inhibiting CYP2D6 and CYP3A has been found to interact with donepezil metabolism *in vitro* and to increase plasma concentrations of donepezil *in vivo*. However, the clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown [[1](#b1),[6](#b6),[7](#b7)].

Phenotypically, four types of CYP2D6 metabolizers can be distinguished: poor (PM), intermediate (IM), extensive (EM) and ultrarapid (UM) metabolizers. Underlying genetic variations defining the CYP2D6 phenotypes are well known [[8](#b8)]. One clinical trial reported a non-significant influence of the *CYP2D6* genotype on donepezil plasma concentrations [[4](#b4)]. However, this study enrolled a small number of subjects (*n* = 42) without any PM. Several studies also investigated the influence of genetic variations in *CYP2D6* on the response to donepezil treatment. Although discrepant, results from these studies suggest that patients with *CYP2D6* genotypes associated with no or low activity (i.e. leading to higher plasma concentrations) may have better clinical outcomes [[9](#b9)–[12](#b12)].

The predictive information of genetic variations in *CYP3A* on enzyme activity is more limited [[13](#b13)]. CYP3A stands for a group of isozymes, namely CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP3A7, which have a large overlap in substrate specificity. A clinical trial investigated the association of different *CYP3A4/5* polymorphisms on plasma concentrations and the therapeutic outcome of donepezil. The results suggest no major impact of genetic variants in *CYP3A4/5* on donepezil metabolism [[14](#b14)]. Furthermore, donepezil is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [[15](#b15)], a membrane transporter implicated in drug absorption, distribution and excretion. Several polymorphisms in the *ABCB1* gene, coding for P-gp, have been shown to influence its activity [[16](#b16)]. In the above mentioned study, no significant effect of *ABCB1* polymorphisms on donepezil concentrations was observed [[14](#b14)].

Genetic variations in genes other than *CYP3A4/5/7* could influence CYP3A activity. The cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is a protein that transfers electrons from NADPH to microsomal CYP enzymes and might, therefore, be a general limiting factor for drug metabolizing capacity [[17](#b17)]. Many polymorphisms in the *POR* have been described, some of them changing the activity of the enzyme *in vitro*. The results of an *in vivo* study suggest a 1.6-fold increase in CYP3A activity among homozygous carriers of the common *POR*28* allele [[17](#b17)]. Furthermore, the Pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulates the expression of detoxifying drug-metabolic enzymes and transporters, including CYP3A4 and P-gp [[18](#b18)]. PXR is a nuclear receptor encoded by the *NR1I2* gene and is activated by a variety of xenobiotics and endogenous ligands. *In vitro* studies revealed genetic variants in the regulatory region of *NR1I2* associated with inducible and constitutive CYP3A4 expression [[19](#b19),[20](#b20)].

In the present population pharmacokinetic study, we quantified the effects of genetic variations in *CYP2D6*, *CYP3A4/5/7*, *POR*, *NR1I2* and *ABCB1*, and of other clinical factors, on donepezil plasma concentrations in a group of 129 older patients. In addition, simulations were performed to compare predicted average plasma concentrations (*C*_av_) associated with a 10 mg once daily dosage regimen for relevant patients' genotypes. Finally, the donepezil concentration–toxicity and genotype–toxicity relationships were analyzed.

## Methods

### Study population and study design

A total of 129 patients receiving donepezil for at least 1 month were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Patients were recruited at four hospitals in Switzerland (Lausanne, Geneva, Marsens, Aigle) and in affiliated nursing homes. The sample consisted of 89% inpatients and 11% outpatients. One blood sampling was performed to measure donepezil plasma concentration, to evaluate renal and hepatic function (creatinine, urea, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin on Cobas Integra, Roche-Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), to measure plasma protein concentrations (α_1_-acid glycoprotein and albumin on Cobas Integra), and to extract DNA for the genetic analyses. The presence of any AEs, reported by the patients, doctors and/or nurses, was registered at the time of inclusion. Additionally, concomitant diseases, co-medication, consumption of grapefruit, alcohol and tobacco were recorded.

The study was approved by the local ethics committees (Lausanne University Hospital, Geneva University Hospital, Cantonal Ethics Committee Fribourg) and conducted according to Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent, including consent for genetic analyses, was obtained from all patients or their legal representative.

### Drug concentration measurement

Blood samples were collected in EDTA blood tubes. After centrifugation, the plasma was stored at −20°C until analysis. Donepezil plasma concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, as previously described [[21](#b21)]. The analytical method was validated according to international guidelines with the following assessments and results for donepezil: trueness (CV −8 to +11%), precision (CV repeatability: 1.5 to 4.9%, CV intermediate precision: 4.0 to 8.5%), selectivity and matrix effects (CV donepezil <5%) [[21](#b21)]. An isotope-labelled internal standard was used and the validated range for donepezil comprised 2–300 ng ml^−1^ [[21](#b21)].

### Genotyping

Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood samples with the FlexiGene DNA extraction kit and the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The following SNPs were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction with 5′-nuclease allelic discrimination assays (ABI PRISM 7000; Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) according to previous studies [[17](#b17),[22](#b22),[23](#b23)] or manufacturer's instructions: *CYP2D6*3* (rs35742686, 2549delA, P/N: 4312554), *CYP2D6*4* (rs3892097, 1846G>A, P/N: 4312555), *CYP2D6*6* (rs5030655, 1707delT, P/N: 4312556), *CYP3A4**1B (rs2740574, −392A>G) *CYP3A4* rs4646437 C ≥ T (intron 7, C__32306227_10), *CYP3A4**22 (rs35599367, 15389C>T, C__59013445_10), *CYP3A5*3* (rs776746, 6986A>G), *CYP3A7*1C* (-262T>A and −270T>G)*, POR**28 (rs1057868, 1508C>T, C__8890131_30), *NR1I2* rs1523130 (C__9152783_20), *NR1I2* rs2472677 (C__26079845_10), *NR1I2* rs7643645, (C__1834250_10), *ABCB1* 2677G>T (rs2032582), *ABCB1* 3435C>T (rs1045642), *ABCB1* 1236C>T (rs1128503)*.* Gene deletion (*CYP2D6**5, Hs00010001_cn) and duplication/multiplication (*CYP2D6**xN) were analyzed by TaqMan copy number assay and long PCR [[24](#b24)], respectively.

### Model-based pharmacokinetic analysis

#### Structural model

The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonmem® (version 7.2) [[25](#b25)] with the PSN-toolkit (version 3.4.2) [[26](#b26)]. Different disposition models were tested to fit the data at best. Exponential errors following a log-normal distribution were used to describe the interpatient variability and proportional, additive and mixed error models were compared to describe the intrapatient (residual) variability. Because donepezil was administered orally, apparent donepezil clearance (CL/*F*) and volume of distribution (*V*/*F*) were estimated (*F* = bioavailability).

#### Covariate model

Available covariates were gender, age, race, alcohol and grapefruit consumptions, smoking status, renal and liver function tests (creatinine, urea, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin), creatinine clearance (CL_cr_ estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula [[27](#b27)]), plasma protein concentrations (α_1_-acid glycoprotein, albumin) and co-medications (classified as strong or moderate inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, Table [1](#tbl1)) [[28](#b28),[29](#b29)]. The covariate analysis was performed using a stepwise insertion/deletion approach. Visual inspection of the correlation between *post hoc* individual estimates of the PK parameters and the available covariates was first conducted. Potentially influential non-genetic factors were then incorporated sequentially in the models. Polymorphisms in the genes listed in Table [1](#tbl1) were tested for their impact on donepezil CL by categorizing patients into genotypic groups (Reference allele, heterozygote or homozygote mutated) or into predicted phenotypic groups for CYP2D6 (PM, heterozygote extensive (hetEM), homozygote extensive (homEM) and UM metabolizers). CL values were then estimated for each genotype/phenotype (rich model) and/or for further regrouped (reduced model) sub-populations with similar estimated CL values.

#### Parameter estimation and model selection

The data were fitted by use of the first order conditional method with interaction using nonmem® [[25](#b25)]. The log-likelihood ratio test, based on change in the objective function value (ΔOFV), was employed to discriminate between hierarchical models. Because a ΔOFV between any two models approximates a χ^2^ distribution, a decrease of the objective function was considered statistically significant if it exceeded 3.84 (*P* < 0.05) and 6.63 (*P* < 0.01) points for one additional parameter, respectively, for model-building and backward-deletion steps. Diagnostic goodness-of-fit plots and precision of the parameter estimates were used to assess the reliability of the results. Sensitivity analyses were performed to exclude a leverage effect of potential outliers.

#### Model validation and simulation

The final model stability was assessed by the bootstrap method implemented in the PsN-Toolkit (v 3.4.2) [[26](#b26)]. Two thousand data sets were reconstructed by re-sampling from the original data to compute mean parameters values with their 95% confidential intervals (CI) to which the original model fit estimations were compared. In addition, the final model with variability was used to simulate 1000 individuals with different CYP2D6 phenotypes after the administration of 10 mg daily in order to calculate the average concentration time profile with 95% prediction interval (PI). Average *C*_av_ with 95% PI were derived for each metabolic group and compared with the suggested therapeutic range of 30–75 ng ml^−1^ [[30](#b30)]. The figures were generated with GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, [http://www.graphpad.com](http://www.graphpad.com)).

### Concentration/CYP2D6 phenotypes-adverse events analyses

The relationship between log-transformed individual estimates of donepezil area under the curve (AUC) and *C*_av_ and AEs was investigated by logistic regression analyses. AUC_0–τ_ was obtained using Dose/CL_ind_ and *C*_av_ derived as AUC_0–τ_/τ, with τ = 12 or 24 h. Group comparisons between the presence of AEs and predicted CYP2D6 phenotypes were performed with the Fisher's exact test, while a *t*-test was performed to compare the average *C*_av_ in the phenotypic groups using the log-transformed value. The analyses were performed on STATA software (Version 11.2, StataCorp, College Station, USA). A *P* value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results

A total of 129 patients, receiving a donepezil dose of 5 mg (*n* = 45) or 10 mg (*n* = 82) once daily, or 5 mg twice per day (*n* = 2), were included in the study and contributed each with a unique concentration to the dataset. Blood samples were collected on average 14 h after medication intake (range 1–28 h). The average (±SD) duration of treatment was 1.9 (±1.7) years (range 1 month to 8 years). The measured donepezil steady-state plasma concentrations ranged from 8 to 129 ng ml^−1^. The characteristics of the study population are presented in Table [1](#tbl1).

### Structural model

A one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination adequately described the data, while no improvement was achieved using a two compartment disposition model (ΔOFV ≥ −0.56). Owing to the limited amount of samples collected during the absorption phase, the *K*_a_ could not be precisely estimated and was thus fixed to 1.3 h^−1^ to reach peak concentrations 3–4 h after drug intake in accordance with the literature [[31](#b31)]. The association of the inter-individual variability to *V* or *K*_a_, in addition to CL, did not improve the model fit (ΔOFV ≥ −1.1). Finally an additive error model was assigned to estimate the intrapatient residual variability. The parameter estimates with interpatient variability (CV%) of the basic pharmacokinetic model were a CL of 7.3 l h^−1^ (30%), a *V* of 301 l and a *K*_a_ of 1.3 h^−1^.

### Covariate analyses

The model-building steps for the donepezil covariate analyses are summarized in Table [2](#tbl2). Univariate analyses were first performed testing available non-genetic covariates (Table [1](#tbl1)). The analyses revealed a significant influence of gender (ΔOFV = −9.7, *P* = 0.0018) on donepezil CL, suggesting a 17% decrease in female compared with male patients. All the remaining demographic, environmental and physiologic characteristics were not associated with donepezil pharmacokinetics (ΔOFV ≥ −2.8, *P* ≥ 0.09).

Table 2 Caption: Summary of the models used to examine the influence of patient covariates on donepezil CL

Six patients (5%) were taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors and 65 (50%) were receiving moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors [[28](#b28),[29](#b29)]. With the exception of one CYP2D6 PM, all these patients were genotyped as CYP2D6 EMs. We considered that the patient with a PM status did not receive a CYP2D6 inhibitor, because in PMs no CYP2D6 enzyme is expressed. Moreover, two patients (2%) were receiving strong and 37 (29%) moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Finally, CYP3A inducers were administered to four patients (3%) [[28](#b28),[29](#b29)]. The univariate analyses revealed that co-administered strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (ΔOFV = −5.9, *P* < 0.02) and inducers (ΔOFV = −5.6, *P* < 0.02) decreased and increased donepezil CL by 13% and 45%, respectively, while CYP2D6 inhibitors did not affect donepezil kinetics (ΔOFV = −0.7, *P* = 0.4). One patient exhibiting a very high donepezil plasma concentration received two moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (quetiapine and fluoxetine) and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (fluoxetine), and another patient presenting a very low donepezil plasma concentration was taking a CYP3A4 inducer (prednisone). To exclude a positive result for the CYP3A4 co-medication effect based on these potential outliers, a sensitivity analysis was performed removing in turn these two patients from the dataset. The results of this sensitivity analysis showed that the CYP3A4 co-medication effect on donepezil CL did not remain statistically significant anymore and therefore these covariates were not retained in the final model. It appeared that the PM patient with the lowest plasma level strongly affected the precision of the parameter estimate and was thus removed from the rest of the analysis.

Univariate analyses evaluating the influence of several common polymorphisms in *CYP2D6*, *CYP3A4/5/7*, *POR*, *NR1I2* and *ABCB1* on donepezil CL have been performed (Table [1](#tbl1)). Genotype frequencies are in line with previous reports in Caucasian populations [[17](#b17),[19](#b19),[22](#b22),[23](#b23),[32](#b32),[33](#b33)]. No deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed (*P* ≥ 0.05), with the exception of CYP3A7*1C (*P* = 0.003), for which the deviation is possibly due to the small sample size. Among the evaluated genetic polymorphisms, only the CYP2D6 phenotypes (PM *n* = 6; hetEM *n* = 55; homEM *n* = 65; UM *n* = 2) significantly affected donepezil CL (ΔOFV = −17.8, *P* < 0.001).

No statistically significant difference in CL was observed between the CYP2D6 hetEM and homEM phenotypes compared with the rich model in which a CL was assigned in each CYP2D6 genotypic group (ΔOFV = −2.7, *P* = 0.1). The CYP2D6 hetEM and homEM patients were thus included in a unique EM group. Because gender and CYP2D6 polymorphisms were not discarded through multivariate analyses and backward-deletion step, they were both retained in the final pharmacokinetic model and explained 11% of its overall variability. The final model parameter estimates and bootstrap estimations are given in Table [3](#tbl3). The model was considered reliable because the obtained parameter estimates were within the bootstrap 95% CI. Our results suggest that donepezil CL is reduced by 18% (95% CI 10, 26) in female with respect to male individuals. Estimated average CLs were 5.8, 8.6 and 14.3 l h^−1^ for CYP2D6 PMs, EMs and UMs, suggesting that PMs and UMs have, respectively, a decrease of 32% (95% CI 10, 51) and an increase of 67% (95%CI 28, 106) in donepezil CL compared with EM individuals. Figure [1](#fig01) shows the dose-normalized concentration–time plot of donepezil with the 95% PI.

Donepezil dose-normalized plasma concentration–time plots of male (black symbols) and female (white symbols) patients (circles represent extensive CP2D6 metabolizers; squares, poor metabolizers; triangles, ultrarapid metabolizers; star, the PM patient with very low drug concentration excluded from the final model parameters estimations). Simulations were performed for male patients, extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers and receiving 10 mg of donepezil per day (solid line represents average population prediction value; dashed lines, 95% prediction intervals)

### Simulations

Model-based simulations were performed to evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphism on donepezil *C*_av_ for a 10 mg daily regimen and to compare these concentrations with the suggested therapeutic range of 30–75 ng ml^−1^ [[30](#b30)]. The simulated average *C*_av_ was 51 ng ml^−1^ (95% CI 24, 77 ng ml^−1^) in EMs, 73 ng ml^−1^ (95% CI 33, 114 ng ml^−1^) in PMs and 30 ng ml^−1^ (95% CI 15, 46 ng ml^−1^) in UMs, suggesting a 43% increase and a 41% decrease in average *C*_av_ for CYP2D6 PMs and UMs with respect to EM patients. While considering the interindividual variability in CL, CYP2D6 UMs are not expected to exceed the 75 ng ml^−1^ upper limit, whereas it is expected that 43% and 6% of PMs and EMs, respectively, would present average concentrations beyond this threshold. In contrast, it is estimated that 54% of CYP2D6 UMs and 3% of EMs have donepezil concentrations beneath the lower limit of 30 ng ml^−1^ while the risk for PMs is minimal to have concentrations below this threshold.

### Concentration/CYP2D6 phenotypes-adverse events relationship

Out of the 129 patients, 57% reported no AEs while 43% experienced at least one AE. Among them, 14% presented with gastrointestinal problems (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia), 16% dizziness, 11% headache, 8% insomnia, 20% fatigue, 6% muscle cramp, 13% accidents (falls) and 11% pain. No significant association was found between donepezil *C*_av_ and the presence of AEs. Even though not statistically significant, CYP2D6 PMs had a higher occurrence of AEs compared with the rest of the cohort (70% (*n* = 9) in PMs *vs*. 40% (*n* = 48) in other phenotypic groups ≥one AE, *P* = 0.13), which might be related to elevated concentrations in this sub-population.

## Discussion

There is a large interindividual variability in the clinical response to acetlycholinesterase inhibitors, with responder rates as low as 15–35% [[3](#b3),[34](#b34),[35](#b35)]. Because a concentration–response effect has been reported for donepezil, differences in therapeutic outcome could be related, to some extent, to genetic polymorphisms in genes implicated in the metabolism or transport of donepezil. Thus, optimization of the treatment through an individual dose-adaption, taking into account both clinical characteristics and the genetic background of a patient, might increase efficacy and tolerability. In this naturalistic cross-sectional study, 129 dementia patients receiving treatment with donepezil were included in a population pharmacokinetic study to assess interpatient variability and identify genetic and non-genetic sources of variability. To our knowledge, this is the first population pharmacokinetic approach to study extensively the pharmacogenetics of donepezil.

The pharmacokinetic estimates of the CL and steady-state plasma concentrations are in good accordance with published studies [[36](#b36),[37](#b37)]. In contrast, the estimated *V* is lower than the steady-state *V* reported previously [[38](#b38),[39](#b39)]. This discrepancy is mostly related to differences in study design, with collection over a 24 h interval in former studies preventing the estimation of the large distribution of the drug in peripheral tissues.

In agreement with donepezil (Aricept) label information, age, renal function and nicotine consumption had no significant influence on donepezil CL [[1](#b1)]. In contrast, a significant influence of gender on donepezil pharmacokinetics was observed, with an 18% reduced CL in female compared with male patients. Because bodyweight has been shown to effect donepezil CL, this finding might be explained by differences in bodyweight between female and male individuals, which was not measured in our study population [[1](#b1)].

Due to the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 dependent metabolism of donepezil, it is suggested that drug interactions with inhibitors of these enzymes could be important. Considering the whole study population, an influence of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers was observed. The influence of CYP3A4 co-medication did not remain significant once the two patients with very high and low CL receiving moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers were excluded, suggesting a confounding bias in the analyses. Because 30% and 50% of patients received co-medication with moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, a relevant influence of these co-medications can be excluded. In contrast, the small number of patients receiving strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers limited the statistical power to detect minor changes in CL. Supporting our results, rather small changes in donepezil pharmacokinetics have been observed in two previous interaction studies in healthy volunteers. The concurrent administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a significant increase in donepezil plasma concentrations, estimated to be 23–30% at steady-state [[6](#b6)]. Moreover, the co-administration of cimetidine, a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor, yielded 10% higher peak plasma concentrations and AUC values [[7](#b7)]. The clinical significance of CYP dependent drug interactions remains to be determined in further studies.

In the current study, we examined the influence of polymorphisms in genes implicated in donepezil metabolism on the donepezil pharmacokinetic profile. The *CYP2D6* genotype revealed to be a major determinant of donepezil CL, with CYP2D6 PMs and UMs having a 32% decreased and 67% increased CL compared with EMs, respectively. As expected, a lower CL was observed in hetEMs compared with homEMs although the difference was non-significant. Although CYP2D6 genotypes have been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of many drugs [[8](#b8),[40](#b40)], only one previous study, to our knowledge, investigating the relationship between CYP2D6 genotypes and donepezil pharmacokinetics, has been published [[4](#b4)]. This study reported a tendency toward lower plasma levels in homEMs compared with hetEMs, and UMs had lower plasma concentrations than EMs [[4](#b4)]. However, the differences in plasma concentrations did not reach statistical significance, possibly because only a small number of subjects (*n* = 42) and no PMs were included [[4](#b4)]. In addition, an influence of the *CYP2D6* genotype has been reported in the Aricept label information, describing a 31.5% decreased and a 24% increased donepezil CL in CYP2D6 PMs and UMs compared with EMs, respectively [[1](#b1)]. The findings in our study confirm the influence of the CYP2D6 PM and UM phenotype on donepezil CL, however, the effect of the UM phenotype is more pronounced in our population. This difference might be due to different study populations and number of patients, which is not described in the Aricept label information. Therefore, the current study broadens our knowledge in showing for the first time these significant relationships in a patient population recruited from a naturalistic setting.

In the current analyses, genetic variations in *CYP3A4/5/7* and *ABCB1* do not appear to play a significant role in donepezil pharmacokinetics, which is consistent with a previous study analyzing the effect of polymorphisms in *CYP3A4/5* and *ABCB1* on donepezil plasma concentrations [[14](#b14)]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the relationship between POR, PXR and donepezil pharmacokinetics. Interest in the electron transferring enzyme POR and the nuclear receptor PXR resulted from the search on polymorphisms in genes influencing CYP3A expression and activity. The most often studied *POR* polymorphism is the exonic SNP rs1057868C>T, defining the allele **28*, for which our group showed an influence on CYP3A activity in two independent cohorts [[17](#b17)]. Moreover, recent attention was drawn on three polymorphisms in the regulatory region of *NR1I2* (rs1523130, rs2472677, rs7643645), which were associated with PXR and CYP3A4 expression *in vitro.* In our study population, the investigated polymorphisms in POR and PXR did not influence donepezil CL to a significant amount. For confirmation, these analyses should be repeated in other cohorts.

To date no prospective studies have been conducted to establish a therapeutic range of donepezil for efficacy and tolerability optimization. However, in recently published consensus guidelines, a therapeutic range of 30–75 ng ml^−1^ was proposed [[30](#b30)]. The range was based on the plasma I*C*_50_ of donepezil for cerebral acetylcholinesterase inhibition estimated around 50 ng ml^−1^ [[37](#b37)] and on the observation that a plateau of acetylcholinesterase inhibition was reached at plasma concentrations between 50 and 75 ng ml^−1^, which corresponded to 77 and 84% enzyme inhibition in red blood cells [[41](#b41)]. The inhibition in red blood cells has been shown to correspond closely to the inhibitory effect in the cortex [[41](#b41)]. Moreover, significant associations between plasma concentrations of donepezil and efficacy of the treatment have been observed, indicating a possible benefit of therapeutic drug monitoring for this drug [[41](#b41)]. Simulations performed on our study population demonstrated that for CYP2D6 EM patients, the predicted *C*_av_ after 10 mg daily doses were in good agreement with the proposed therapeutic range. The proportion of patients exceeding the therapeutic range was considerably higher in CYP2D6 PMs, while the majority of CYP2D6 UM patients did not reach the proposed therapeutic range. Although not significant, the occurrence of AEs was increased in PMs compared with the rest of the cohort, advocating for further investigation for concentration–toxicity relationships. One limitation is that AEs were recorded when most participants had already been receiving donepezil for several months, rendering the differentiation between donepezil related AEs and effects of concomitant diseases or medication difficult. Moreover, transient AEs were no more present and intolerant patients would have already reduced the dose or discontinued the treatment. Thus, confirmation of the result in other study cohorts, with a longitudinal follow-up, is required. Another limitation of the cross-sectional study design, as well as the inclusion of patients with different stages of dementia, is that the impact of plasma concentrations on the efficacy of the drug could not be investigated. While considering these limitations, the results of this study suggest that the standard dose of 10 mg is suitable to reach the proposed therapeutic donepezil concentrations in CYP2D6 EM. A reduction of the standard dose might increase tolerability in CYP2D6 PM patients, whereas an increased dose of donepezil or an antidementia drug metabolized by another pathway than CYP2D6 might be beneficial in CYP2D6 UM patients. However, with respect to a possible benefit of individual donepezil dose adaption, further studies on the concentration–effect relationship are necessary to establish an evidence-based therapeutic range.

In summary, the pharmacokinetic parameters of donepezil were adequately described by our population model, showing a significant influence of gender on donepezil CL. Beside clinical factors, genetic polymorphisms in *CYP2D6*, *CYP3A*, *ABCB1*, *POR* and *PXR*, possibly influencing donepezil metabolism and transport, were investigated. Functional alleles of CYP2D6 were significantly related to donepezil pharmacokinetics. CYP2D6 PMs and UMs demonstrated, respectively, a slower and faster elimination compared with EMs. No other genetic covariates were associated with donepezil CL. These findings contribute to the better understanding of interindividual variability in donepezil pharmacokinetics and might be useful to improve clinical outcome and tolerability of the treatment.
