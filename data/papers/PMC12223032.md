## Abstract

This study examines the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and UGT1A4, and the transporter ABCB1 on tacrolimus dose requirements and blood trough level variability in the period immediately after liver transplantation. We analyzed genotypes for these genes in 61 adult liver transplant recipients who received tacrolimus and their respective donors. Significant findings include increased average daily deviation (ADD) from the therapeutic range in patients with: donor CYP3A4*22 GG (1.68 [1.01, 2.29] versus 0.68 [0.42, 1.46] ng/mL/day, p = 0.016), recipient ABCB1 rs2032582 CT/TT (2.07 [1.68, 2.39] versus 1.37 [0.76, 1.95] ng/mL/day , p = 0.013), and donor UGT1A4*3 TT (1.69 [1.02, 2.42] versus 1.33 [0.54, 1.79] ng/mL/day , p = 0.043). Additionally, higher tacrolimus concentration/weight-adjusted dose ratios [C0/D ratio, (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d)] were observed in recipients with CYP3A4*1B rs2740574 genotype TT (77.5 [60.7, 143.8] versus 47.5 [26.3, 64.0] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.0001), or CYP3A5*3 rs776746 genotype GG (74.9 [55.7, 147.4] versus 59.3 [36.1, 79.0] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.011), and in donor livers with CYP3A4*22 genotype GA/AA (131.5 [86.2, 187.1] versus 68.2 [47.1, 108.7] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.028). These findings demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms in both donor and recipient significantly affect tacrolimus dose requirements and the ability to maintain the target therapeutic tacrolimus levels in the immediate post-transplant period, emphasizing the role of precision medicine in optimizing immunosuppression therapeutic drug dosing.

## Introduction

After liver transplantation (LT), tacrolimus blood levels are closely monitored due to its narrow therapeutic window. Tacrolimus underexposure increases risk of graft rejection, while overexposure increases risk of infection and toxicity^1,2^. Intra-patient variability in tacrolimus levels during the early post-transplantation period poses a significant challenge for appropriate dosing^3–5^. High variability in the first 30 days after transplantation is associated with acute rejection, de novo donor-specific antibody formation, longer inpatient stays, worse graft and overall survival, and increased rates of cardiovascular, renal, and neurological complications^4–6^. Moreover, between the third and sixth months after LT, high variability correlates with poor survival rates and impaired renal function^7^. In the pediatric population, high variability is an independent risk factor for late rejection and graft loss^8^.

Given these associations, identifying predictive factors of intra-patient variability in tacrolimus levels and dosing is crucial. Currently, therapeutic drug monitoring is the standard-of-care for management of tacrolimus dosing. However, its effectiveness is limited, as evidenced by the substantial daily variability in tacrolimus concentrations within individual patients^1^. This underscores the need for more precise methods to optimize immunosuppressive dosing and improve outcomes for liver transplant recipient.

Tacrolimus is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane efflux pump encoded by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (*ABCB1*). ABCB1 is expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells, where it facilitates the removal of drugs and other small molecules from the cell, specifically on the apical membrane of enterocytes and the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (Fig. [1](#Fig1)A). Here, it is responsible for drug efflux into intestinal lumen or bile, preventing systemic drug absorption and promoting drug clearance via the gastrointestinal tract.

Activity of ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and UGT1A4 enzymes. (A) ABCB1, expressed on the apical membrane of enterocytes and the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, is responsible for drug efflux (including tacrolimus) into the intestinal lumen or the bile, hampering systemic drug absorption by promoting its clearance via the gastrointestinal tract. (B and C) CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are expressed in hepatocytes and enterocytes and are involved in drug metabolism. UGT1A4 is expressed in hepatocytes and enterocytes and is involved in drug glucuronidation (including tacrolimus-glucoronidate, i.e. Glucuro-TAC), which generates excretable drug metabolites.

Tacrolimus is also a substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3 A enzymes, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which are present in the liver and intestines. These enzymes oxidize small organic molecules, playing a critical role in drug metabolism (Fig. [1](#Fig1)B)^1,2^.

Additionally, tacrolimus is a substrate for uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A4, an enzyme involved in the glucuronidation pathway. This pathway transforms small lipophilic molecules into water-soluble, excretable metabolites. UGT1A4, which is expressed in the liver and intestines, is the major isoform responsible for tacrolimus glucuronidation to tacrolimus-glucoronidate (glucuro-TAC), facilitating it biliary excretion (Fig. [1](#Fig1)C)^9^. Therefore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in *ABCB1*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, and *UGT1A4* all affect tacrolimus transport, clearance, and metabolism rates.

Notably, presence of the *CYP3A5*3* variant, the most studied SNP of *CYP3A5*, has been found to correlate with decreased dose requirements when present in both the recipient and the donor liver^10–12^. While *CYP3A4*1B* and *CYP3A4*22*affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in renal transplant patients^13,14^, studies in liver recipients remain limited. Key SNPs of *ABCB1*, namely *rs2032582*, *rs1128503*, and *rs1045642*, have been associated with variations in trough levels and dose requirements within the first two weeks after transplantation^12^. The impact of *UGT1A4*polymorphisms on the variability of tacrolimus glucuronidation has not been thoroughly studied^9^.

Population pharmacokinetic models of tacrolimus have been developed to tailor the initial dose recommendations in adult liver recipients^15^, potentially enhancing clinical efficacy and reducing toxicity. One genotype-guided dosing model aims to predict the initial tacrolimus dose to achieve target blood trough levels within 24 h^16^. However, as this model was derived from a Chinese patient population, its generalizability to other populations with different allele frequencies remains uncertain, warranting further research on genetic polymorphisms’ effects on tacrolimus dosing and monitoring. Although studies have investigated the effects of polymorphisms on tacrolimus trough levels and dosing requirements, the impact of these polymorphisms on the ease and predictability of immediate post-transplant immunosuppression dosing in LT patients remains unexplored.

This study aims to examine how SNPs in *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *UGT1A4*, and *ABCB1* affect tacrolimus trough level variability [as measured by average daily deviations (ADD) from the target trough blood levels] and tacrolimus dosing requirements in the immediate postoperative period after LT (as measured by the dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough concentration C_0_/D). We hypothesize that these SNPs not only affect the weight-adjusted dose requirement but also the ease and predictability of dosing liver transplant recipients to maintain tacrolimus trough levels in therapeutic range. Validating this hypothesis would imply that both donor and recipient genotypes in these genes affect postoperative dosing requirements and anticipate differences in trough level variability and dosing needs.

## Methods

### Patients

Sixty-one consecutive adult patients who underwent orthotopic whole graft LT from deceased donors were included in this retrospective analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Florida (IRB201800053) and all procedures were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and according to the approved protocol. Informed consent was obtained from all recipients prior to enrollment. Demographic data including age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), preoperative diagnosis, and type of donor [donation after brain death (DBD) or donation after circulatory death (DCD)] were collected (Tables [1](#Tab1) and [2](#Tab2)).

### Medications

Following liver transplantation at the University of Florida, all study patients were started on a medication regimen per established center protocol. A three-drug combination of (i) oral tacrolimus (Prograf), (ii) corticosteroid (intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg iv intraoperatively followed by intravenous methylprednisolone 250 mg iv on post-operative days 1 and 2, 125 mg on post-operative day 3 and oral prednisone taper starting on post-operative day 4 if able to tolerate oral medications), and (iii) mycophenolate [usually oral mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) 500 mg q12h or oral mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) 360 mg q 12 h]. Induction is with intravenous methylprednisolone. The standard target trough range is 8–10 ng/mL for the first month after transplant. This 2 ng/mL range is adjusted based on the clinical condition of the patient per the clinical team and institutional standard-of-care. Reasons to adjust the trough range included risk/concern/evidence for infection, rejection, malignancy, or neurological or renal dysfunction.

Patients received their tacrolimus dose via oral or sublingual administration twice daily. The institutional protocol introduces tacrolimus within the first 48 h, starting with a sublingual dose of 0.05 mg/kg, based on actual body weight. Dose decisions followed standard-of-care, and physicians were unaware of patient genotypes at the time of decision-making. Clinicians based subsequent dosing and changes from sublingual to oral formulation on the patients’ response to the previous doses, their clinical status, and other clinical factors such as interacting medications at the time. Tacrolimus trough levels were measured daily in the morning until patient discharge, using an automated chemiluminescent assay (CMIA; Abbott Laboratories) on the ARCHITECT i2000 platform, per center standards.

### DNA isolation

Clinical standard-of-care biopsies at the time of transplant were obtained from both donor and recipient livers for each patient. Tissue samples were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and stored by the center’s clinical pathology service. Subsequently, tissue scrolls were cut from FFPE blocks. GeneRead DNA FFPE Kits were used to isolate DNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

### Genotyping SNPs for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1

The following SNPs from both donor and recipient were genotyped using a Taqman genotyping assay: *CYP3A4*1B rs2740574, CYP3A4*22 rs35599367, CYP3A5*3 rs776746, CYP3A5*6 rs10264272, CYP3A5*7 rs41303343, UGT1A4*2 rs6755571, UGT1A4*3 rs2011425, ABCB1 rs1045642, ABCB1 rs1128503,* and *ABCB1 rs2032582*^9,12–14,17^. Genotyping was performed at the Genotyping Core Lab at the University of Florida Center for Pharmacogenomics and Precision Medicine.

### Assessed phenotypes

Two main phenotypic outputs were analyzed. *Tacrolimus trough level variability* was measured by the average daily deviation (ADD) from the standard-of-care indicated therapeutic range (typically 8–10 ng/mL as noted above). Its daily assessment began on the third day after the first dose of tacrolimus and proceeded until recipient discharge. ADD = Sum (tacrolimus trough level deviation out of range)/number of dosed days. For example, if a patient had the following tacrolimus trough levels on consecutive days:

The deviations outside the target range (8-10 ng/mL) would be:

So, the ADD would be:

ADD = (1 + 0 + 1 + 0)/4 = 0.5 ng/mL/day.

As an adjunct, we also calculated the fraction of each patient’s post-transplant hospital stay (measured in days) during which the tacrolimus trough level was more than 2 ng/mL outside of the clinically indicated range. *Tacrolimus dosing requirement* was measured by calculating C_0_/D (tacrolimus concentration/weight-adjusted dose ratio) and weight-adjusted dose on the day of discharge from the index admission for liver transplantation.

### Genotype classification

The binary classification of genotypes is based on two main criteria: the number of individuals in each genotype group and the functional impact of each genotype on enzyme activity. Specifically, genotypes were grouped to ensure that comparisons reflect the functional consequences of genetic variants on enzyme activity. For instance, genotypes resulting in high enzyme activity were grouped separately from those resulting in low or null activity, thereby providing meaningful insights into the associations with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and variability. This approach ensures that each group is sufficiently large for statistical analysis and that the functional differences between the groups are biologically relevant.

### Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are reported as medians with interquartile ranges (Q1–Q3) due to non-normal distribution (as assessed by the Shapiro–Wilk test). Categorical variables are reported as frequencies and percentages. Wilcoxon tests were conducted between two different genotypes for each SNP to determine any significant differences in the four phenotypic outputs among the genotypes. Kruskal–Wallis tests were also performed among three different genotypes for each SNP to determine any significant differences in the phenotypic outputs. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To assess the independent effects of genetic and clinical covariates on tacrolimus trough variability and dosing requirements, we conducted multivariate linear regression analyses. Covariates included in the final model were those found significant in univariate analysis (p < 0.1), along with key clinical factors. Model diagnostics and assumptions were evaluated, and results are presented as adjusted beta coefficients with corresponding confidence intervals and p-values. All tests were performed using JMP Pro statistical software version 17.0.0 (Cary, NC, USA).

## Results

### Study population

A total of 61 liver transplant recipients, 26 female and 35 male, were enrolled. The median age was 58 years. The majority of recipients were non-Hispanic White. The major indications for LT were alcohol-related cirrhosis (36.0%) and metabolic disease associated steatohepatitis (27.9%) (Table [1](#Tab1)). The median post-transplant length of hospital stay was 12 days. The median age of the donors was 38 years with the majority being non-Hispanic White (Table [2](#Tab2)). 37 patients were on fluconazole at some point after transplant, with 21 of them still on fluconazole at time of discharge. There were no withdrawals or subjects lost to follow-up during the study.

### SNP genotyping and phenotypic analysis

We genotyped all 61 recipients and their respective donors for the following SNPs: *CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A5*6, CYP3A5*7, UGT1A4*2, UGT1A4*3, ABCB1 rs1045642, ABCB1 rs1128503,* and *ABCB1 rs2032582*. The SNP frequencies for both donors and recipients are summarized in Table [3](#Tab3), along with allele frequencies from the general population as a reference. (Pharmgkb.org) Genotyping attempts for some donors and recipients failed to yield reliable results despite multiple attempts, including reisolation of DNA and use of other techniques such as arrays. These are listed in Table [3](#Tab3) and were excluded from the individual genotyping analyses.

### Tacrolimus dosing requirement

Recipient *CYP3A4*1B* and *CYP3A5*3* SNPs and donor *CYP3A4*22* SNPs were correlated with C_0_/D (tacrolimus concentration/weight-adjusted dose ratio) (Table [4](#Tab4)). Similarly, recipient *CYP3A4*1B* and *UGT1A4*3* SNPs were correlated with the tacrolimus dose/weight ratio at discharge (Table S1). Recipients with TT genotype in *CYP3A4*1B* had a higher mean C_0_/D (77.5 [60.7, 143.8] versus 47.5 [26.3, 64.0] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.0001) and a corresponding lower dose/weight ratio at discharge (0.09 [0.05, 0.13] versus 0.16 [0.13, 0.20] mg/kg/d, p = 0.0019) than recipients with genotypes CT or CC. Recipients with GG genotypes in *CYP3A5*3* had a higher mean C_0_/D (74.9 [55.7, 147.4] versus 59.3 [36.1, 79.0] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.011) than recipients with AG or AA genotypes; they also trended towards a correspondingly lower dose/weight ratio (0.09 [0.05, 0.13] versus 0.14 [0.09, 0.18] mg/kg/d, p = 0.13). Recipients of donor livers with GG genotype in *CYP3A4*22* has a lower mean C_0_/D than recipients of donor livers with AG or AA genotypes (68.2 [47.1, 108.7] versus 131.5 [86.2, 187.1] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.028); this corresponded with a similar, statistically not significant trend in dose/weight ratio (0.10 [0.05, 0.13] versus 0.07 [0.04, 0.10] mg/kg/d, p = 0.13). Additionally, while recipients with TT genotype in *UGT1A4*3* had a significantly higher mean tacrolimus dose/weight ratio than those with GG or GT genotypes (0.10 [0.05, 0.14] versus 0.06 [0.04, 0.10] mg/kg/d, p = 0.037), the corresponding difference in C_0_/D did not reach statistical significance (72.2 [50.2, 128.5] versus 105.6 [59.3, 186.2] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.24).

### Effect of fluconazole on tacrolimus dosing requirement

Given the potential for significant effect on tacrolimus dosing, we examined the effect of being on fluconazole at discharge, on mycophenolic acid rather than mycophenolate mofetil, or on hemodialysis on C_0_/D. Only being on fluconazole at discharge had a statistically significant effect on C_0_/D, with patients on fluconazole having a higher level than those not on fluconazole (77.5 [63.0, 154.4] versus 63.2 [40.3, 91.5] (ng/mL)/(mg/kg/d), p = 0.0092). Therefore, we split the analysis into patients who were on fluconazole at discharge, when the C_0_/D was calculated and those who were not on fluconazole at that time. The effects of recipient *CYP3A4*1B* (p = 0.018) and donor *CYP3A4*22* (p = 0.036) SNPs remained significant in patients not on fluconazole (Table S2), but the effect of recipient *CYP3A5*3* (p = 0.080) was no longer statistically significant. In patients on fluconazole at discharge (Table S3), only the effect of recipient *CYP3A4*1B* (p = 0.0098) remained significant; the effects of donor *CYP3A4*22* (p = 0.43) and recipient *CYP3A5*3* (p = 0.068) were not statistically significant. In the cohort of patients on fluconazole at discharge, donor *CYP3A5*3* SNPs did have a significant effect on C_0_/D (p = 0.037), but this effect was not significant in either the whole cohort (p = 0.057) or in the subset not on fluconazole at discharge (p = 0.20).

### Trough level variability

Donor *CYP3A4*22* and *UGT1A4*3* and recipient *ABCB1 rs2032582* SNPs were correlated with the average daily deviation (ADD) from target trough range (ng/mL per day) (Table [5](#Tab5)). Patients transplanted with donor livers with *CYP3A4*22* SNP GG had higher ADD than those with SNPs AG or AA (1.68 [1.01, 2.29] versus 0.68 [0.42, 1.46] ng/mL/day, p = 0.016). Patients transplanted with donor livers with *CYP3A5*7* SNP AA insertion tended towards higher ADD than those without the insertion (1.59 [0.89, 2.21] versus 0.60 [0.40, 0.79] ng/mL/day, p = 0.054). Patients transplanted with donor livers with *UGT1A4*3* SNP TT had higher ADD than those with SNPs GT or GG (1.69 [1.02, 2.42] versus 1.33 [0.54, 1.79] ng/mL/day, p = 0.043). Recipients with *ABCB1 rs2032582*SNP CC had lower ADD than those with SNPs TC or TT (1.37 [0.76, 1.95] versus 2.07 [1.68, 2.39] ng/mL/day, p = 0.013). Using another measure of tacrolimus trough level variability, the fraction of hospital stay in which recipients had tacrolimus trough levels greater than 2 ng/mL out-of-range^18^, yielded similar correlations with donor *CYP3A4*22*, *CYP3A5*7*, and *UGT1A4*3* and recipient *ABCB1 rs2032582* SNPs, though the difference in donor *CYP3A4*22* did not reach statistical significance (Table S4). Given again the potential for significant effect on tacrolimus dosing, we examined the effect of being on fluconazole at any point during the hospitalization, on mycophenolic acid rather than mycophenolate mofetil, or on hemodialysis on ADD. None of these factors had a statistically significant effect on ADD.

### Combinations of SNPs

As there were subjects with multiple SNPs correlated with the measured phenotypes, we decided to evaluate whether having combinations of SNPs were also correlated with these phenotypes. For the tacrolimus dosing requirement, genotypes that were individually correlated with lower C_0_/D (i.e., higher metabolism) were given a score of 1, whereas genotypes that were individually correlated with higher C_0_/D were given a score of 0. Similarly, for the trough level variability, genotypes that were individually correlated with higher ADD (i.e., higher variability) were given a score of 1, whereas genotypes that were individually correlated with lower ADD were given a score of 0. The total SNP score for each patient was calculated by adding the individual scores from the individual genes.

For C_0_/D, three genes (recipient *CYP3A4*1B*, recipient *CYP3A5*3*, and donor *CYP3A4*22*) were analyzed in combination to determine how these SNPs together could have an overall impact on this phenotype. The overall trend was a decrease in C_0_/D with each additional SNP (Fig. [2](#Fig2)A). Patients with a SNP score of 0 or a score of 1 had a significantly higher C_0_/D than patients with a SNP score of 3 (p = 0.0040 and p = 0.016, respectively). Patients with a SNP score of 0 also had a significantly higher C_0_/D than patients with a SNP score of 2 (p = 0.016). This trend held true even when limiting this analysis to just the recipient SNPs; patients with a recipient SNP score of 0 had a significantly higher C_0_/D than patients with a recipient SNP score of 2 (p = 0.0062) (Fig. [2](#Fig2)B).

SNP combination score correlates with tacrolimus C0/D. (A) Correlation of combination score using SNPs in three genes (recipient CYP3A4*1B, recipient CYP3A5*3, and donor CYP3A4*22). (B) Correlation of combination score using SNPs in two recipient genes (CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3).

Next, for tacrolimus trough variability, four genes (donor *CYP3A4*22*, donor *CYP3A5*7*, donor *UGT1A4*3*, and recipient *ABCB1 rs2032582*) were analyzed in combination to determine how these SNPs together could have an overall impact on this phenotype. The overall trend was an increase in ADD with each additional SNP (Fig. [3](#Fig3)). Patients with a SNP score of 1 had a significantly lower ADD than patients with a SNP score of 2 or 3 (p = 0.011 and p = 0.019, respectively).

SNP combination score correlates with Average Daily Deviation (ADD) from target trough level. Correlation of combination score using SNPs in four genes (donor CYP3A4*22, donor CYP3A5*7, donor UGT1A4*3, and recipient ABCB1 rs2032582). (No subjects had scores of 0 or 4.).

We also conducted a multivariable linear regression analysis to assess the association between statistically significant SNP variants and C_0_/D. The model included recipient *CYP3A5*3* and *CYP3A4*1B*, donor *CYP3A4*22*, and fluconazole use at discharge. None of the variables demonstrated a statistically significant association with C_0_/D ratio in the multivariable model (all p > 0.25), and the overall model explained only a modest proportion of the variability in tacrolimus exposure (R^2^ = 0.085). Although the analysis showed trends in the expected directions, these associations did not reach statistical significance. Expanding the model to include additional SNPs or clinical factors such as age, sex, BMI, other medications, dialysis, and race/ethnicity did not improve the model performance.

Similarly, we conducted multivariable linear regression analysis to identify genetic predictors of ADD. The model included donor genotypes for *CYP3A4*22* and *UGT1A4*3*, and recipient genotype for *ABCB1 rs2032582*. The model was statistically significant (p = 0.0092) and explained approximately 24% of the variance in ADD (R^2^ = 0.238). Donor *CYP3A4*22* GG genotype (β = − 0.48, 95% CI − 0.85 to − 0.11, p = 0.011) and donor *UGT1A4*3* GG/TG genotype (β = − 0.34, 95% CI − 0.66 to − 0.03, p = 0.033) were both independently associated with significantly lower ADD, while recipient *ABCB1 rs2032582* genotype did not reach statistical significance (β = − 0.17, 95% CI − 0.54 to 0.19, p = 0.35). Expanding the model to include additional SNPs or clinical factors such as age, sex, BMI, other medications, dialysis, and race/ethnicity did not improve the model performance.

## Discussion

The results above indicate that dosing tacrolimus and maintaining tacrolimus trough levels within therapeutic range in the immediate post-transplant period are influenced by genetic polymorphisms in both donor and recipient in drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A4) and drug transporters (ABCB1). Genetic variation in these genes results in different rates of drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion, consequently affecting drug dosing and levels. These polymorphisms not only determine the immunosuppression dose, but they also impact the ease and predictability of post-transplant daily dosing while the patient and organs are recovering from the transplant operation.

SNPs in *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *UGT1A4*, and *ABCB1* impact drug metabolism and transport rates. This exacerbates intra-patient variability and therapeutic drug monitoring during the post-transplant period. Our study demonstrates significant contributions of SNP variants in these genes to tacrolimus trough level variability after LT. For example, patients with the donor liver AG genotype in *CYP3A4*22* are intermediate metabolizers (IM) and exhibit a lower ADD. Extensive metabolizers (EM) with the donor liver GG genotype have more out-of-range trough levels, possibly due to a bigger change in enzyme function from immediately after transplantation to later days as the transplanted liver graft recovers metabolic function. Conversely, recipient genetic variation in *ABCB1 rs203582*, significantly contributes to early post-transplant variability in tacrolimus blood troughs. Patients with heterozygous TC or homozygous minor allele TT have decreased transporter expression and thus activity, leading to decreased drug clearance into the intestinal lumen or bile, possibly resulting in their having a higher ADD compared to those with CC genotype and greater transporter activity.

Genetic variations in these key drug metabolism and drug transport genes can also affect the required tacrolimus dose to maintain therapeutic drug levels. In the early postoperative period, higher doses of tacrolimus are required to maintain drug therapeutic levels in recipients that have either CC or CT genotype for the *CYP3A4*1B* SNP and for recipients with AA or AG genotype for *CYP3A5*3* SNP. Individuals with these genotypes are recognized as extensive tacrolimus metabolizers. In contrast, poor tacrolimus metabolizing recipients with either TT genotypes in *CYP3A4*1B* and GG genotypes in *CYP3A5*3* require significantly lower drug doses to maintain therapeutic levels. Studies on *CYP3A4*1B* in LT patients are scarce, and studies in patients after renal transplantation are conflicting. In renal transplantation, *CYP3A4*1B* polymorphisms were associated with lower tacrolimus trough levels and higher dose requirements in some studies^13,19^and no associations in others^17^. Our study is consistent with studies showing that polymorphisms in liver recipient *CYP3A4*1B* can indeed impact early tacrolimus dose requirements, with higher dose requirements in recipients who had at least one copy of the C allele. It should be noted that strong linkage disequilibrium between *CYP3A4*1B* and *CYP3A5*1* can hinder the determination of the isolated impact of *CYP3A4*1B*^13^..

Homozygosity (GG) for *CYP3A5*3*, which results in a truncated, nonfunctional protein, is correlated with lower tacrolimus dose requirements and higher trough levels^10–12^. While some studies have found donor *CYP3A5*3*GG genotype drives lower tacrolimus doses requirements, our results can only suggest this correlation, as the difference in our cohort did not reach statistical significance^16^. However, we did find that recipient *CYP3A5*3* genotype is relevant in determining the dose. Recipients with the mutant G allele in *CYP3A5*3* had lower tacrolimus dosing requirements. All together, these data highlight the importance of intestinal CYP3A5 activity and its impact on drug metabolism and dosing. It also underlines the key role that recipient extrahepatic organs, such as intestines, have in tacrolimus metabolism and transport, especially while the graft is regaining full function in the immediate post-transplant period.

SNP variants in *ABCB1* affect activity of the transmembrane efflux pump. While some studies on LT patients did not find an association between *ABCB1*polymorphisms and tacrolimus dose requirements^11,20^, others did, especially in the first two weeks post-transplant^12^. These findings emphasize the impact of recipient ABCB1 genotype, suggesting that variations in intestinal ABCB1 activity likely influence interindividual tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and dosing patterns. Our results are consistent with these findings, demonstrating that rs203582 allele variants associated with decreased ABCB1 tacrolimus efflux activity result in higher variability.

Glucuronidation is crucial for the elimination of drugs like tacrolimus through bile and urine. The *UGT1A4* isoform of *UGT*is predominant in the conjugation of glucuronide to tacrolimus, forming glucuro-TAC^8^. The introduction of the G variant allele in *UGT1A4*substitutes leucine with valine at amino acid position 48 (L48V), altering UGT1A4 activity^21^. The impact of this variant allele on tacrolimus glucuronidation and the involvement of the glucuro-TAC metabolite in tacrolimus’s immunosuppressive effect remain poorly understood^9,22^. In our study, recipients with the TT genotype had significantly higher dosing requirements as measured by dose/weight ratio during their hospital stay; this trend was similar but not statistically significant when examining the C_0_/D phenotype, however. This suggests that the presence of the G variant allele may decrease UGT1A4-mediated glucuronidation of tacrolimus post-transplant, leading to the requirement for lower drug doses to achieve therapeutic levels. We can further speculate that the increased activity of the donor livers with the TT phenotype had wider fluctuations in the post-transplant period thus increasing the dosing variability during that time.

The data presented here highlight the potential advantage of genotyping LT donors and recipients. Gene expression and enzymatic activity of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A4, and ABCB1 in both donor and recipient influence tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. This could be used in future precision medicine-based models to guide and predict tacrolimus dosing requirements in LT recipients, improving patient outcomes by decreasing the incidence of rejection, infection, and drug toxicity due to more tightly controlled drug levels.

### Limitations

Limitations of this study include the sample size, which in some instances led to low counts of minor alleles and possibly impacting the ability to accurately predict correlations between SNPs and tacrolimus trough levels and dosing, as well as drug-drug interactions. The ethnic and racial composition of the study population also limits the applicability of the results to other populations. Other possible confounding factors were not taken into consideration, such as other genetic polymorphisms, drug-drug interactions, or patient-specific factors, such as comorbidities. The study was not designed or powered to differentiate the effects of SNPs on sublingual versus oral dosing. Since all recipients switched to oral tacrolimus at most five days post-transplant and were discharged on the oral formulation, the difference in administration route is unlikely to impact the results. However, this potential confounding factor should be considered when interpreting the findings. Measurement limitations include some samples where SNP genotyping was unsuccessful despite multiple attempts. Finally, this study was focused on the short-term dosing of tacrolimus immediately after transplantation. It was not intended to capture the long-term effects of genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus dosing and outcomes.

## Conclusion

This study emphasizes the influence of genetic polymorphisms in both donor and recipient drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A4) and drug transporters (ABCB1) on tacrolimus dosing and trough level maintenance in the immediate postoperative period after LT. While these results contribute to the evidence for the role of pharmacogenomics in tacrolimus dosing, further research is needed to overcome the limitations of this study, validate findings in larger and more diverse populations, and investigate the long-term clinical implications of genetic polymorphisms on patient outcomes. Results from this study can contribute to the development of future precision medicine-guided model that would be capable of improving predictions in tacrolimus dosing and trough level variability, thus optimizing post-transplant outcomes.
