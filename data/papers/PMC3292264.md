## Abstract

**Aim:** 
Genetic polymorphisms have the potential to influence drug metabolism and vary among ethnic groups. This study evaluated the correlation of genetic polymorphisms with nevirapine pharmacokinetics exposure in Malawians.

**Materials & methods:** 
CYP450 2B6, 2D6, 3A4 and 3A5, ABCB1 and constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor, were analyzed for polymorphisms in 26 subjects.

**Results:** 
Allele frequencies (variant) were: CYP2B6 514G>T (0.31) CYP2D6*4 (0.02); CYP2D6*17 (0.35); CYP3A4*1B (0.77); CYP3A5*3 (0.25); ABCB1 2677G>T (0.0), ABCB1 3435C>T (0.21), NR1I3 13711152T>C (0.02), NR1I2 44477T>C (0.10), NR1I2 63396C>T (0.33), NR1I2 6-bp indel (del: 0.17). CYP2B6 516G>T (non-wild-type/wild-type) correlated with nevirapine pharmacokinetic parameters; geometric mean ratios (95% CI): 1.75 (1.27–2.40) for area under the concentration time curve (AUC)0–12 h, 1.58 (1.03–2.42) for C0, and 0.53 (0.31–0.91) for clearance. In a multivariable model, nevirapine AUC increased by 1.5% per year of age (p < 0.0001), CYP2B6 516 T allele increased AUC by 92% (p < 0.0001), and CYP3A5*3 decreased AUC by 31% (p = 0.0027).

**Conclusion:** 
Allele frequencies were similar to other sub-Saharan African populations. The T allele for CYP2B6 516 was significantly associated with nevirapine exposure.

### Materials & methods

*CYP450 2B6, 2D6, 3A4* and *3A5, ABCB1* and constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor, were analyzed for polymorphisms in 26 subjects.

### Results

Allele frequencies (variant) were: *CYP2B6* 514G*>*T (0.31) *CYP2D6*4* (0.02); *CYP2D6*17* (0.35); *CYP3A4*1B* (0.77); *CYP3A5*3* (0.25); *ABCB1* 2677G>T (0.0), *ABCB1* 3435C>T (0.21), *NR1I3* 13711152T>C (0.02), *NR1I2* 44477T>C (0.10), *NR1I2* 63396C>T (0.33), *NR1I2* 6-bp indel (del: 0.17). *CYP2B6* 516G>T (non-wild-type/wild-type) correlated with nevirapine pharmacokinetic parameters; geometric mean ratios (95% CI): 1.75 (1.27–2.40) for area under the concentration time curve (AUC)_0–12 h_, 1.58 (1.03–2.42) for C_0_, and 0.53 (0.31–0.91) for clearance.

## Materials & methods

### Study design

This was a nonrandomized pharmacogenetic observational study in HIV-infected Malawian children and adults who participated in pharmacokinetic studies evaluating nevirapine [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. The University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board and the Malawi National Health Sciences Research Committee approved the study protocol. All research subjects provided consent or assent with guardian consent. The objective was to determine the frequencies of *CYP, ABCB1* and nuclear receptor polymorphisms in 30 Malawian adults and children and to explore correlations between their genotypes and nevirapine (Virammune^®^) exposure.

### Samples & DNA extraction

Nevirapine concentrations were measured in blood plasma by a validated HPLC-UV method as previously described [[8](#R8),[9](#R9),[23](#R23)].

DNA was isolated from whole blood using the QIAamp^®^ DNA Mini kit (Qiagen Sciences, MD, USA). Genotyping was performed using PCR and Pyrosequencing^®^ as previously described [[24](#R24)]. Primers and PCR conditions for *ABCB1* 2677 (rs2032582) and 3435 (rs1045642), *CYP2B6* 516G>T (Q172H; rs3745274), *CYP2D6*4* (rs3892097), *CYP3A4*1B* (rs2740574), and *CYP3A5*3* (rs776746) were previously described [[24](#R24)–[27](#R27)]. For *CYP2D6*17* (rs28371706), DNA was amplified using the forward primer: 5′-GAG GCG CTG GTG ACC CAC-3′ and biotinylated reverse primers: 5′-biotin-CTG TCC CCA CCG CTG CTT-3′ at an annealing temperature of 65°C. The internal primer was 5′-CGC CTG TGC CCA TCA-3′ and the sequence to analyze was C/TCCAGATCC.

*NR1I2* 44477T>C (rs1523130), 63396C>T (rs2472677) and the 6-bp deletion (6-bp indel; rs3842689) were genotyped by previously described methods [[20](#R20)]. The *trans NR1I3* polymorphism, rs10494390 ([NT_004487.18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NT_004487.18):g.13711152T>C), was amplified from 50 ng of genomic DNA by the forward 5′-ACCTTCGGGGTTGAATTTT-3′ and reverse 5′-TGTAGCATTTGGGTTTTGGA-3′ primers.

### Data analysis/statistics

Genotype data from the Malawi sample was compared to genotype data of Yoruban (sub-Saharan African), African–American and Caucasians of European descent obtained from the HapMap database. Fisher’s Exact Test was used to determine whether the Malawian sample’s genotype frequencies differed significantly from the archived data. The Cochran–Armitage Trend Test was employed to determine if a genotype trend could be detected between groups.

The pharmacokinetic parameters were generated by noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin (v5.2, Pharsight, Inc., NC, USA). Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) _0–12 h_ was extrapolated from partial dosing interval data (adults: 0–8 h, children: 0–6 h). Weight-adjusted (kg) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was determined to confirm AUC results of the pediatric subjects. Trough concentrations (C_0_) are predose concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS (v9.1.3, SAS Institute, NC, USA). Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of non-wild-type (WT) versus WT genotypes were calculated using linear regression of natural log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters with α significance levels of 5% and 0.625%; the latter to account for multiple statistical tests for the eight genotypes tested. Multiple linear regression was performed to develop a multiple variable model (α = 0.05) with AUC as outcome and genotypes and demographics as covariates. WT genotypes are defined as genotypes that are homozygous for the WT allele, and non-WT genotypes are defined as genotypes that are either heterozygous or homozygous for the variant (VAR) allele. WT alleles are defined by having functional enzyme gene products, often designated as **1* for the *CYP*s, or having the highest allele frequency in this study sample.

## Results

DNA was isolated from 24 Malawian subjects, of whom 11 were adults with a median (range) age of 40 (26–46) years, weight of 72 (60–80) kg, BMI of 25.4 (19.8–32.5) kg/m^2^ and five were male. Thirteen were children with median (range) age of 6.7 (1.3–13.6) years, weight of 18 (9–30.5) kg, BMI z-score of 0.31 (−5.39–1.28) and six were male [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. Subjects were also taking trade formulations of lamivudine (Epivir^®^) and stavudine (Zerit^®^) at the time of pharmacokinetic sampling. Nevirapine was dosed using standard dosing in adults at 200 mg twice daily. The pediatric group was dosed using standard weight-based dosing, in which children up to 8 years of age are dosed 7 mg/kg twice daily and children 8 years of age and older are dose 4 mg/kg twice daily.

Genotype frequencies of 26 Malawians are presented in [Table 1](#T1); genetic sampling included two subjects without pharmacokinetic data. The genotypes could not be reliably tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium due to a small sample size. The Malawian genotype frequencies did not differ from Yorubans. The Malawian’s *CYP2D6*17* and *ABCB1* 2677G>T genotype data differed from that of the African–American individuals; other genotypes tested did not differ. The Malawian genotype frequencies differed from Caucasians in regards to all genotypes tested except for *CYP2B6* 516G>T (p = 0.31). The VAR allele frequencies of *CYP3A4*1B* and *CYP2D6*17* were higher and *CYP3A5*3*, *CYP2D6*4*, *ABCB1* 2677G>T, *ABCB1* 3435C>T, *NR1I3* 13711152T>C, *NR1I2* 44477T>C, 63396C>T and 6-bp indel were lower in the Malawians than Caucasians.

The results of the correlation analysis are listed in [Table 2](#T2). The pharmacokinetic data were log normally distributed. With α = 0.05, the *CYP2B6* 516 T allele was significantly associated with increased AUC, C_0_ and CL/F. With α = 0.00625 for multiple comparison correction, this significance was lost . The *NR1I2* 6-bp indel deletion allele was significantly associated with decreased AUC_0–12 h_ and increased CL/F with α = 0.05; however, this lost significance with α = 0.00625.

[Figure 1](#F1) shows a decrease in weight-based CL/F with the number of *CYP2D6*17* alleles within the pediatric group. This was not seen in the adult subjects ([Figure 1b](#F1)). In order to confirm the effect of *CYP2D6*17* on CL/F in the pediatric group, the GMR for CL/F was determined separately in the pediatric and adult groups. The GMR (VAR/WT; 95% CI) for *CYP2D6*17* was 0.59 (0.36–0.98; p = 0.04) and 1.02 (0.61–1.70; p = 0.9) for children and adults, respectively, demonstrating that *CYP2D6*17* is associated with decreased clearance only in the pediatric group of our sample.

The following multiple variable model was determined for nevirapine AUC: Ln(AUC_0–12 h_) = 10.67 + 0.65 (2B6Var) – 0.37 (3A5Var) + 0.015 (age). The *CYP2B6* 516 T allele increases AUC_0–12 h_ by 92% (95% CI: 51–145%), *CYP3A5*3* allele decreases AUC_0–12 h_ by 31% (95% CI: 12–46%) and age increases AUC_0–12 h_ by 1.5% (95% CI: 0.7–2%) per year. [Table 3](#T3) shows the p-values for each of the variables tested. The effect of the *PXR* 6-bp indel on nevirapine AUC was not significant in the final multiple variable model despite significance (α = 0.05) seen in the univariate analysis. A similar model was determined for weight-adjusted CL/F (not shown).

## Discussion

*CYP2B6* genotype is associated with intra-population differences in Malawians. Consistent with previous studies [[7](#R7)], the T allele at *CYP2B6* 516 correlated with increased exposure and decreased clearance of nevirapine. Since our study and others have demonstrated association of the T allele with increased nevirapine exposures and varying frequencies of *CYP* polymorphisms among ethnic groups, antiretrovirals must be evaluated in all potential treatment populations [[2](#R2),[7](#R7)].

Drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter genotype data from our sample agree with other African populations as reported in the HapMap database (Luhya in Webuye, Kenya; Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya and the Yoruban in Ibadan, Nigeria) [[22](#R22)]. For example, *CYP2B6* 516 T allele frequencies ranged from 0.315 to 0.42 for the African groups in the HapMap database; the Malawian frequency was 0.31. For *CYP3A5*3*, the HapMap database reports a wide range of allele frequencies: 0.128–0.486 (Malawians frequency: 0.25), which demonstrates sub-Saharan African ethnic groups could have dissimilar *CYP* allele frequencies. This may be clinically relevant to drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes.

Following the multiple comparisons correction, *CYP2B6* 516 T allele correlated with increased AUC. *CYP2B6* and age were independently associated with nevirapine AUC, C_0_ and CL/F. *CYP3A5*3* is an allele that causes decreased function of *CYP3A5* and is expected to decrease clearance of nevirapine, thereby increasing its exposure. Although there was no correlation in the univariate analysis, *CYP3A5*3* was associated with decreased AUC when controlling for *CYP2B6* and age. *CYP3A5*3* correlating with lower nevirapine exposure may be a result of heterozygous individuals in our sample expressing more enzyme than homozygous WT individuals and/or *CYP3A5*3* being in linkage with another functional allele [[28](#R28)]. In addition, our sample did not include individuals who were *CYP3A5*3*/**3*, which is a genotype found only in Africans based on the HapMap data, which may introduce bias in our model.

The *CYP2D6*17* allele appears to be specific to African populations and is associated with decreased CYP2D6 enzyme activity [[3](#R3)]. Only within the pediatric group did *CYP2D6*17* correlate with a decrease in weight-adjusted nevirapine CL/F, suggesting that CYP2D6 may play a larger role in nevirapine metabolism in children. However, this would need to be confirmed in a larger study population accounting for other *CYP2D6* SNPs and other polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium.

CAR and PXR are functionally linked with the expression of various CYPs [[19](#R19)]. Nevirapine preferentially induces CYP2B6 through activation of CAR [[19](#R19)], and polymorphisms in *PXR* are associated with higher basal expression and reduced induction of CYP3A4 activity [[20](#R20)]. Polymorphisms in *NR1I3* and *NR1I2* may attenuate the induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A5 leading to higher nevirapine exposures; however, our study did not demonstrate this. The *NR1I2* 6-bp indel, which is in linkage disequilibrium with *NR1I2* 44477T>C, was associated with lower nevirapine exposures, which may indicate increased basal expression of CYP3A4.

The multivariable model showed that nevi-rapine concentrations were influenced by *CYP2B6* and *CYP3A5* genotypes in addition to age. Currently there is limited clinical utility for this model, due to a lack of widely available genotypic testing for these enzymes in all populations. In addition, there is limited data linking genotype, concentration and safety and/or efficacy. Despite this, the clinical implications of this model include that it is possible to predict nevirapine exposures based on genotype. With more advanced modeling methods, nevi-rapine concentrations could be predicted based on genotype and other known patient factors in order to predict adverse effects such as rash due to supratherapeutic concentrations or virologic failure due to subtherapeutic concentrations. However, these models will also be limited to the groups in which they are studied. In addition, this is a potentially useful tool for research purposes in which outliers of drug concentrations exist with no obvious decreased adherence or extra dosing.

The US Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS) currently recommends a target nevirapine trough plasma concentration of 3 μg/ml based on data demonstrating a five-fold increase in virologic failure risk with lower trough concentrations [[29](#R29),[30](#R30),[101](#R32)]. These data were developed in a Caucasian population with the same doses currently being used in African populations. The Malawian and other sub-Saharan African HIV-infected patients would benefit greatly from efficacy and safety studies focusing on their populations since there is an overwhelming amount of data demonstrating that these groups have genetic differences that affect how the drugs are metabolized and eliminated.

Factors such as nutritional status and diet can also affect drug metabolism. Low protein and high carbohydrate consumption are associated with decreased hepatic CYP metabolism, while high protein diets are associated with increased metabolism [[31](#R31)]. Our subjects had normal nutritional status based on BMI, except for one underweight child. Western diets are generally higher in animal protein than those in sub-Saharan Africa, while diets in Malawi are considerably lower in animal protein and include carbohydrate-rich protein sources [[102](#R33)]. This dietary factor may contribute to the differences observed in nevirapine exposure between Malawians and westerners.

Despite our limited sample size, our novel pilot data provide evidence that ethnic diversity of drug-metabolizing enzyme genetics may play a role in antiretroviral drug exposures. Larger studies are needed to define population allele frequencies and to evaluate the clinical impact of drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporter and nuclear receptor polymorphisms.
