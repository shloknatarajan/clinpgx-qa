## Abstract

**Aim:** 
Episodes of acute pain crisis contribute to considerable morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). Incomprehensive understanding of the underlying pain heterogeneity results in inadequate pain management. The transient receptor potential (TRP) family of voltage-gated ion channels acts as sensory transducers of diverse noxious stimuli. We performed an association study of polymorphisms in candidate genes TRPV1 and TRPA1 with pain in SCD patients.

**Methods:** 
Utilization rate, in other words, number of emergency department/acute care center admissions over 12 months as a result of pain crisis, served as a marker for acute pain.

**Results & conclusion:** 
We identified that rs920829 (incident rate ratio = 1.44, p = 0.027 additive; IRR=1.68, p=0.008 recessive models of negative binomial regression) and the CGAGG haplotype of TRPA1 (odds ratio = 0.218, p = 0.009) were significantly associated with utilization rate, suggesting that TRPA1 gene polymorphisms may influence acute pain crisis in SCD.

### Aim:

Episodes of acute pain crisis contribute to considerable morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). Incomprehensive understanding of the underlying pain heterogeneity results in inadequate pain management. The transient receptor potential (TRP) family of voltage-gated ion channels acts as sensory transducers of diverse noxious stimuli. We performed an association study of polymorphisms in candidate genes *TRPV1* and *TRPA1* with pain in SCD patients.

### Methods:

Utilization rate, in other words, number of emergency department/acute care center admissions over 12 months as a result of pain crisis, served as a marker for acute pain.

### Results & conclusion:

We identified that rs920829 (incident rate ratio = 1.44, p = 0.027 additive; IRR=1.68, p=0.008 recessive models of negative binomial regression) and the CGAGG haplotype of *TRPA1* (odds ratio = 0.218, p = 0.009) were significantly associated with utilization rate, suggesting that *TRPA1* gene polymorphisms may influence acute pain crisis in SCD.

## Methods

### Subjects

The study was approved by the University of Illinois (IL, USA) at Chicago Institutional Review Board. Study participants gave written informed consent and blood and/or buccal swab samples were collected at the University of Illinois (UI) Hospital and Health Sciences System for DNA extraction. Patient eligibility criteria are described in detail in another article [[21](#B21)]. Analysis was conducted on subjects with SCD where both clinical data and genetic samples were available. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, a power analysis was not performed.

### Acute pain assessment

In our study, the number of admissions to the emergency department and/or acute care center as a result of pain crisis was counted as utilization and serves as the surrogate marker for acute pain. Utilizations resulted from sickle cell pain crises for the subsequent 12 months after the patient completed the baseline pain assessment were collected by medical record review for UI utilization or biweekly telephones calls for non-UI utilization. Utilization groups were categorized by 0 events (zero), 1–3 events (low) or 4–38 events (high) based on a previous study of SCD adults where CPI score predicted the subsequent 1-year acute care utilization by these three groups [[21](#B21)].

### Chronic pain assessment

Subjects self-administered the pain assessment tool, PAIN *Report* It^®^, an electronic touch screen format of the 1970 version of McGill Pain Questionnaire [[22](#B22)] that records pain location, intensity, quality and pattern [[3](#B3),[21](#B21),[23](#B23)]. A single CPI value with a range of 0–100 is calculated to represent the multidimensional pain experience [[21](#B21)]. The number of pain sites; average of current, least and worst pain intensity in the past 24 h; pain rating index total; and a pain pattern score that ranges from 0 to 6 were each converted to a 0–100 scale, then subsequently averaged [[22](#B22),[24](#B24),[25](#B25)]. This tool and its measure have previously been tested for patients with SCD [[21](#B21)].

### DNA extraction & genotyping

DNA extraction from blood samples was done by the QuickGene-mini80 isolation device with the QuickGene DNA whole blood extraction method (AutoGen, MA, USA) and a modified salting out procedure [[26](#B26)]. A modified phenol/chloroform procedure [[27](#B27)] was used to extract DNA from buccal samples. The MassARRAY iPLEX Platform (Sequenom, CA, USA) [[28](#B28)] was used to genotype all SNPs except for rs224534 and rs222747. PCR-RFLP was performed for these two SNPs according to previously published methods [[29](#B29)]. The genotyping success rate was more than 90%.

### Statistical analysis

A χ^2^ goodness-of-fit test was used to calculate Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. SNP influence on utilization was analyzed by an additive, dominant and recessive negative binomial regression model [[30](#B30),[31](#B31)] adjusted for age, sex and sickle cell type. SNP effects on three different utilization groups were analyzed by an additive, dominant and recessive ordinal logistic regression model adjusted for the same covariates [[21](#B21)]. The effect of SNPs on CPI value was analyzed by an additive, dominant and recessive multiple linear regression model [[32](#B32),[33](#B33)] adjusted for age, sex and sickle cell type. Major alleles are reference in all analyses. The dominant model for the following SNPs was not applicable due to low minor allele frequency: rs8065080 and rs13255063. *TRPV1* rs224534-dominant model in the analysis of utilization groups was also eliminated from analysis due to low minor allele frequency. Analysis was performed on Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 20; IBM, NY, USA) and R (version 3.4.0) [[34](#B34),[35](#B35)]. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was plotted and performed in Haploview version 4.2 (Broad Institute, MA, USA) [[36](#B36)]. Haplotype association analyses were performed with PLINK (Massachusetts General Hospital, the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, MA, USA) [[37](#B37),[38](#B38)]. Hap-logistic options were used on PLINK to include covariates (age, sex, ethnicity and sickle cell type) for utilization group analyses. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, multiplicity controls were not applied.

## Results

Demographics for 132 self-reported African–American subjects are provided in [Table 1](#T1). This study captured subjects with an age range of 15–70 years with a mean of 34.2 years. More female subjects [65%] participated in this study than males. The sickle cell anemia genotype (SCD-SS) constitutes the majority of sickle cell types in our study [77%]. The number of utilizations within 1 year of taking the pain assessment ranged widely from 0 to 38 events with a mean of 4.5. Utilization was also categorized into three groups (zero, low, high) where zero utilization was experienced by 19 subjects, 1–3 utilizations by 57 subjects and 4–38 utilizations by 56 subjects. CPI mean was recorded to be 40.7 with a wide range of 14.8–86.5.

Genotyping was performed for eight *TRPA1* SNPs and three *TRPV1* SNPs. Genotype and allele frequencies were presented in [Table 2](#T2), where SNPs are listed in order of chromosome position for the gene according to GenBank GRCh38 (Genome Reference Consortium human reference assembly). None of these SNPs deviated significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). All three *TRPV1* SNPs are nonsynonymous, whereas only one *TRPA1* SNP is nonsynonymous. The major allele and minor allele are noted because all analyses were performed with the major allele as the reference.

*TRPA1* rs920829 genotypes were statistically significantly associated with utilization (acute pain) in the both the additive and recessive model for negative binomial regression analysis (incident rate ratio = 1.44 [95% CI: 1.02–2.04], 1.68 [95% CI: 1.15–2.48]; p = 0.027, 0.008) ([Table 3](#T3)). The AA and AG genotypes showed a 68% increase in the rate of utilization over the major homozygous GG genotype. Also, each A allele contributed to a 44% increase in utilization rate. The dominant model did not yield a significant association (incident rate ratio = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.35–2.11]; p = 0.656). These analyses show an association of *TRPA1* SNPs with utilization counts, however, none of the three nonsynonymous SNPs in *TRPV1* gene showed significant association with utilization in our study ([Tables 3](#T3) & [4](#T4)). None of the SNPs in *TRPV1* and *TRPA1* showed statistically significant associations with CPI ([Table 5](#T5)).

Upon reanalyzing our data with four more subjects of Caucasian and Hispanic ethnicity, who had earlier been excluded from the analysis, we observed a trend for decrease in CPI associated with the G allele of *TRPV1* SNP rs222747 in the additive multiple linear regression model (B = -4.67 [95% CI: -9.50–0.15]; p = 0.058). However, dominant and recessive models did not show any trend. In this extended cohort (n = 136), SNP rs920829 still exhibited significant association with the utilization rate in the additive (p = 0.027) and recessive models (p = 0.008).

An LD analysis was further performed for eight *TRPA1* SNPs ([Figure 1](#F0001)A) and three *TRPV1* SNPs ([Figure 1](#F0001)B) in the extended cohort. *TRPV1* SNPs do not show any significant LD among them. *TRPA1* contains one haplotype block spanning 17 kb with five SNPs (rs1025928–rs3735942–rs3735943–rs920829–rs1443952). A haplotype analysis was performed with these *TRPA1* SNPs in LD as shown in [Table 6](#T6). A logistic regression was performed for haplotypes and utilization groups where utilization was divided into 0 versus 1 or more and 0–3 versus 4 or more numbers of utilization. A significant association was found for haplotype CGAGG (odds ratio = 0.218, p = 0.009) when analyzed for 0–3 versus 4 or more utilizations. This haplotype contains the rs920829 G allele and rs1025928 C allele. Taken together, these data suggest that *TRPA1* gene polymorphisms and haplotypes may contribute to the heterogeneity of acute pain in SCD.

## Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the potential role of the TRP channel gene polymorphisms with the acute pain crisis and chronic pain in SCD patients. We observed an association of *TRPA1* polymorphism and haplotype with acute care utilization due to painful crises in SCD patients. Notably, *TRPA1* rs920829 AA/AG genotypes showed 1.68-times the utilization rate of GG genotype (p = 0.008). Haplotype analyses revealed that the CGAGG haplotype of *TRPA1* containing rs920829 was associated with decreased odds of utilization (p = 0.009), which is consistent with the findings from single SNP analyses with rs920829 and rs1025928. The three *TRPV1* polymorphisms were not found to be associated with either utilization or CPI in our study.

Genetic polymorphisms of TRP channels have been studied in associations with several other neuropathic pain states. Binder *et al*. assessed the role of *TRPA1* and *TRPV1* polymorphisms in modulating the somatosensory function in neuropathic pain patients in a German cohort and found that GA and AA genotypes of *TRPA1* rs920829 were associated with less paradoxical heat sensation [[18](#B18)]. In another study, the A allele was associated with less paradoxical heat sensation in neuropathic pain patients [[39](#B39)]. In this study, we determined the frequencies of acute pain crisis in SCD by monitoring the number of utilization of emergency department and/or acute care center events. We are conducting a new study with quantitative sensory testing that will determine thermal and mechanical sensitivities in patients with SCD, so it will be interesting to see whether this SNP also influences heat sensation in SCD.

We only found a trend for decreased pain as measured by CPI in subjects with *TRPV1* rs222747 G allele. Subjects with *TRPV1* rs222747 CC genotype were reported to have a lower risk of epigastric pain syndrome in Japanese patients with functional dyspepsia [[19](#B19)]. In phenotypic subpopulations with preserved sensory function, G allele of *TRPV1* rs222747 was found to be associated with cold hypesthesia [[18](#B18)]. In the same study, *TRPV1* rs8065080 G allele was associated with less heat hyperalgesia, less pinprick hyperalgesia and less mechanical hypesthesia, and G allele of *TRPV1* rs222747 with cold hypesthesia in patients with neuropathic pain [[18](#B18)]. In another study to investigate the relative contributions and interactions of gender, ethnicity, psychological and genetic factors on pain sensitivity in humans, it was found that female European–Americans with the *TRPV1* rs8065080 G allele showed less cold sensitivity with longer cold-withdrawal times [[40](#B40)]. We did not see any association of rs8065080 with any pain phenotypes. In a Spanish population-based study, T allele of *TRPV1* rs222741 was associated with higher risk of migraine [[20](#B20)]. *TRPA1* rs11988795 A allele carriers are shown to have less pain tolerance to the cold stimuli and to enhance cold pain perception [[41](#B41)].

TRPV1 and TRPA1 are both Ca^2+^-permeable channels that respond to different stimuli. TRPV1 is mostly localized on small diameter nociceptive neurons, likely to be unmyelinated C-fibers [[42](#B42)]. Studies using *TRPV1-/-* mice showed that TRPV1 contributed to acute thermal nociception and hyperalgesia after tissue injury [[43](#B43)]. More recently, participation of TRPV1 in transducing and mediating responses to mechanical stimuli has also been implicated in inflamed bladder or colon, bone cancer pain and after nerve injury or cutaneous inflammation [[44](#B44),[45](#B45)]. TRPA1 bears 20% homology to TRPV1 on the peptide level and is coexpressed with TRPV1 in a subpopulation of unmyelinated nociceptive neurons. TRPA1 has been reported to mediate cold sensitivity in various neuropathic and inflammatory states [[46–48](#B46)], and its contributing functions in noxious cold transduction under naive conditions have been debated recently [[12](#B12),[14](#B14)].

There are limited studies on functions of TRP channels in SCD pain. In a mouse model of severe SCD, SCD mice exhibited persistent hypersensitivity to mechanical, heat and cold stimuli. Mechanical sensitization of nociceptors at the terminal level in skin and at the membrane level in isolated somata was completely reversed, whereas mechanical allodynia was partially reversed by acute pharmacologic inhibition of the TRPV1 channel [[17](#B17)]. However, the roles of TRPV1 and TRPA1 in other pain phenotypes in SCD have not been examined in animal models or in clinical studies.

We have proposed a role of cold weather in precipitating pain in SCD patients with allodynic and hyperalgesic quality due to the development of neuropathic pain [[49](#B49)]. Combined with our observations in this study that *TRPA1* polymorphism and haplotype are associated with utilizations characterized by acute painful crisis in SCD patients, it might be explained by the contributing function of TRPA1 in cold pain transduction under neuropathic pain conditions. To further elucidate the results, we have in this study, a standardized quantitative sensory testing will certainly be useful to examine the association of cold sensation in SCD patients with different *TRPA1* polymorphism and haplotype.

There are limitations in our study. Although it would have been insightful to further analyze results according to all SCD types, we did not have a sufficient number of subjects with β^+^ thalassemia or β^0^ thalassemia to make this approach meaningful. Findings from the current study may also be limited by the sample size; therefore, a large, multicenter, prospective study is needed to replicate the results.

To our knowledge, the current study is the first report to demonstrate an association between *TRPA1* gene polymorphisms and pain in SCD. The present data suggest that *TRPA1* rs920829 710G>A polymorphism and CGAGG haplotype are associated with an increased number of pain crisis in patients with SCD. Therefore, *TRPA1* polymorphisms may contribute to the heterogeneity of acute crisis pain in SCD.

## Conclusion

*TRPA1* polymorphisms may contribute to the heterogeneity of acute crisis pain in SCD. *TRPA1* rs920829 710G>A allele and CGAGG haplotype are associated with increased frequencies of acute crisis pain in patients with SCD.
