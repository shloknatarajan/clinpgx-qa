## Abstract

Rasburicase for the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome has been associated with hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia, usually in patients with G6PD deficiency. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to use of rasburicase in at‐risk patients. Methylene blue will worsen the hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficiency and should be avoided.

Keywords: Hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, rasburicase, tumor lysis syndrome

## Commentary

This patient presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a significant leukocytosis. In the course of his work up, he developed acute kidney injury. While the patient had multiple plausible etiologies for his worsening renal function, due to the concern for underlying malignancy, TLS was suspected. In 2004, the Cairo‐Bishop [1](#ccr3495-bib-0001) laboratory diagnostic criteria (Table [1](#ccr3495-tbl-0001)) and grading system for TLS severity (Table [2](#ccr3495-tbl-0002)) were proposed. Our patient met two of the four criteria, which would be consistent with a diagnosis of TLS, and his rise in creatinine would classify his TLS as grade 3.

### Table 1.

|   | Value | Change from baseline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Uric acid | ≥476 μmol/L (8 mg/dL) | 25% increase |
| Potassium | ≥6.0 mmol/L (or 6 mEq/L) | 25% increase |
| Phosphorous | ≥1.45 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL) for adults | 25% increase |
| Calcium | ≤1.75 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) | 25% decrease |

### Table 2.

| Complication | Grade 0 | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Grade 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creatinine | <1.5 ULN | 1.5 × ULN | >1.5–3.0 × ULN | >3.0–6.0 × ULN | >6.0 × ULN | Death |
| Cardiac arrhythmia | None | Intervention not indicated | Nonurgent medical intervention indicated | Symptomatic and not adequately controlled | Life‐threatening | Death |
| Seizure | None | – | Brief seizure, well controlled | Seizure with LOC or poorly controlled | Prolonged, repeated seizures | Death |

Since the use of rasburicase began, we are aware of 15 reported cases of methemoglobinemia with or without associated hemolysis (Table [3](#ccr3495-tbl-0003)) [2](#ccr3495-bib-0002), [3](#ccr3495-bib-0003), [4](#ccr3495-bib-0004), [5](#ccr3495-bib-0005), [6](#ccr3495-bib-0006), [7](#ccr3495-bib-0007), [8](#ccr3495-bib-0008), [9](#ccr3495-bib-0009), [10](#ccr3495-bib-0010), [11](#ccr3495-bib-0011), [12](#ccr3495-bib-0012), [13](#ccr3495-bib-0013), [14](#ccr3495-bib-0014). It was first reported in patients with G6PD deficiency [2](#ccr3495-bib-0002), but has also been seen in patients without G6PD deficiency [5](#ccr3495-bib-0005), [8](#ccr3495-bib-0008). The majority of cases are mild and treatment consists of supportive treatment with oxygen and red blood cell transfusions. Death has occurred in two cases [10](#ccr3495-bib-0010), [13](#ccr3495-bib-0013), one of which [10](#ccr3495-bib-0010) was notable for the use of methylene blue in a patient whose G6PD status was unknown, but was suspected to be deficient.

Table 3 Caption: Reported cases of rasburicase‐induced methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia

We treated our patient with double volume exchange transfusion, which has been employed in one other case with good results [6](#ccr3495-bib-0006). However, double volume exchange transfusion in our patient was logistically difficult given his size (BMI 63), requiring 5.1 L of packed red blood cells. He also required therapeutic plasma exchange for the removal of free plasma hemoglobin as a result of severe hemolytic anemia. Six months following the hospitalization when the transfused red blood cells were no longer circulating, our patient was confirmed to be G6PD deficient. Our case suggests that the severity of hemolysis and methemoglobinemia does not appear to be dose dependent, as our patient received 0.03 mg/kg of rasburicase in a single dose. Similarly, the patient in one of the reported deaths [10](#ccr3495-bib-0010) received two doses of 0.04 mg/kg.

Though typically well tolerated, rasburicase therapy has been associated with adverse reactions with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. To avoid rasburicase‐induced hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia, we would recommend screening all patients at risk for G6PD deficiency, including African Americans, prior to the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies with a high tumor burden. When TLS presents urgently and precludes screening, clinicians should weigh risks and benefits prior to using rasburicase in at risk populations. In patients at risk for G6PD deficiency who cannot be screened, close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and oxygen saturation is warranted following rasburicase administration. If methemoglobinemia and hemolysis are observed, patients should be assumed to be G6PD deficient and should not receive methylene blue. In severe cases, red cell exchange transfusion has been used twice with good results. More recently, ascorbic acid [11](#ccr3495-bib-0011), [12](#ccr3495-bib-0012), [13](#ccr3495-bib-0013) has been used as an antioxidant with relatively few side effects and appears to be well tolerated.
