## Abstract

**Background:** 
Rivaroxaban is a first‐line agent for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment. However, its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and bleeding risk exhibit significant interindividual variability. Known nongenetic factors alone cannot fully explain this variability, and the impact of genetic polymorphisms remains debated.

**Methods:** 
From December 29, 2021, to May 11, 2023, 310 patients with venous thromboembolism treated with rivaroxaban were enrolled in this observational study from a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China, based on predefined criteria. We assessed relationships between rivaroxaban concentrations, anti‐Factor Xa levels, and coagulation parameters; examined the impact of 12 genes on concentrations and anti‐Factor Xa levels; and followed up for at least 3 months to identify bleeding risk factors.

**Results:** 
Rivaroxaban plasma concentration was significantly related to anti‐Factor Xa levels (R2=0.697), activated partial thromboplastin time (R2=0.134), prothrombin time (R2=0.123), and international normalized ratio (R2=0.116). Peak concentrations were associated with cytochrome p450 3A5 (rs776746, P=0.023), sushi domain‐containing protein 3 ( rs76292544, P=0.034), and ATP‐binding cassette subfamily G member 2 ( rs1045642, P=0.012); trough concentrations were linked to cytochrome p450 3A5 (rs776746, P=0.045), sushi domain‐containing protein 3 (rs76292544, P=0.014), and ATP‐binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (rs2231142, P=0.029); peak anti‐Factor Xa levels were associated with aldo‐keto reductase family 7 member A3 (rs1738023, P=0.022; rs1738025, P=0.035) and ATP‐binding cassette subfamily A member 6 (rs7212506, P=0.044). However, these genetic associations were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Hemorrhage risk factors were anemia, pulmonary embolism, and the TT genotype of sushi domain‐containing protein 3 (rs76292544).

**Conclusions:** 
Pharmacogenetic monitoring and hemorrhage risk assessment may contribute to optimize its efficacy and safety. Larger‐scale, global multicenter clinical trials are required to validate the potential gene loci for testing, including cytochrome p450 3A5 (rs776746), sushi domain‐containing protein 3 (rs76292544), ATP‐binding cassette transporter B1 (rs1045642), and ATP‐binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (rs2231124), with particular focus on sushi domain‐containing protein 3 (rs76292544).

### Background

Rivaroxaban is a first‐line agent for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment. However, its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and bleeding risk exhibit significant interindividual variability. Known nongenetic factors alone cannot fully explain this variability, and the impact of genetic polymorphisms remains debated.

### Methods

From December 29, 2021, to May 11, 2023, 310 patients with venous thromboembolism treated with rivaroxaban were enrolled in this observational study from a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China, based on predefined criteria. We assessed relationships between rivaroxaban concentrations, anti‐Factor Xa levels, and coagulation parameters; examined the impact of 12 genes on concentrations and anti‐Factor Xa levels; and followed up for at least 3 months to identify bleeding risk factors.

### Results

Rivaroxaban plasma concentration was significantly related to anti‐Factor Xa levels (R^2^=0.697), activated partial thromboplastin time (R^2^=0.134), prothrombin time (R^2^=0.123), and international normalized ratio (R^2^=0.116). Peak concentrations were associated with *cytochrome p450* *3A5* (rs776746, *P*=0.023), *sushi domain‐containing protein 3* ( rs76292544, *P*=0.034), and *ATP‐binding cassette subfamily G member 2* ( rs1045642, *P*=0.012); trough concentrations were linked to *cytochrome p450* *3A5* (rs776746, *P*=0.045), *sushi domain‐containing protein 3* (rs76292544, *P*=0.014), and *ATP‐binding cassette subfamily G member 2* (rs2231142, *P*=0.029); peak anti‐Factor Xa levels were associated with *aldo‐keto reductase family 7 member A3* (rs1738023, *P*=0.022; rs1738025, *P*=0.035) and *ATP‐binding cassette subfamily A member 6* (rs7212506, *P*=0.044). However, these genetic associations were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Hemorrhage risk factors were anemia, pulmonary embolism, and the TT genotype of *sushi domain‐containing protein 3* (rs76292544).

### Conclusions

Pharmacogenetic monitoring and hemorrhage risk assessment may contribute to optimize its efficacy and safety. Larger‐scale, global multicenter clinical trials are required to validate the potential gene loci for testing, including *cytochrome p450* *3A5* (rs776746), *sushi domain‐containing protein 3* (rs76292544), *ATP‐binding cassette transporter B1* (rs1045642), and *ATP‐binding cassette subfamily G member 2* (rs2231124), with particular focus on *sushi domain‐containing protein 3* (rs76292544).

### Study Design

This was an observational study conducted at Ruijin Hospital. The study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Ruijin Hospital (KY‐2022‐161). All participants enrolled in the study provided informed consent. The demographic information and biochemical data were extracted from the patients' electronic medical records.

From December 29, 2021 to May 11, 2023, a total of 340 patients were screened on the basis of the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age >16 years; (2) diagnosis of VTE, including PE, DVT, and DVT; (3) administration of rivaroxaban; and (4) detection of the concentration of rivaroxaban. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) severely impaired renal function with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min; (2) coadministration of strong and moderate CYP3A and P‐gP inducers or inhibitors such as rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, ritonavir, posaconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole; and (3) incomplete medical information.

### Outcomes

All patients were followed for at least 3 months to record the incidence of hemorrhage events. The primary outcome was the effects of 12 monitored genetic variants on rivaroxaban concentration and hemorrhage event. Secondary outcomes were as follows: (1) risk factors for hemorrhage event; (2) the correlation between concentration and anti‐FXa level; (3) the correlation between concentration and coagulation factor levels; and (4) effects of 12 monitored genetic variants on peak anti‐FXa level.

### Plasma Level of Rivaroxaban and Anti‐Xa Activity

All blood samples were collected after rivaroxaban reached a steady state concentration. Samples for trough and peak level detection were collected 0.5 to 1 hours before and 2 to 4 hours after rivaroxaban administration, respectively. After centrifugation, the plasma concentrations were detected via validated high‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The anti‐FXa activity was measured with a chromogenic assay.

### Genetic Testing

The EDTA‐anticoagulated samples used for genetic testing were used for rivaroxaban concentration measurement. Genomic DNA was first extracted via a nucleic acid extraction kit via the magnetic bead method. The Sanger method of dideoxy DNA sequencing was subsequently adopted for genotyping. The variants of *ABCB1* (rs4148738, rs2032582, rs1045642, rs1128503), *ABCG2* (rs2231142), *CYP3A4* (rs35599367), *CYP3A5* (rs776746), *CYP2J2* (rs890293), *ABCA6* (rs7212506), *AKR7A3* (rs1738023, rs1738025) and *SUSD3* (rs76292544) were examined as potential genetic determinants of rivaroxaban concentration and anti‐FXa activity.

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 25; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables with a normal distribution are represented as the means± SEM, and nonnormally distributed continuous variables are presented as medians with interquartile ranges. Categorical variables are expressed as n (%). The allele frequencies of the studied genotypes were evaluated via the chi‐square test to assess whether they deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Correlations between rivaroxaban concentration and anti‐FXa level or coagulation parameters were first assessed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test, followed by linear regression analysis. The Kruskal–Wallis test or Mann–Whitney test was used to compare differences in continuous variables as appropriate. To control the family‐wise error rate, multiple comparisons were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction, setting the statistical significance threshold at *P*=0.0042 (0.05/12). Differences in variables between the groups without and with hemorrhage were analyzed via the chi‐square test or Mann–Whitney test as appropriate. All variables with *P* value <0.1 were incorporated into the binary logistic regression model using an enter manner. A *P* value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## RESULTS

### Baseline Characteristics of the Studied Cohort

During the study period, 310 patients were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as shown in Figure [1](#jah310938-fig-0001). The demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table [1](#jah310938-tbl-0001). The ages of the participants in the study cohort ranged from 25 to 94 years. Approximately 50% of patients were diagnosed with PE, and 35.5% of patients were simultaneously diagnosed with PE and DVT. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity. At the time of concentration monitoring, rivaroxaban was administered daily at dosages of 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg in 17.7%, 17.4%, 36.5%, and 28.4% of patients, respectively.

### Correlation Between Rivaroxaban Concentrations and Anti‐FXa and Coagulation Factor Levels

Rivaroxaban is a selective and direct inhibitor of FXa that plays key roles in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways by activating downstream thrombin and clot formation. Through Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test, we demonstrated that the anti‐FXa level, activated partial thromboplastin time, PT, international normalized ratio, and thrombin time (TT) were affected by rivaroxaban concentration (Table [2](#jah310938-tbl-0002)). As shown in Figure [2](#jah310938-fig-0002), there was a significant positive correlation between the rivaroxaban concentration and the anti‐FXa level, with R^2^=0.697 (*P*<0.0001). The rivaroxaban concentration was also positively correlated with activated partial thromboplastin time, PT, and the international normalized ratio, with an R^2^ value of approximately 0.12 (*P*<0.0001). A negative correlation was found between the rivaroxaban concentration and TT, with a relatively small R^2^ value of 0.018 (*P*=0.011).

### Table 2.

|   | Spearman's rho | P value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| anti‐FXa level | 0.835 | <0.0001 |
| Activated partial thromboplastin time | 0.365 | <0.0001 |
| Prothrombin time | 0.338 | <0.0001 |
| International normalized ratio | 0.34 | <0.0001 |
| Thrombin time | −0.133 | 0.011 |

anti‐FXa indicates anti‐Factor Xa.

### Genetic Variants Influenced Peak and Trough Rivaroxaban Concentrations

In our study, the influences of all possible rivaroxaban‐related drug metabolic enzymes, transporters, and other reported genetic polymorphisms on peak and trough plasma concentrations were comprehensively explored. As shown in Table [3](#jah310938-tbl-0003), no statistically significant evidence of deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed for the allele frequencies of the studied genotypes following evaluation of chi‐square test. Analysis revealed association between peak concentration and variants of *ABCB1* (rs1045642, *P*=0.012), *CYP3A5* (rs776746, *P*=0.023), and *SUSD3* (rs76292544, *P*=0.034) (Figure [3](#jah310938-fig-0003)). Post hoc pairwise comparisons demonstrated that patients carrying *ABCB1* AG genotype, *CYP3A5* C allele, and *SUSD3* TT genotype exhibited significantly higher peak concentration compared with those with GG genotype, noncarriers, and AA genotype respectively (Table [4](#jah310938-tbl-0004)). Analysis of trough concentration revealed differences among *CYP3A5* (rs776746, *P*=0.045), *SUSD3* (rs76292544, *P*=0.014), and *ABCG2* (rs2231124, *P*=0.029) (Figure [3](#jah310938-fig-0003)). Post hoc pairwise comparisons showed that individuals carrying *CYP3A5* TT genotype, *SUSD3* A allele, and *ABCG2* TT genotype had lower trough concentration compared with those with CT genotype, noncarriers, and GT genotype respectively (Table [4](#jah310938-tbl-0004)). However, these associations did not remain statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

Table 4 Caption: Post Hoc Pairwise Comparisons of Genetic Variants on Peak Concentration, Trough Concentration, and Peak Anti‐Xa Levels

Genetic variants of both *CYP3A5* (rs776746) and *SUSD3* (rs76292544) exhibited associations with both peak and trough concentrations. Analysis of rivaroxaban dosage across different genotype of *CYP3A5* (rs776746), *SUSD3* (rs76292544), *ABCB1* (rs1045642), and *ABCG2* (rs2231142) revealed no statistically significant differences, as presented in Table [S1](#jah310938-supitem-0001). The other unmentioned genetic polymorphisms had no effect on peak or trough concentrations.

### Genetic Variants Influenced the Peak Anti‐FXa Level

Peak anti‐FXa levels were association with genetic variants in *AKR7A3* (rs1738023, *P*=0.022; rs1738025, *P*=0.035) and *ABCA6* (rs7212506, *P*=0.044) (Figure [4](#jah310938-fig-0004)). However, these associations also did not remain statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Compared with individuals with TT genotype, those carrying *AKR7A3* (rs1738023) CC genotype exhibited lower anti‐FXa levels, whereas carriers of *ABCA6* T allele exhibited higher levels compared with noncarriers. Post hoc pairwise comparisons did not show significant differences in *AKR7A3* (rs1738025). With the exception of these 3 genes, the other genetic polymorphisms had no effects on peak anti‐FXa levels. Due to the limited sample size, we were unable to conduct a statistical analysis of the relationship between genetic effects and trough anti‐FXa level.

### Risk Factors for Hemorrhage in Patients With VTE

The incidence of hemorrhage in our study was 27.05%. All hemorrhagic adverse drug reactions were evaluated and attributed to rivaroxaban. Importantly, no patients experiencing bleeding concurrently received other medications known to increase the risk of hemorrhage, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. With the aim of identifying risk factors for bleeding events, we divided the enrolled patients into groups without and with hemorrhage and conducted univariate and multivariable analyses. The demographic and clinical characteristics of these 2 groups are shown in Table [5](#jah310938-tbl-0005). Statistically significant differences were found with respect to age, *ABCB1* (rs4148738, rs2032582, rs1045642), and *SUSD3* (rs76292544). All variables with *P*<0.1 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The results of binary logistic regression analysis revealed that anemia, the TT variant of *SUSD3* (rs76292544), and PE were independently related to a higher rate of hemorrhage (Table [6](#jah310938-tbl-0006)).

## DISCUSSION

In real‐world clinical practice, direct oral anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban, are gradually replacing traditional vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin because rivaroxaban is orally administered at fixed dosages without the need to monitor coagulation parameters regularly. However, large‐scale randomized clinical trials involving rivaroxaban failed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety superiority over standard therapy (low‐molecular‐weight heparin alone or in combination with a vitamin K antagonist) in patients with VTE. In adult patients with symptomatic VTE, the rates of recurrence and clinically relevant bleeding for rivaroxaban and standard therapy are 2.1% versus 3.0% and 8.1% versus 8.1%, respectively.[22](#jah310938-bib-0022) In adult patients with PE, the incidences of recurrence and clinically relevant hemorrhage for rivaroxaban and standard therapy are 2.1% versus 1.8% and 10.3% versus 11.4%, respectively.[23](#jah310938-bib-0023) In children with acute VTE, the efficacy and safety results are similar to those in adult patients (1.2% versus 3.0% and 3.0% versus 1.9%).[24](#jah310938-bib-0024) In high‐risk ambulatory patients with cancer, rivaroxaban also failed to exhibit any superiority in thromboprophylaxis in the 180‐day trial period.[25](#jah310938-bib-0025) In addition, the coefficient of variation for the rivaroxaban concentration is as high as 45%. The population pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in real‐world patients indicated that interindividual variabilities in the absorption rate constant, apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution were 14%, 24%, and 29.3%, respectively.[26](#jah310938-bib-0026) Consequently, an increasing number of guidelines suggest performing therapeutical drug monitoring and providing recommended concentration ranges to improve rivaroxaban efficacy and safety.

Genetic variations in metabolic enzymes and transporters have been recognized as the primary risk factors for individual differences in various drugs, which is also applicable to oral anticoagulants. Warfarin, a pioneer among oral anticoagulants, has been extensively studied for its pharmacogenetic variability. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has issued guidelines since 2011 recommending dose adjustments based on genetic variants in *CYP2C9*, *vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1*, *CYP4F2*, and rs12777823.[27](#jah310938-bib-0027) Despite growing interest in genotype‐guided personalizing dosing of direct oral anticoagulants, strong evidence supporting the clinical utility of pharmacogenomics test remains insufficient due to a paucity of large‐scale, well‐designed clinical trials. Published pharmacogenomics studies also have primarily centered on gene encoding drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. These include *ABCB1*, *carboxylesterase 1*, *solute carrier family 22 member 1* in relation to dabigatran; *ABCB1*, *CYP3A5*, and *ABCG2* in relation to rivaroxaban and apixaban; and *ABCB1*, *solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1* in relation to edoxaban.[28](#jah310938-bib-0028), [29](#jah310938-bib-0029) For rivaroxaban, our results indicated that peak concentrations were associated with polymorphisms of *CYP3A5* (rs776746), *SUSD3* (rs76292544), and *ABCB1* (rs1045642) and that trough concentrations were associated with polymorphisms of *CYP3A5* (rs776746), *SUSD3* (rs76292544), and *ABCG2* (rs2231124). However, to our knowledge, few studies have investigated the effects of both peak and trough concentrations simultaneously. Proteins encoded by these identified genes are primary metabolic enzymes and transporters for rivaroxaban, which are closely associated with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. *CYP3A5* (rs776746) has effects on both peak and trough concentrations. One meta‐analysis also demonstrated that the rivaroxaban concentration was influenced by *CYP3A5* (rs776746), which is identical to our results.[30](#jah310938-bib-0030) In Russian patients with DVT, there was a significant correlation between the activity of *CYP3A* and the peak and trough rivaroxaban concentrations.[31](#jah310938-bib-0031) However, a study of Chinese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation reported no effect of *CYP3A5* on C_trough_/dose.[32](#jah310938-bib-0032) Moreover, *CYP3A5* (rs776746) has also been demonstrated to influence the pharmacokinetics of other anticoagulants. Specially, it increases the oral clearance of apixaban in Japanese patients[33](#jah310938-bib-0033) and prolonging half‐life of dabigatran in White and Latin American patients.[34](#jah310938-bib-0034) With respect to *CYP3A4* (rs35599367), we failed to find effects on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics because only 1 patient carried the *CYP3A4* (rs35599367) mutation. According to published studies, *ABCB1* (rs1045642) has an effect on trough concentration,[11](#jah310938-bib-0011), [13](#jah310938-bib-0013), [16](#jah310938-bib-0016) which is identical to our results. In Russian patients, *ABCB1* (rs1045642) also significantly affectts dabigatran peak concentration not trough concentration.[35](#jah310938-bib-0035) Single marker analysis study also failed to identify a relationship between *ABCB1* (rs1128503, rs2032582) and apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran pharmacokinetics.[33](#jah310938-bib-0033), [36](#jah310938-bib-0036), [37](#jah310938-bib-0037), [38](#jah310938-bib-0038), [39](#jah310938-bib-0039) Interestingly, another transporter gene, *ABCG2* (rs2231124), had effects on the trough but not the peak concentration of rivaroxaban in our study but affected both trough and peak concentrations of apixaban of European patients.[40](#jah310938-bib-0040) In healthy individuals, the peak concentration of a single dose of rivaroxaban is affected by the *ABCG2* polymorphism.[41](#jah310938-bib-0041) To our knowledge, this is the first report of the significant effect of *SUSD3* (rs76292544) on peak and trough concentrations. To realize the potential of personalized rivaroxaban therapy, additional larger‐scale, multinational clinical trials are still needed to validate our findings and extend their applicability to diverse populations. The establishment of robust, evidence‐based guidelines will enable the implementation of genetic‐guided individualized dosing, thereby mirroring the success of warfarin pharmacogenetics.

FXa functions as a key factor in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways by activating the downstream pathways of thrombin and clot formation. In Asian populations administered rivaroxaban (149) and dabigatran (122), the activity of anti‐FXa‐IIa was recommended as an effective index for pharmacodynamic evaluation.[42](#jah310938-bib-0042) The universal low‐molecular‐weight‐heparin‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay was reported to correctly predict the concentration of rivaroxaban.[43](#jah310938-bib-0043) We also found a strong association between the anti‐FXa antibody level and the rivaroxaban concentration. An anti‐FXa level of 100 to 300 ng/mL is considered a risk factor for increased odds of major bleeding.[44](#jah310938-bib-0044) In patients with acute kidney injury receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban, anti‐FXa level monitoring significantly reduces the incidence of major bleeding.[45](#jah310938-bib-0045) However, data concerning the factors affecting the anti‐FXa activities of patients treated with rivaroxaban are insufficient. We found that peak anti‐FXa levels were associated with variants of *AKR7A3* (rs1738023, rs1738025) and *ABCA6* (rs7212506). Owing to the limited sample size, we were unable to detect their effects on trough anti‐FXa levels, which is a limitation of this study. AKR7A is an important enzyme involved primarily in the bioactivation and detoxification of aldehydes and ketones. Acetaminophen‐induced oxidative stress and hepatoxicity can be alleviated by AKR7A through the regulation of the *Nrf2* (nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2) signaling pathway.[46](#jah310938-bib-0046) ABCA6 is a member of the ABC superfamily that transports various molecules across the extracellular and intracellular membranes. One study involving whole‐exome sequencing revealed that homozygous mutations in *AKR7A3* and *ABCA6* were strongly associated with the continuous accumulation of activated rivaroxaban and toxic substances.[12](#jah310938-bib-0012) We speculated that the effects of *AKR7A3* and *ABCA6* variants on anti‐FXa may be induced by alterations in drug metabolism and transport. Unfortunately, this study failed to identify their direct effects on the rivaroxaban concentration.

Bleeding is the most common adverse drug reaction and the most common reason for discontinuing medication. The incidence of hemorrhage in this study was 27.05%. By binary logistic regression analysis, we demonstrated that the comorbidity of anemia, the TT variant of *SUSD3* (rs76292544), and PE are independent risk factors for adverse bleeding effects. In Korean patients, anemia is also significantly associated with bleeding events after the administration of direct oral anticoagulants.[47](#jah310938-bib-0047) The comorbidity of anemia was also identified as a risk factor for gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a meta‐analysis of anticoagulants, including but not limited to rivaroxaban.[48](#jah310938-bib-0048) Taken together, these data suggest that more attention should be paid to patients with anemia receiving anticoagulants to monitor for bleeding events. In Chinese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, *SUSD3* (rs76292544) was also significantly associated with hemorrhage events at 12 months.[14](#jah310938-bib-0014) To our knowledge, our study is the second published study to explore the effect of *SUSD3* on hemorrhage. The protein encoded by *SUSD3* is located in the plasma membrane and may be involved in rivaroxaban transport. Alterations in pharmacokinetics may further affect the incidence of hemorrhage. PE is defined as occlusion in the pulmonary arterial tree, which prevents blood flow distal to the occlusion. It is most frequently caused by thrombosis in a systemic blood vessel, especially in a deep vein of the lower limb.[49](#jah310938-bib-0049) An increasing number of experts have reported that PE and DVT are similar but differ in terms of patient characteristics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes.[50](#jah310938-bib-0050) The risk of bleeding events in patients with PE and DVT was indeed different in our study. On the basis of these findings, patients with these risk factors should be more cautious in the administration of rivaroxaban. One systematic review and network meta‐analysis of phase III randomized controlled trials indicated that apixaban and dabigatran posed significantly lower risks for clinical bleeding than rivaroxaban did, without significant differences in the risks of VTE and VTE‐related death.[51](#jah310938-bib-0051) Apixaban and dabigatran are alternative options for patients with a high risk of bleeding.

This study has some limitations. First, the simultaneous exploration of associations between 12 genetic variants and rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and bleeding risk resulted in insufficient sample size, which compromised statistical power and precluded the ability to meet Bonferroni correction thresholds for multiple testing. Consequently, validation of statistically significant genetic loci necessitates further large‐scale independent cohort studies. Second, the broad age range of the study population coupled with the limited sample size introduced heterogeneity that hindered the analysis of age‐related interactions. Further studies should focus on stratified analyses across different age groups to elucidate potential age‐related interactions. Third, the extremely low mutation frequencies of certain loci, combined with population‐specific genetic diversity, may have obscured nuanced associations. Comprehensive, multiple‐ethnic studies with expanded sample sizes are required to address these limitations and improve the generalizability of our findings.

## CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, our study revealed that the rivaroxaban concentration was strongly related to the anti‐FXa level, activated partial thromboplastin time, PT, and international normalized ratio. Genetic variants of *CYP3A5* (rs776746), *SUSD3* (rs76292544), *ABCB1* (rs1045642), and *ABCG2* (rs2231124) were associated with the peak and trough concentrations. The anti‐FXa antibody levels are associated with polymorphisms of *AKR7A3* (rs1738023) and *ABCA6* (rs7212506). Anemia, the TT variant of *SUSD3* (rs76292544), and PE were found to be independent risk factors for hemorrhage. Considering variations in genotype frequencies among patients from different biogeographic groups, we recommend that pharmacogenetic monitoring and risk assessment of hemorrhage before rivaroxaban administration could help optimize its efficacy and safety in Chinese patients. Larger‐scale, global multicenter clinical trials are required to validate the potential gene loci for testing, including *CYP3A5* (rs776746), *SUSD3* (rs76292544), *ABCB1* (rs1045642), and *ABCG2* (rs2231124), with particular focus on *SUSD3* (rs76292544).
