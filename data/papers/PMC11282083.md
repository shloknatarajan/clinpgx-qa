## Abstract

Cephalosporin antibiotics are widely used in clinical settings, but they can cause hypersensitivity reactions, which may be influenced by genetic factors such as the expression of Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. This study aimed to investigate whether specific HLA alleles were associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions to cephalosporins among individuals in the Taiwanese population. This retrospective case–control study analyzed data from the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI) on 27,933 individuals who received cephalosporin exposure and had HLA allele genotyping information available. Using logistic regression analyses, we examined the associations between HLA genotypes, comorbidities, allergy risk, and severity. Among the study population, 278 individuals had cephalosporin allergy and 2780 were in the control group. Our results indicated that certain HLA alleles, including HLA-B*55:02 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.18–2.61, p = 0.005), HLA-C*01:02 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.05–1.77, p = 0.018), and HLA-DQB1*06:09 (OR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.62–4.12, p < 0.001), were significantly associated with an increased risk of cephalosporin allergy reactions. Additionally, the HLA-C*01:02 allele genotype was significantly associated with a higher risk of severe allergy (OR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.05–5.15, p = 0.04). This study identified significant associations between HLA alleles and an increased risk of cephalosporin allergy, which can aid in early detection and prediction of adverse drug reactions to cephalosporins. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of HLA typing in drug safety and expanding our knowledge of drug hypersensitivity syndromes.

## Introduction

The use of cephalosporin antibiotics in medical treatments is widespread and continues to increase^1^. They are commonly prescribed to treat infections like pneumonia, cellulitis, and otitis media. In addition, they are often administered as a preventative measure for various surgical procedures^2^. Despite their usefulness, cephalosporins can cause a range of allergic reactions, varying from mild skin reactions to life-threatening anaphylaxis. As a result, early detection and prediction can be beneficial, especially for patients without a history of allergic reactions^3^.

Identifying and testing strategies for cephalosporin allergy are challenging due to a lack of consistent antigenic determinants^4,5^. Various models have been suggested to clarify how immune responses are activated, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules have been shown to play a significant role in these models^6^.

Several studies have demonstrated that certain HLA genes increase the risk of drug hypersensitivity reactions. For instance, avoiding carbamazepine therapy in individuals carrying the HLA-B*15:02 allele has been associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of carbamazepine-induced Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)^7^. Similarly, a strong association between HLA-B*58:01 and allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) has been observed in Hong Kong Han Chinese patients^8^. Despite the substantial progress made in enhancing drug safety and advancing our understanding of immunopathogenesis of drug hypersensitivity syndromes via identification of HLA associations, no research studies have been adequately powered to specifically investigate the genetic factors that increase the risk of cephalosporin allergy. The aim of this investigation was to employ a hospital-derived database to detect any HLA genetic predisposition among individuals in the Taiwanese population who have encountered unfavorable drug reactions to cephalosporins.

## Materials and methods

### Study design and data source

During this hospital-based retrospective case–control study, researchers analyzed data from the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI) that included a total of 58,091 participants in Taiwan. The study, which collected electronic health records and specimens, was conducted from June 2019 to December 2021 at the Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH). Of the total participants, 27,933 patients had received cephalosporin and their genetic profiles were linked to their medical claims data at TCVGH, which included information on demographics, procedures, diagnoses, surgeries, and medication prescriptions. The study was approved by the Taichung Veterans General Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB no. CE23154C) and all participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### HLA allele typing

Our study included 27,933 participants, from whom we collected DNA samples via a 2 ml venous blood sample. We used the NXType™ Class I NGS HLA typing kit and the AllType™ NGS 11-Loci Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to identify the 8 major HLA Class I loci, including HLA-A, -B, -C, and the Class II loci, including -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DRB1. We then processed the obtained sequences using Axiom HLA Analysis 1.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), which utilizes advanced imputation methods to provide precise HLA typing from SNP genotype data over the extended MHC region.

### HLA imputation for genotype data

For HLA genes HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1, we used the R library HLA Genotype Imputation with the Attribute Bagging (HIBAG) package^9^ to perform HLA imputation. The imputation model was designed specifically for individuals of Asian descent^10^. The resulting imputed data showed two-field (4-digit) resolution for HLA alleles with allele frequencies (AFs) of 5.0% or greater.

### Participants

This study collected data from electronic medical records of individuals who claimed to have or exhibited a cephalosporin allergy, along with their associated symptoms. The study only included individuals over the age of 18 who had received cephalosporin exposure and had HLA allele genotyping information available. A total of 27,933 individuals with cephalosporin exposure were included in the study, with 278 individuals in the cephalosporin allergy group (who reported adverse drug reactions) and 2780 individuals in the cephalosporin non-allergy group (who did not report any adverse drug reactions). The two groups were matched by age and gender in a ratio of 1:10. Supplementary Fig. [1](#MOESM1) provides additional information about the matching process.

Allergy cases were identified through a specific section in the electronic medical records that documents all food and drug allergies. Drug classifications were as per Supplementary Table [1](#MOESM2). Cases were recorded through direct observation by medical staff or from patient history in previous medical records. ICD codes were not used to identify allergy cases but were employed to recognize comorbid conditions. Adverse events related to allergies were also documented in the designated section of the records, though not all events were consistently recorded. Only documented events were analyzed for allergy severity. Individuals who encountered severe systemic reactions involving cardiovascular and/or respiratory systems (Grade III) were categorized as the severe allergy group, while those who experienced local reactions or systemic reactions without cardiovascular and/or respiratory involvement (Grade I/II) were classified as the mild allergy group^11^.

### Covariates

The diagnoses in this study were established based on codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and Tenth Revision (ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM). In order to be included in the study, patients needed to have either two outpatient diagnosis records or one inpatient diagnosis record between January 2009 and December 2021. Comorbidity information was obtained from the electronic health records of TCVGH and was identified using ICD-9 diagnostic codes specific to Asthma (ICD-9-CM code 493/ICD-10-CM code J45), Allergic rhinitis (ICD-9-CM code 477/ICD-10-CM code J30), Atopic dermatitis (ICD-9-CM code 691.8/ICD-10-CM code L20.8), Urticaria (ICD-9-CM code 708/ICD-10-CM code L50), and Autoimmune disease (ICD-9-CM code 710.0, 710.1, 710.2, 710.3, 710.4, 710.8, 714.0, 245.2, 245.9/ICD-10-CM code M32, M33, M34, M35, M05.9, E27.1, E27.40).

### Statistical analysis

The data in this study was analyzed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and percentage, were used to describe the basic characteristics of the participants across different groups. The chi-square test was used to assess the statistical significance of categorical variables. The univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between HLA genotypes and the risk of allergies, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) calculated. The final model included significant covariates, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results

### Demographic and clinical features of participants

The study recruited 3058 participants, including 2024 men and 1034 women who were genotyped for 8 major HLA alleles, as shown as Table [1](#Tab1). The participants had an average age of 59 ± 17 years. There were no significant differences in sex, age, or BMI between the two groups. The prevalence of autoimmune diseases was higher in the cephalosporin allergy group than in the control group with a statistically significant difference (27 v.s. 21.2%, p = 0.032). However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of other allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and angioedema between the two groups.

### HLA genotyping and allele frequency analysis in association with cephalosporin allergy

The frequency of alleles, and the genotype frequencies of HLA alleles are presented in Table [2](#Tab2). In the group with cephalosporin allergy, three alleles had notably higher genotype frequencies compared to the control group, while the control group had a greater presence of two alleles compared to the cephalosporin allergy group.

We then conducted a univariate logistic regression model adjusted by age and sex. The analysis revealed that HLA-B*55:02 (OR = 1.81, p = 0.015) and HLA-DQB1*06:09 (OR = 2.32, p = 0.002) had a significantly higher likelihood of causing cephalosporin allergy reactions.

To further determine the statistical significance of the connection between HLA alleles and coexisting conditions, we conducted a multiple logistic regression model. The results, presented in Table [3](#Tab3), showed that having HLA-B*55:02 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.18–2.61, p = 0.005), HLA-C*01:02 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.05–1.77, p = 0.018) and HLA-DQB1*06:09 (OR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.62–4.12, p < 0.001) significantly increases the likelihood of developing cephalosporin allergy compared to those without it. Additionally, the presence of autoimmune diseases was found to be a separate risk factor for cephalosporin allergy (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.04–1.89, p = 0.027).

### Correlation between allergy severity and distribution of characteristics and HLA alleles

Patients with cephalosporin-induced allergies were categorized into two groups based on the severity of their condition: mild and severe are shown in Table [4](#Tab4)^11^. The result showed no notable differences in age and gender or other comorbidities such as rhinitis, asthma, dermatitis, urticaria, or autoimmune diseases. To discuss whether the alleles mentioned before in Table [2](#Tab2) will have an impact on the severity of the allergy reaction, we conducted a univariate logistic regression analyzing the relationship between the severity of the allergy reaction and these alleles. As shown in Table [5](#Tab5), no allele showed significant differences between the severe allergy group and the mild allergy group. However, the risk of severe allergy was significantly associated with the HLA-C*01:02 (OR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.12–5.3, p = 0.05) allele genotype. In addition, we conducted a multiple logistic regression model to determine the impact of HLA alleles and comorbidities on the risk of severe cephalosporin-induced allergy. The results showed that HLA-C*01:02 (OR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.05–5.15, p = 0.04) allele had a significant effect on the risk of severe allergy, as shown in Table [6](#Tab6).

## Discussion

In our current investigation, we have established a link between cephalosporin allergy and the HLA-B*55:02, HLA-C*01:02, and HLA-DQB1*06:09 alleles, with the HLA-C*01:02 allele being associated with a higher risk of severe allergy in the Taiwanese population. Furthermore, our study has indicated that a prior history of autoimmune disease is significantly correlated with cephalosporin allergy. These findings could be instrumental in developing tailored approaches to medicine, which could help decrease the incidence of adverse drug reactions in the future.

In our study, Table [3](#Tab3) exhibited a significant association between HLA-B*55:02, HLA-C*01:02, and HLA-DQB1*06:09 alleles and cephalosporin allergy. Previous studies have also found a strong correlation between HLA-B*55:02 and HLA-C*01:02 alleles and methazolamide-induced SJS/TEN in Han Chinese^12,13^. Additionally, the presence of HLA-DQB1*06:09 may serve as a dependable genetic indicator for the development of aspirin-induced urticaria^14^. Although cephalosporin and other drugs have distinct chemical structures, drug allergies can involve various immunological pathways that may be affected by genetic factors, such as differences in drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and immune system genes^15^.

Many studies have investigated the genetic factors associated with beta-lactam antibiotic allergies, but most of them have focused on penicillin-derived drugs. Studies specifically on cephalosporin allergy have often had small sample sizes, making it difficult to reach significance^16,17^. Aside from HLA polymorphisms, candidate gene studies have identified other genetic variations that may play a role in beta-lactam allergy, including genes involved in IgE synthesis, preformed mediators, cytokines and cytokine receptors, and NOD2 genes affecting class II expression^18,19^. Further investigation into these areas is needed to fully understand the genetic basis of these allergies.

In our study, we found that the presence of autoimmune diseases is a distinct risk factor for cephalosporin allergy, as shown as Table [3](#Tab3). Systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma, have a high frequency of drug allergies^20^. T-cell activation and regulatory T cell dysfunction are associated with severe drug eruptions and autoimmune diseases, including SLE and SJS/TEN. Abnormal Treg function can result in an uncontrolled immune response by cytotoxic T cells, causing more severe drug eruptions^21^. Moreover, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases, including SLE and SJS/TEN, and their production and degradation are crucial for maintaining an appropriate balance^22^. These autoimmune diseases, imply that HLA polymorphisms may partially determine the genetic predisposition to these conditions^23^. Our study confirmed the close relationship between cephalosporin allergy and autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to fully comprehend the association between HLA polymorphisms and these conditions.

Regarding the comparability of allele frequencies in our drug-exposed control group with the general population in Taiwan, we have examined data from a study published in 2010. This study involved HLA typing (HLA–A, -B, and -DRB1 alleles) in 46,915 healthy Taiwanese volunteers recruited for the Tzu Chi Taiwan Marrow Donor Registry (TCTMDR)^24^. We compared the allele frequencies from their study with our data and found that the frequencies of alleles with more than 4% prevalence differ by no more than ± 3% between the two datasets. Although the published study includes only HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1, these findings strongly suggest that our data is consistent with the general population in Taiwan. This comparison helps mitigate concerns about spurious associations due to HLA imputation batch effects, demonstrating the reliability of our allele frequency data in the context of the Taiwanese population.

At last, the significant association between the HLA-C*01:02 allele and an increased risk of severe cephalosporin allergy underscores the importance of alerting medical practitioners to the potential risk for allele carriers. This is particularly relevant in Asian populations, where the frequency of the HLA-C*01:02 allele varies widely, ranging from less than 1% to approximately 30%^25^. Using pharmacogenetic screening could be a valuable method to detect individuals who have a higher likelihood of experiencing severe adverse reactions to cephalosporins and avoid possible harm.

Although our study provided valuable insights into the genetic risk factors for cephalosporin allergy in the Taiwanese population, it also had several limitations. The retrospective design of the study and the reliance on reported hypersensitivity reactions in the biobank data may have introduced inaccuracies. Differentiating between immediate and delayed-type drug allergies was not possible due to the absence of information regarding the time interval between drug administration and the onset of symptoms in the electronic medical records. Additionally, the limited number of cases for each drug or drug class of cephalosporins hindered detailed analysis.

Due to the lack of detailed documentation of allergic reaction phenotypes in the EHR, we were unable to distinguish and analyze the association between different types of allergic reaction manifestations (e.g., fixation rash, maculopapular rash, etc.) and HLA molecules. This limits the clinical utility of the results for specific phenotypes. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive data on causal drugs restricts our ability to fully assess if the HLA associations are linked to a single highly prescribed drug, multiple drugs, or an entire class of drugs. Future prospective studies should attempt to collect more detailed clinical phenotypic information.

Despite our efforts to exclude self-reported reactions, the relatively limited sample size necessitated the inclusion of all available data to ensure adequate statistical power. Therefore, future prospective studies with larger cohorts and confirmatory testing are necessary to validate the results. Another limitation is that the study was restricted to the Taiwanese population, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups. Nonetheless, the outcomes of this research may help fill gaps in the global database regarding HLA and adverse drug reactions. Lastly, we did not account for epigenetic factors that can influence gene expression and contribute to phenotypic variation. Future research is needed to explore how epigenetic modifications affect the risk of drug allergies in the Taiwanese population.

Despite these limitations, our study adds to the growing body of literature investigating the genetic basis of cephalosporin allergy in East Asian populations.

## Conclusion

This study revealed a strong correlation between the HLA-B*55:02, HLA-C*01:02, and HLA-DQB1*06:09 alleles and cephalosporin allergy in Taiwan, with the HLA-C*01:02 allele displaying a distinct association with a higher risk of severe allergic reactions. These findings hold significant implications for the advancement of personalized medicine towards mitigating adverse drug reactions.
