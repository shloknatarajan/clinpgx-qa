## Abstract

This cohort study aims to assess the connection between cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 19 (CYP2C19) genotyping, platelet aggregability following oral clopidogrel administration, and the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after off‐pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. From May 2017 to November 2022, a total of 258 patients undergoing elective first‐time CABG surgery, receiving 100 mg/day oral aspirin and 75 mg/day oral clopidogrel postoperatively, was included for analysis. These patients were categorized based on CYP2C19 genotyping. Platelet aggregability was assessed serially using multiple‐electrode aggregometry before CABG, 1 and 5 days after the procedure, and before discharge. The incidences of POAF were compared using the log‐rank test for cumulative risk. CYP2C19 genotyping led to categorization into CYP2C19*1*1 (WT group, n = 123) and CYP2C19*2 or *3 (LOF group, n = 135). Baseline characteristics and operative data showed no significant differences between the two groups. The incidence of POAF after CABG was 42.2% in the LOF group, contrasting with 22.8% in the WT group (hazard risk [HR]: 2.061; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.347, 3.153; p = 0.0013). Adenosine diphosphate‐stimulated platelet aggregation was notably higher in the LOF group compared to the WT group 5 days after CABG (30.4% ± 6.5% vs. 17.9% ± 4.1%, p < 0.001), remaining a similar higher level at hospital discharge (25.6% ± 6.1% vs. 12.2% ± 3.5%, p < 0.001). The presence of CYP2C19 LOF was linked to a higher incidence of POAF and relatively elevated platelet aggregation after CABG surgery under the same oral clopidogrel regimen.

New‐onset POAF is a very common complication after off‐pump CABG. Whether the inter‐individual variation on the incidence rate of POAF was due to genetic polymorphisms for clopidogrel metabolism remained to be known.

The present cohort study demonstrated that the Chinese Han population with the CYP2C19 LOF allele, compared to the WT allele, was associated with a higher incidence of POAF after off‐pump CABG with the same oral dose of clopidogrel.

The patients with CYP2C19 LOF allele on the dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel was associated with high incidence of POAF after off‐pump CABG.

The association between CYP2C19 genotyping and the incidence of POAF is conducive to understanding the pathogenesis of POAF in patients after off‐pump CABG receiving oral clopidogrel and to promoting effective DAPT regimens as prophylaxis for POAF.

## INTRODUCTION

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common cardiac surgery complication, which could jeopardize the recovery of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients and increase the cost burden.[1](#cts13862-bib-0001) It is generally accepted that POAF is a multifactorial phenomenon.[2](#cts13862-bib-0002) Specifically, increased platelet activation is regarded as the prothrombotic state that precipitated POAF.[3](#cts13862-bib-0003) The prophylactic POAF methods have been successfully used in clinical practice, such as remote ischemic preconditioning,[4](#cts13862-bib-0004) which could play a part in reducing platelet activation in coronary artery disease patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).[5](#cts13862-bib-0005)

Early DAPT after CABG has an established place to prevent ischemic events.[6](#cts13862-bib-0006) However, the effective prevention of ischemic events using clopidogrel during the antiplatelet therapy process could be undermined due to low efficacy among the loss‐of‐function (LOF) carriers in the gene cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member19 (CYP2C19).[7](#cts13862-bib-0007) Hence, in clinical practice, it is still necessary to ascertain whether there is a connection between the variability in platelet aggregation resulting from CYP2C19 genotyping and the occurrence of POAF when initiating DAPT including clopidogrel after CABG surgery.

It has been reported that Asian ancestry has a higher percentage of the frequency of carrying the CYP2C19 LOF genotype than its European and African counterparts.[8](#cts13862-bib-0008) The nearly equivalent distribution between the wild‐type (WT) and the LOF groups underscores the significance of conducting CYP2C19 genotyping assessments within the Asian population. This approach aims to establish a correlation between the occurrence of POAF after CABG and CYP2C19 genotype. Thus, this cohort study was conducted to validate the hypothesis that the patients of CYP2C19 LOF presented with high platelet aggregation and a higher incidence rate of POAF after CABG with the same DAPT regimen compared with those of CYP2C19 WT based on CYP2C19 genotyping detection and clinical laboratory science.

## PATIENTS AND METHODS

### Sample size calculation

We assumed a 35% incidence rate of POAF in the total population.[9](#cts13862-bib-0009) According to the sample size calculation equation, at least 90 patients in each group were included to provide a power of 0.8 to detect a 40% reduction in the POAF incidence by any group compared with another group with an incidence ranging from 40% to a two‐sided type I error rate of 0.05. Granting about 35%–50% of the deviation distribution of the WT group in the Chinese Han population, the total number required was 257 patients (calculated with a percentage of 35%). Thus, we determined that the total enrollment number was 264, considering the possible dropout rate of patients at follow‐up about seven cases.

### Patients

The Medical Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital approved the protocol of this comparative cohort study (Approval No. 2017039 on March 1, 2017), and informed consent was obtained from each participant whose clinical data could be published. Adult Chinese Han patients scheduled for elective first‐time off‐pump CABG between May 2017 and November 2022 were screened. Patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation or those taking antiarrhythmic agents other than beta‐blockers,[10](#cts13862-bib-0010) uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, concomitant valvular disease,[11](#cts13862-bib-0011) or ventricular aneurysm, chronic kidney disease,[12](#cts13862-bib-0012) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke,[13](#cts13862-bib-0013) or those who died before the initiation of antiplatelet therapy were excluded. Patients with known thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm^3^), active liver disease (alanine aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of normal), use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin within 12 h for the intervention of platelet aggregation, preoperative bleeding diathesis, or use of proton pump inhibitors with potent inhibitory activity against clopidogrel (omeprazole or esomeprazole) were also excluded.

The primary outcome was the incidence of POAF after the procedure until hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were plasma arachidonic acid (AA)‐induced platelet aggregation at the concentration of 5 mmol/L and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)‐induced platelet aggregation at 3 μmol/L. The medicine expense ratio was calculated as the expense for medicines divided by the total expenses during the hospital stay, which were available and accessible via visiting the first page of medical record. Other postoperative outcomes such as intensive care unit (ICU) stay and hospital stay were also analyzed.

### Surgical procedure and antiplatelet drugs application

A single surgeon sutured all anastomoses via a median sternotomy using the same induction and anesthesia protocol. Preoperative aspirin therapy was continued until the day of surgery. P2Y12 receptor inhibitors were conventionally withdrawn for at least 5 days up to the time of surgery. The same procedure protocol was administered with the left internal mammary artery anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft onto other target vessels.[14](#cts13862-bib-0014) DAPT with standard doses combining 100 mg/day aspirin and 75 mg/day clopidogrel were initiated when postoperative chest tube drainage volume was allowed.

### CYP2C19 genotyping

CYP2C19 genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism technique with abstracted peripheral monocytes. The primer sequences for CYP2C19*2 (681 G>A) were as follows: F: CAGAGCTTGGCATATTGTATC and R: GTAAACACACAACTAGTCAATG. The primer sequences for CYP2C19*3 (636 G>A) were as follows: F: TATGAAGTGTTTTATATCTAATGTTTACTCA and R: ACTTCAGGGCTTGGTCAATATAGA.[15](#cts13862-bib-0015)

### Platelet function testing

Multiple‐electrode aggregometry (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) was performed using whole hirudin anticoagulated blood solution, and changes in electrical impedance were detected when platelets aggregated on the electrodes. To quantify aspirin and clopidogrel's effect, whole blood was stimulated with AA and ADP within the manufacturers' recommended timeframe.[16](#cts13862-bib-0016) Serum samples for platelet reactivity were obtained by venipuncture 1 day before CABG, 1 and 5 days after the procedure, and at discharge from the hospital during the morning hours in a fasting state.

### Postoperative atrial fibrillation

After surgery, patients were routinely transferred from the operating room to the ICU and then to the general surgical ward according to their recovery status. POAF was defined as the occurrence of atrial fibrillation confirmed using electrocardiography (ECG) from surgery until hospital discharge. Continuous ECG telemetry was performed until the fifth postoperative day. Subsequently, 5 days after the procedure and until discharge, ECG monitoring was restored whenever arrhythmia symptoms, such as palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain, and confusion, were present. All symptomatic episodes were followed by synchronized monitoring of the electrocardiogram, which could voluntarily analyze the heart rhythm. The presence of electrocardiographic characteristics of atrial fibrillation, lasting for at least 30 s, was documented as POAF.[17](#cts13862-bib-0017)

### Statistical analysis

The risk factors for POAF were determined using binary logistic regression analysis. For the primary outcome, Kaplan–Meier analysis curves were used to describe the time‐dependent incidence of POAF in both groups, the differences of which were compared with hazard risk using the log‐rank test for cumulative risk. Statistical analysis for secondary outcomes was performed using Student's independent samples *t*‐test for normally distributed continuous variables and the Mann–Whitney *U* non‐parametric test, chi‐square test, or Fisher exact test if *n* ≤ 5 for categorical variables. Continuous variables are reported as median (first quartile, third quartile) or mean ± SD, depending on the normality condition, which was determined using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (percentages). The *p* value and 95% confidence intervals were presented for log‐rank test. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version 25.0; IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences were considered significant at *p* < 0.05. two sides were considered significant.

## RESULTS

Of the 264 subjects meeting the criteria, six patients discontinued oral clopidogrel (severe hemorrhage, three patients in each group) and were excluded. A total of 258 patients were included in the final analysis (Figure [1](#cts13862-fig-0001)). The patients were divided into the WT group of 123 patients (47.7%) and the LOF group of 135 patients (52.3%). The demographic characteristics, disease entities, and comorbidity data for both groups are summarized in Table [1](#cts13862-tbl-0001). No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of graft characteristics and intraoperative transit‐time flowmeters (Table [2](#cts13862-tbl-0002)).

The initiation time of DAPT after CABG was similar in both groups (17.9 ± 5.9 h vs. 17.8 ± 6.4 h, *p* = 0.932). Platelet counts were not statistically different between the WT and LOF groups at each time point. Platelet aggregation increased significantly after the operation compared with the preoperative baseline values in both groups; the following inhibition in AA‐induced platelet aggregation was not significantly different between the two groups, however, the ADP‐stimulated platelet aggregation was notably higher in the LOF group than that in the WT group 5 days after CABG (30.4% ± 6.5% vs. 17.9% ± 4.1%, *p* < 0.001), remaining a similar higher level at hospital discharge (25.6% ± 6.1% vs. 12.2% ± 3.5%, *p* < 0.001, Figure [2](#cts13862-fig-0002)).

The time course of platelet aggregation after off‐pump CABG. Platelet count and platelet aggregation (PA) response against arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were measured before (T0) and 1 day (T1), 5 days (T2) after off‐pump CABG and before discharge from the hospital (T3). Other abbreviations are as in Figure 1. The lower and upper borders of the box represent the lower and upper quartiles (25th percentile and 75th percentile). The middle horizontal line represents the median. The lower and upper whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values of non‐outliers. Extra dots represent outliers.

The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that only CYP2C19 genotyping was statistically significant associated with POAF (*p* < 0.001). Overall, POAF occurred in 57 of 135 patients (42.2%) in the LOF group versus 28 of 123 patients (22.8%) in the WT group (hazard risk [HR]: 2.061; 95% CI: 1.347–3.153; *p* = 0.0013, Figure [3](#cts13862-fig-0003)). Among them, ECG monitoring was performed in 16 patients from day 5 after the procedure to the hospital discharge; seven occurrence events were deemed POAF after checking the historical records. All patients with new‐onset POAF received an intravenous infusion of amiodarone, while two received electrical cardioversion due to hemodynamic instability. The successful conversion rates of POAF before the hospital discharge were 96% (27/28) and 96% (55/57) in the WT and LOF groups, respectively. The postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the WT group than in the LOF group (9.9 ± 1.7 days vs. 10.5 ± 1.7 days, *p* = 0.005, Figure [4](#cts13862-fig-0004)). The percentage of medicine expense in the total expense was lower in the WT group than that in the LOF group (25.9% ± 2.7% vs. 28.2% ± 3.1%, *p* < 0.001, Table [3](#cts13862-tbl-0003)).

## DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to associate CYP2C19 genotyping with the incidence of POAF after off‐pump CABG. The present study sheds light on the association between CYP2C19 LOF carriers and a higher incidence of POAF after off‐pump CABG based on the platelet aggregation response to ADP.

New‐onset POAF is a very common complication after CABG, with a rate of around 20%–40%, and its pathogenesis is complex.[18](#cts13862-bib-0018) Prophylactic measures like reducing the inflammatory reaction with ischemic preconditioning[19](#cts13862-bib-0019) and surgical drainage of pericardial effusion[20](#cts13862-bib-0020) take some effect. Another therapeutic strategy is blocking the adrenergic signaling pathway by calcium‐induced ganglionated plexi injury.[9](#cts13862-bib-0009) Platelet reactivity was also thought to be linked to POAF after CABG based on temporal development evidence in previous studies. POAF mainly occurred within the entire first postoperative week and peaked on postoperative day 2.[21](#cts13862-bib-0021) The patients developing POAF were also associated with increased platelet activation despite on‐aspirin treatment after CABG.[22](#cts13862-bib-0022) The platelet reactivity was elevated in the first week after the procedure and higher in off‐pump CABG patients than in on‐pump CABG patients.[23](#cts13862-bib-0023)

Platelet reactivity assays have been practiced in clinical laboratory science from bench to bed. Antiplatelet therapy is widely accepted as a fundamental component of pharmacotherapy for coronary artery disease. Mounting evidence from observational studies indicates that high platelet reactivity to ADP is linked to ischemic event occurrence after percutaneous coronary intervention.[24](#cts13862-bib-0024) It is equally important to initiate DAPT following CABG as secondary prevention of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events. Platelet reactivity monitoring was also successfully applied to precisely predict the discontinuation of DAPT instead of a traditional fixed timeframe to shorten the waiting time for CABG and reduce perioperative bleeding and medical expenses.[25](#cts13862-bib-0025) In animal studies, the usual and loading dose of clopidogrel to induce protection against ischemic events varies between 2 days and 4 h.[26](#cts13862-bib-0026) Initiating a DAPT protocol immediately after off‐pump CABG within 6 h of surgery as the solution was suggested by Shennib et al.[27](#cts13862-bib-0027) Given the complication of re‐exploration for bleeding, we adapted the moderate regimen that preoperatively discontinued clopidogrel >5 days up to the time of surgery[28](#cts13862-bib-0028) and the administration of the DAPT regimen when postoperative chest tube drainage was ≤30 mL/h for 2 h.[29](#cts13862-bib-0029)

Clopidogrel is a commonly prescribed P2Y_12_ inhibitor. The pharmacodynamic effect of clopidogrel varies because the hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 that activates the prodrug is modified by gene polymorphisms. The CYP2C19*1 allele was cataloged as the WT type, and the other two common CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles were defined as the LOF type owing to their low antiplatelet efficacy. The population carrying any CYP2C19 LOF allele was considered to have an increased risk of new‐onset stroke events in patients receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin following a minor ischemic attack.[30](#cts13862-bib-0030) Therefore, CYP2C19 testing in clinical practice may be of particularly high value in the Chinese Han population, who has a high probability of carrying nonfunctional alleles. The present cohort study also showed that platelet aggregation was lower in genotype CYP2C19 *1 than in genotypes *2 or *3, which coincided with a lower cumulative risk of POAF. A significantly higher risk of POAF incidence was observed in CYP2C19 LOF carriers following CABG in the first week, which overlapped with the timeframe of a significant increase in platelet reactivity.

Inter‐individual variation in the incidence of POAF after CABG was linked to genetic polymorphisms in previous studies, such as the G protein‐coupled kinase five gene, which is related to the adrenergic signaling pathway.[31](#cts13862-bib-0031) Our study is the first to associate POAF with the functional pharmacogenomics of clopidogrel in clinical practice, and the clinical significance lies in modifying the immobilized DAPT to adapt to the disparities of drug metabolism for the sake of preventing POAF. Subjects suffering from POAF with inefficient DAPT could be avoided or optimized to decrease the by‐effects, such as prolonged hospital stay and medical expense costs. Therefore, CYP2C19 genotyping and quantitative inhibiting efficacy of antiplatelet drugs should be considered as a biomarker to predict POAF in patients undergoing CABG procedures for public medical resources.[32](#cts13862-bib-0032) The reduction of POAF after CABG might be achieved using a regimen of perioperative prophylaxis including pharmacogenomic detection in combination with platelet function tests, particularly with prompt initiation of effective antiplatelet therapy, as well as complementary antiarrhythmic therapies. The present study also sheds light on the pathogenesis of POAF after CABG from the viewpoints of pharmacogenomics and clinical laboratory science. The dichotomy in CYP2C19 genotyping not only identified clopidogrel resistance but also predicted a higher incidence of POAF. Genetic polymorphisms responsible for weaker metabolic activation played a role in the increased incidence of POAF when the oral antiplatelet drug clopidogrel was administered. In the future, pharmacometabonomic phenotype‐guided personalized DAPT should be considered as prophylaxis for POAF in patients undergoing off‐pump CABG.

Ticagrelor, another P2Y_12_ inhibitor, does not require metabolic activation. A large randomized trial in the Chinese Han population demonstrated that patients with CYP2C19 LOF alleles with acute non‐disabling cerebrovascular events taking oral clopidogrel had a higher stroke rate than those taking non‐targeting ticagrelor.[33](#cts13862-bib-0033) Due to the limitation of complications such as increasing bleeding risk in patients over 80 years,[34](#cts13862-bib-0034) risk‐effectiveness of switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor and platelet aggregation‐guided medication regimen is warranted in future higher‐quality rating studies after detecting metabolizer status.[35](#cts13862-bib-0035)

### Study limitations

Firstly, this was not a randomized study but a cohort study of well‐matched grouping according to genotyping definition. Another genotype, CYP2C19*17, was not analyzed in our clinical practice because it is less frequent in East Asian populations.[36](#cts13862-bib-0036) Although there was a low probability of new‐onset POAF after day 5, the limitation on the method adopting symptoms‐induced assessment after day 5 could underestimate the accidence of POAF.
