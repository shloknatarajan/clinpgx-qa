## Abstract

**Purpose:** 
UGT1A1*28/*6 as predictors of severe irinotecan-related diarrhea (SIRD) were duplicated by many studies. However, some patients of lower risk genotype (UGT1A1*1/*1) still suffered SIRD and the extremely low frequency of UGT1A1*6/*6 limited its clinical usage. Previous studies proved that the transforming growth factor (TGFB) family may have some effect on MTX-induced mucositis. However, the associations between TGFB gene variants and SIRD have never been reported so far. Our aim was to improve the predictive value of UGT1A1 gene variants on SIRD.

**Methods:** 
Six SNPs (TGFB1 rs1800469; TGFBR1 rs10733710, rs334354 and rs6478974; TGFBR2 rs3087465; UGT1A1*6) and UGT1A1*28 were selected for genotyping in 160 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with irinotecan in a prospective multicenter trial (NCT01282658).

**Results:** 
UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, rs1800469 and rs3087465 were all associated with SIRD (p = 0.026, 0.014, 0.047 and 0.045 respectively). A novel genetic score model (with a cut off value of 1.5) based on them was created to predict SIRD (OR = 11.718; 95 % CI 2.489–55.157, p = 0.002). In patients of gene score > 1.5, the risk of SIRD was much higher (23.5 vs. 2.8 %, p = 2.24E−04) and continued in the first 6 cycles of chemotherapy, while in patients with gene score ≤1.5, the risk was much lower and none of them suffered SIRD after the first cycle of chemotherapy (p = 0.0003).

**Conclusions:** 
The novel genetic score model improved the predictive value of UGT1A1 on SIRD. If validated, it will provide valuable information for clinical use of irinotecan.

### Purpose

*UGT1A1**28/*6 as predictors of severe irinotecan-related diarrhea (SIRD) were duplicated by many studies. However, some patients of lower risk genotype (*UGT1A1**1/*1) still suffered SIRD and the extremely low frequency of *UGT1A1**6/*6 limited its clinical usage. Previous studies proved that the transforming growth factor (TGFB) family may have some effect on MTX-induced mucositis. However, the associations between *TGFB* gene variants and SIRD have never been reported so far. Our aim was to improve the predictive value of *UGT1A1* gene variants on SIRD.

### Methods

Six SNPs (*TGFB1* rs1800469; *TGFBR1* rs10733710, rs334354 and rs6478974; *TGFBR2* rs3087465; *UGT1A1**6) and *UGT1A1**28 were selected for genotyping in 160 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with irinotecan in a prospective multicenter trial ([NCT01282658](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01282658)).

### Results

UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, rs1800469 and rs3087465 were all associated with SIRD (*p* = 0.026, 0.014, 0.047 and 0.045 respectively). A novel genetic score model (with a cut off value of 1.5) based on them was created to predict SIRD (OR = 11.718; 95 % CI 2.489–55.157, *p* = 0.002). In patients of gene score > 1.5, the risk of SIRD was much higher (23.5 vs. 2.8 %, *p* = 2.24E−04) and continued in the first 6 cycles of chemotherapy, while in patients with gene score ≤1.5, the risk was much lower and none of them suffered SIRD after the first cycle of chemotherapy (*p* = 0.0003).

### Conclusions

The novel genetic score model improved the predictive value of *UGT1A1* on SIRD. If validated, it will provide valuable information for clinical use of irinotecan.

## Novelty and impact

Only *UGT1A1**28/*6 (compared with *1) were duplicated by many studies to predict severe irinotecan-related diarrhea (SIRD) till now. However, some *UGT1A1**1/*1 patients still have SIRD and the extremely low frequency of *UGT1A1**6/*6 genotype limited its clinical usage. We found that *TGFB1/TGFBR2* gene variants improved the predictive value of *UGT1A1**28/*6 and could further predict SIRD in *UGT1A1 *1/*1* patients. We further created a novel genetic score model to predict SIRD (OR = 11.718, *p* = 0.002).

## Introduction

Irinotecan has been widely used for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, intestinal damage and severe diarrhea are serious side effects of irinotecan and constrain its usage. The precise mechanism behind the diarrhea has not been established till now.

Irinotecan is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to form its active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin(SN-38). Irinotecan and SN-38 bind to topoisomerase I–DNA complex producing double bond damage and premature cell death. Inactivation and detoxification of SN-38 occurs primarily through UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)-catalyzed glucuronidation (Kawato et al. [1991](#CR14)). UGT1A1 plays an important role in irinotecan-induced diarrhea. Mice with deletion of the *Ugt1a1* gene were developing severe and lethal mucositis at much lower CPT-11 doses (Chen et al. [2013](#CR4)). In humans, *UGT1A1**28/*28 (TA7/7) or UGT1A1*28/*1 (TA7/6) genotype was found to be associated with an increased risk of severe irinotecan-related diarrhea (SIRD, grade ≥3) when using irinotecan doses ≥125 mg/m^2^ (Hu et al. [2010](#CR10)). Homozygous (not heterozygous) variants of *UGT1A1**6 showed a notable risk of SIRD too (Cheng et al. [2014](#CR5)). *UGT1A1* was the only gene marker advised by the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the heightened risk of serious side effects of irinotecan till now (Liu et al. [2008](#CR19)). Prediction of severe diarrhea holds the key to the effective use of irinotecan. This will in turn ensure the safety of patients and also improve their quality of life. However, *UGT1A1* gene variants could only partly figure out the patients with higher risk of SIRD. There is still some room for improvement (1) some of the *UGT1A1**1/*1 (TA6/6) genotype patients will have SIRD; (2) the reported frequency of *UGT1A1**6/*6 genotype was located from 1.1 to 4.2 % in Asians (Jada et al. [2007](#CR12); Tsunedomi et al. [2014](#CR29); Yang et al. [2015](#CR30)). It was even much lower in Iranians (0.3 %) (Shakibi et al. [2014](#CR27)), African-Americans (0.0 %) (Innocenti et al. [2009](#CR11)) and Saudi Arabians (0.0 %) (Alkharfy et al. [2013](#CR2)). The extremely low frequency of *UGT1A1**6/*6 genotype limited its clinical usage in predicting SIRD. We need to explore new markers to improve the predictive value of *UGT1A1* gene variants.

Animal models of irinotecan-induced mucositis are used to identify the basic mechanisms in diarrhea pathogenesis. Upregulation of many inflammatory and immune-related mediators are observed in this process, such as PGE2, NF-κB, oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-33, IL-8, IL-18, COX-2, accompanied by loss of crypt architecture and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (Kase et al. [1997](#CR13); Melo et al. [2008](#CR21); Guabiraba et al. [2014](#CR9); Lee et al. [2014](#CR17)).

The transforming growth factor (TGFB) family plays key regulatory functions in a diverse spectrum of biological processes, including inflammatory and immune responses and may have effects on chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. The TGFB containing diet has a beneficial effect in an animal model of intestinal inflammation (Schiffrin et al. [2005](#CR25)) and a rat model of MTX-induced mucositis. Dietary TGFB supplementation reverses intestinal damage, causes anti-inflammatory effects and stimulates intestinal recovery (Ben-Lulu et al. [2012](#CR3)). However, the association between TGFB and SIRD has never been reported till now. In the present study, we investigated the associations between *TGFB1/TGFBR1/TGFBR2/UGT1A1* gene variants and SIRD in mCRC patients.

## Materials and methods

### Study design and patient eligibility

Study patients were from a prospective multicenter cohort study which was registered on [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) with the reference number [NCT01282658](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01282658) and began in November 2010. Six cancer centers in Hubei province were involved (Table S1). The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before recruitment.

Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colorectum; measurable disease, defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; no expected course of radiotherapy during the first-line chemotherapy; no previous irinotecan exposure; Karnofsky’s index of performance status ≥60 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale ≤2; not pregnant or nursing; voluntarily signed the informed consent; total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 times ULN (≤5 times ULN if liver metastases present); creatinine clearance >50 ml/min or serum creatinine ≤1.5 times ULN. Details of exclusion criteria were shown in supplementary, including chronic diarrhea history; pelvic radiotherapy in the past 1 year and so on.

The primary objectives were to assess the correlation between *TGFB1/TGFBR1/TGFBR2* in combination with *UGT1A1**6/*28 gene variants and SIRD in Chinese mCRC patients.

### Toxicity assessment

Patients usually stayed in hospital for chemotherapy. Toxicity information was collected by face-to-face questionnaires and was graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria of Adverse Events version 4.0 at every cycle. SIRD was defined as (1) Grade ≥3 diarrhea came out during or after chemotherapy, (2) exclude infection or other organic intestinal disease, (3) investigators thought that the diarrhea was related to irinotecan. Evaluations were performed blinded to the genetic results and were assessed independently by two doctors. A third doctor resolved inconsistencies. The clinical data were monitored by the study sponsor. A single cycle of chemotherapy was considered enough to evaluate grade ≥3 diarrhea; otherwise, at least 3 cycles (6 weeks) of chemotherapy would be needed in the diarrhea assessment analysis.

### Baseline variables

Baseline clinical information was collected prior to the commencement of chemotherapy, including demographics, smoking and alcohol consumption status, KPS, tumor-related details, and medical history (such as history of allergic diseases, diabetes, hypertension, etc.). Smoking and alcohol consumption status was coded as 0 = never and 1 = ever or current.

### Polymorphism selection and genotyping

We searched the National Center for Biotechnology Information SNP database (dbSNP; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)). Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped based on the following criteria: (a) minor allele frequency greater than 0.1 in the Chinese population; (b) polymorphism that could alter the function of the gene [either published data or predicted function by using [http://compbio.cs.queensu.ca/F-SNP](http://compbio.cs.queensu.ca/F-SNP) or [http://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/cgi-bin/snpinfo/snpfunc.cgi](http://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/cgi-bin/snpinfo/snpfunc.cgi)]. Six SNPs (*TGFB1* rs1800469; *TGFBR1* rs10733710, rs334354 and rs6478974; *TGFBR2* rs3087465; *UGT1A1**6 rs4148323) combined with UGT1A1*28 (rs8175347) were selected for genotyping.

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood (stored at −80 °C until use) by using the QIAGEN DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MassArray (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) was employed to analyze genotypes of 6 SNPs using allele-specific MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Primers and multiplex reactions were designed using Assay Designer software 3.1. The TA index of the *UGT1A1* promoter (*UGT1A1**28; rs8175347) was genotyped by fragment sizing, described in Supplementary Genotyping Methods. Primers were designed by Primer Premier 5, sequencing by ABI 3730, and results were analyzed by GeneMapper ID v3.2. Five percent of the samples were randomly selected and genotyped by direct sequencing, with a resulting concordance rate of 100 %.

### Statistical analysis

Correlation between dichotomous outcome (grade ≥3 diarrhea) and every variant was tested using the Pearson Chi-squared test. Gene variants with a *p* value <0.1 were included in the multivariable logistic regression model (enter) and adjusted for potential confounding factors (sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, family history of any type of cancers and the history of allergic diseases, diabetes and hypertension was as dichotomous variables; age and performance status were as continuous variables). Odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated as estimates of the correlations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to compare the models with and without positive TGFB gene variants. Time to SIRD (TTD) survival curves by cycle was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Multivariate analyses, adjusted for important clinical variables, were done using the Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard ratios (HR) and their 95 % CI were calculated as estimates of the correlations. A value of *p* < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in a two-tailed test. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the *χ* ^2^ test, and *p* < 0.05 indicated a deviation from equilibrium. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Survival curves were drawn by Graphpad Prism 6.

## Results

### Patient characteristics and treatment outcome

The patients’ characteristics are presented in Table [1](#Tab1). From November 2010 to December 2014, 164 patients were recruited to collect clinical information and somatic DNA. Four patients without diarrhea information; hence, 160 patients were available for analysis. A total of 24 patients (15 %, 24/160) had SIRD. It was comparable to previously reported data of V308 study (Tournigand et al. [2004](#CR28)). Diarrhea of grade 1 and 2 occurred in 38 (23.8 %) and 27 (16.9 %) patients, respectively (Table S2).

### Information of studied gene variants

The information and genotype frequency of studied gene variants are reported in Tables [2](#Tab2) and S3. The minor allele frequencies (MAF) of studied variants were mostly comparable to previously reported data from the 1000 Genomes Project, except for rs4148323, rs334354 and rs3087465. However, the MAF of rs4148323, was comparable to that reported in Chinese (Li et al. [2014](#CR18)). For rs334354, the MAF were higher, while for rs3087465, the MAF was lower in our population. All variants were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

### Correlation between studied genotypes and SIRD

Among the 160 patients who were considered suitable for diarrhea evaluation, we performed 955 chemotherapy cycles in total, with a median of 6, and a range of 1–12. The complete set of associations between each gene variant and grade ≥3 diarrhea is shown in Table S4. UGT1A1*28 (TA6/7 and TA7/7), rs4148323 (AA) and rs1800469 (AG/GG) were associated with a higher risk of grade ≥3 diarrhea (25 vs. 11.2 %, *p* = 0.029, 50.0 vs. 13.5 %, *p* = 0.041 and 19.1 vs. 6.0 %, *p* = 0.032, respectively) by Chi-squared test. The multivariable logistic regression model (enter) included the genetic factors with *p* < 0.1 in Chi-squared analysis and the potential confounding factors. Results are presented in Table [3](#Tab3). rs4148323, UGT1A1*28, rs1800469 and rs3087465 were all associated with grade ≥3 diarrhea after adjusting for sex, age, history of allergies, diabetes and hypertension, smoking status, alcohol consumption and family history of cancer (*p* = 0.026, 0.014, 0.047 and 0.045, OR = 15.368, 3.939, 4.391 and 3.694, 95 % CI 1.385–170.495, 1.316–11.794, 1.020–18.905 and 1.027–13.289 respectively).

### Correlation between genetic score model and SIRD

To assess the contribution of the multivariable logistic regression model to prediction of SIRD, ROC analysis was performed using UGT1A1 gene score (calculated as rs4148323 × 2.732 + UGT1A1*28 × 1.371) and UGT1A1+TGFB gene score (calculated as rs4148323 × 2.732 + UGT1A1*28 × 1.371 + rs1800469 × 1.480 + rs3087465 × 1.307). We set rs4148323 (AA), UGT1A1*28 (67/77), rs1800469 (AG/GG), and rs3087465 (GG) as 1, and details are presented in Table [3](#Tab3). UGT1A1+TGFB gene score gave higher AUC value (0.762 vs. 0.661, *p* < 0.001; Fig. [1](#Fig1)) than UGT1A1 gene score in ROC analysis. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the gene score was an independent predictor of SIRD (Table [4](#Tab4), OR = 11.718; 95 % CI 2.489–55.157, *p* = 0.002). We set the cut off value of UGT1A1+TGFB gene score as 1.5. In patients with gene score >1.5, the risk of SIRD was much higher (Fig. [2](#Fig2)a, 23.5 vs. 2.8 %, *p* = 2.24E−04) and the risk curve of SIRD goes to a platform after the 6th cycle, demonstrating that the risk continued in the first 6 cycles of chemotherapy, while in those patients whose gene score was ≤1.5, the risk of SIRD was much lower and the risk curve of SIRD goes to a platform after the first cycle of chemotherapy, it means no more patients suffered SIRD since the second cycle (Fig. [2](#Fig2)b, *p* = 0.0003). A Cox multivariate analysis was done to estimate the HR of TTD for different UGT1A1+TGFB gene score. Results suggested that UGT1A1+TGFB gene score >1.5 was also the independent risk predictor of TTD, after adjustment for sex, age, history of allergies, diabetes and hypertension, smoking status, alcohol consumption and family history of cancer (Table S5, HR = 9.358; 95 % CI 2.112–41.456, *p* = 0.003).

### Subgroup analysis of TGFB gene variants and diarrhea in UGT1A1*1/*1 (TA6/6) patients

In the present study, 13 in 116 (11.2 %) patients with *UGT1A1**1/*1 genotype still experienced SIRD. We further analyzed the predictive value of the two positive TGFB gene variants in *UGT1A1**1/*1 patients. A value of *p* < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in a one-side test. Results are presented in Tables [5](#Tab5) and S6. We found that A allele of rs3087465 can predict severe diarrhea of those patients in both univariate [Fisher’s exact test, one side, 15.2 % (12 of 79) vs. 2.7 % (1 of 37), *p* = 0.039 (one side), Table S6] and multivariate analysis (OR = 9.253; 95 % CI 1.102–77.668, *p* = 0.040, adjustment for sex, age, history of allergies, diabetes and hypertension, smoking status, alcohol consumption and family history of cancer, Table [5](#Tab5)). G allele of rs1800469 had predictive trends of severe diarrhea in multivariate analysis (*p* = 0.070, Table [5](#Tab5)).

## Discussion

We found that rs1800469 of TGFB1 and rs3087465 of TGFBR2 improved the predictive value of UGT1A1 gene variants on SIRD. The gene score obtained by the calculation of *UGT1A1* (rs4148323, *UGT1A1**28) and *TGFB* (rs1800469, rs3087465) variants was an independent predictor of severe diarrhea in mCRC patients treated by irinotecan. UGT1A1+TGFB gene score had much higher sensitivity than UGT1A1 gene score alone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to create a gene score model from TGFB pathway and *UGT1A1* gene variants to predict SIRD. It is also the first study to evaluate the effect of TGFB pathway gene variants on SIRD in *UGT1A1**1/*1 patients based on a prospective multicenter study cohort.

In our study, the incidence of irinotecan- induced diarrhea was comparable to previously reported data and the predictive value of *UGT1A1**28 and *UGT1A1**6 (rs4148323) on SIRD was repeated (Hu et al. [2010](#CR10); Cheng et al. [2014](#CR5)). Hence, the reliability of our data was acceptable.

Irinotecan causes diarrhea by inducing apoptosis and hypoproliferation in both the small and large intestines, and causes colonic damage with changes in goblet cells and mucin secretion (Gibson et al. [2003](#CR8)), loss of proliferative cell and inflammation in the intestinal tract (Chen et al. [2013](#CR4)).

TGFB may play a complicated role in chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Researchers reported that CXCL9 can exacerbate chemotherapeutic agent-induced intestinal damage via promoting the secretion of TGFB (Lu et al. [2015](#CR20)). The mucosal protective agent rebamipide attenuated the 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis and reduced the expression of TGFB1 (Kim et al. [2015](#CR15)). That is to say TGFB1 may increase the risk of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. However, transgenic mice that express a truncated TGFBR2 have an impaired ability to resolve colitic inflammation as demonstrated by increased lethality, granulocytic inflammation, and delayed goblet cell regeneration (Rani et al. [2011](#CR24)). Dietary TGFB2 supplementation decreased apoptosis, increased cell proliferation in jejunum and ileum and reduced methotrexate-induced intestinal mucosal injury (Ben-Lulu et al. [2012](#CR3)). Administration of TGFB2 did not increase serum level of TGFB2 (de Koning et al. [2007](#CR6)). It implies that unlike TGFB1, TGFB2/TGFBR2 may play a protective role in the process of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.

The promoter area SNP of *TGFB1*: rs1800469 (A to G) was in tight linkage with rs1800470, which was proved to be involved in splicing regulation (Lee and Shatkay [2008](#CR16)). rs1800469 G allele has also been found to be associated with increased secretion of TGFB1 and hence the higher circulating levels of mature protein (Dunning et al. [2003](#CR7); Shah et al. [2006](#CR26)). In our study, we confirmed that the *TGFB1*:rs1800469 G allele carriers had higher risk of SIRD.

rs3087465 (A to G), a SNP in *TGFBR2*, is located in the promoter region of *TGFB2* which encodes *TGFBR2*. TGFBR2 forms a heterodimeric complex with TGFBR1 and binds TGFB ligands. In turn, this mediates a variety of physiological and pathological processes: cell cycle arrest, control of mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation, wound healing, extracellular matrix production, immunosuppression, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, as well as carcinogenesis and metastasis (Achyut and Yang [2011](#CR1); Principe et al. [2014](#CR23)). A highly significant association between the A allele of *TGFBR2*: rs3087465 and a decreased risk of gastric cancer in Asian ancestry was confirmed in a meta-analysis with high level evidence and low false-positive report probability (Mocellin et al. [2015](#CR22)). However, the association between *TGFBR2*:rs3087465 variant and chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucosal injury was unclear. In our study, we found that the *TGFBR2*: rs3087465 A allele carriers had lower risk of irinotecan-related severe diarrhea. The underlying mechanism needs to be studied later.

In addition, we calculated UGT1A1+TGFB gene score and analyzed its predictive value on severe diarrhea. Compared to patients with gene score ≤1.5, patients with UGT1A1+TGFB gene score >1.5 had much higher risk of SIRD and significantly shorter TTD. In patients with *UGT1A1**1/*1 genotype, *TGFB* gene variants may further figure out those who with higher risk of SIRD. That is to say *TGFB* gene variants improve the sensitivity of *UGT1A1**28/*6 in predicting irinotecan associated severe diarrhea.

Our study has its potential limitations. First, the enrolled patients are mostly from southern China, geographical origin may bring bias in genotype frequency analysis. Second, the multiple comparisons performed increase the possibility of detecting false-positive associations. Finally, we lack a replication study and samples are from cohort study.

Since most of the methods correcting for multiple testing are very conservative, based on previous findings, we had a prior hypothesis for each gene variant chosen, which may reduce the need for correction. We used multivariate analysis (enter) which includes all the possible covariates to verify the results of univariate analysis. We also did our best and designed the study prospectively with multicenter to reduce Bias. Nevertheless, these results should be considered with caution until replicated in another population study.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that rs1800469 of *TGFB1* and rs3087465 of *TGFBR2* are significantly associated with SIRD in Chinese mCRC patients. We found that *TGFB1/TGFBR2* gene variants improved the predictive value of *UGT1A1**28/*6 and could further predict SIRD in *UGT1A1**1/*1 patients. The genetic score model of *UGT1A1**28, *UGT1A1**6, *TGFB1*: rs1800469 and *TGFBR2*: rs3087465 can predict SIRD better than *UGT1A1* variants alone. It may provide useful information for personalized chemotherapy of mCRC patients. Further studies might be carried out to reveal the mechanism behind TGFB pathway and SIRD, as well as the role of TGFB in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-related diarrhea.
