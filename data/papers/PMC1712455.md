## Abstract

A single base change in the RYR1 gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (calcium-sensitive calcium-release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum), resulting in the substitution of G1021 by A, has been proposed to underlie malignant-hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility in as many as 10% of cases in the European population. As part of our mutation-screening program in MH-susceptible (MHS) individuals, we have investigated this substitution in individuals from 151 unrelated British MHS families and have detected G1021A heterozygotes in 7 families. This mutation was not found in 156 unrelated MH-negative (MHN) individuals. We also examined eight families with central core disease (CCD): the mutation did not occur in any family members of any disease status (affected or unaffected for CCD, MHS, or MHN). In one large family, the G1021A mutation was found but did not show complete cosegregation with MH susceptibility: it occurred in only 7/12 MHS individuals in the kinship, and susceptibility was inherited from parents who were G1021 homozygotes, as well as from parents who were heterozygotes. On the basis of these findings, it is clearly unreliable at present to offer presymptomatic DNA testing for MH status, even in families in which a mutation has been detected.
