## Abstract

Higher rifampicin doses may improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes. This could however exacerbate the existing drug interaction with dolutegravir. Moreover, the metabolism of dolutegravir may also be affected by polymorphism of UGT1A1, a gene that codes for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase. We used population pharmacokinetic modeling to compare the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir when coadministered with standard- versus high-dose rifampicin in adults with tuberculosis and HIV, and investigated the effect of genetic polymorphisms. Data from the SAEFRIF trial, where participants were randomized to receive first-line tuberculosis treatment with either standard- 10 mg/kg or high-dose 35 mg/kg rifampicin alongside antiretroviral therapy, were used. The dolutegravir model was developed with 211 plasma concentrations from 44 participants. The median (interquartile range) rifampicin area under the curve (AUC) in the standard- and high-dose arms were 32.3 (28.7–36.7) and 153 (138−175) mg·h/L, respectively. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination and absorption through transit compartments best described dolutegravir pharmacokinetics. For a typical 56 kg participant, we estimated a clearance, absorption rate constant, and volume of distribution of 1.87 L/h, 1.42 h−1, and 12.4 L, respectively. Each 10 mg·h/L increase in the AUC of coadministered rifampicin from 32.3 mg·h/L led to a 2.3 (3.1–1.4) % decrease in dolutegravir bioavailability. Genetic polymorphism of UGT1A1 did not significantly affect dolutegravir pharmacokinetics. Simulations of trough dolutegravir concentrations show that the 50 mg twice-daily regimen attains both the primary and secondary therapeutic targets of 0.064 and 0.3 mg/L, respectively, regardless of the dose of coadministered rifampicin, unlike the once-daily regimen.

## INTRODUCTION

Thanks to its superior efficacy, safety, and high genetic barrier to resistance ([1](#B1) [–](#B2) [3](#B3)), dolutegravir-based combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) was rolled out as first-line treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection ([4](#B4)). Dolutegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, mainly metabolized by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), but also a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein ([5](#B5), [6](#B6)). *UGT1A1*, the gene that codes for UGT, is polymorphic ([7](#B7), [8](#B8)) and increase in the number of TA_n_ repeats in its promoter region from TA_6_ (*UGT1A1*1*) to TA_7_ (*UGT1A1*28*) results in reduced activity ([9](#B9)). This has been associated with increased dolutegravir exposure ([10](#B10)) and higher incidence of neuropsychiatric adverse events ([11](#B11)).

Rifampicin is a key first-line drug for drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) ([12](#B12)), a common comorbidity among people with HIV ([13](#B13)). Early initiation and coadministration of ART during TB treatment are recommended, and their efficacy and tolerability are important ([4](#B4)). Increasing the daily rifampicin dose from 10 to 35 mg/kg has been investigated as a potential component of strategies to shorten TB treatment duration ([14](#B14) [–](#B15) [18](#B18)) and improve efficacy ([15](#B15), [19](#B19), [20](#B20)).

Rifampicin, though, is an inducer of CYP3A4, UGT, P-glycoprotein ([21](#B21), [22](#B22)), and significantly lowers dolutegravir’s exposure ([1](#B1)). Consequently, the dose of dolutegravir must be doubled from 50 mg once-daily (OD) to twice-daily (BID) ([23](#B23), [24](#B24)) when coadministered with rifampicin. Currently, the protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC_90_) of HIV-1 (0.064 mg/L) is considered the primary therapeutic target of dolutegravir trough concentration (C_trough_) ([1](#B1), [5](#B5)). The geometric mean C_trough_ of the least efficacious dose in the SPRING-1 trial ([25](#B25), [26](#B26)) of 0.3 mg/L has also been adopted as a secondary target.

Non-compartmental analysis of data from the Safety/tolerability, And EFficacy of high-dose RIFampicin (SAEFRIF) trial ([27](#B27)) showed a decrease in dolutegravir C_trough_ of participants who received 35 mg/kg compared to those on standard-dose of rifampicin ([17](#B17)). Using population pharmacokinetic modeling, we investigated the effect of high-dose rifampicin and *UGT1A1* polymorphism on dolutegravir pharmacokinetics. We also performed simulations to predict target attainment in a large cohort of *in silico* individuals using different dosing strategies.

## RESULTS

### Study participants

Of 111 participants in the pharmacokinetic phase of the SAEFRIF study ([17](#B17)), 58 (52%) were randomized to the dolutegravir arm. Of these, 14 (5 on 10RHZE and 9 on 35RHZE) were not included in the pharmacokinetic analysis because they were considered non-adherent to medication. Their exclusion did not significantly change participant characteristics as shown by [Table S1](#SuF1) in the supplement materials.

A total of 211 dolutegravir plasma concentrations from 44 (76%) participants were used to develop the pharmacokinetics model: 28 (64%) were male and 19 (43%) received 35RHZE. Their median (inter-quartile range, IQR) weight and age were 56 (47-61) kg and 36 (28–40) years, respectively ([Table 1](#T1)). Rifampicin pharmacokinetic data were analyzed separately ([28](#B28)), and the median (IQR) rifampicin AUC_0-24_ for the standard- and high-dose cohorts were 32.3 (28.7–36.7) and 153 (134–175) mg·h/L, respectively. Of note, the high-dose exposures were lower than previously reported and this was attributed to lower relative bioavailability of the top-up rifampicin-only formulation used together with the RHZE fixed-dose combination (FDC). Using the model to adjust for this effect and predict exposures, assuming full bioequivalence of the two formulations, the median rifampicin AUC_0-24_ (IQR) was 230 (160-334) mg·h/L.

### UGT genotypes

Of the 44 participants included in the dolutegravir pharmacokinetic analysis, 9 (20%) were not genotyped because of failed DNA amplification. Results were, therefore, available for 35 individuals: 3 (7%) were heterozygous for *UGT1A1*36* (TA)_5_, 19 (43%) were homozygous for *UGT1A1*1* (TA)_6_, 11 (25%) were heterozygous for *UGT1A1*28* (TA)_7_, and 2 (5%) were homozygous for *UGT1A1*28* (TA)_7_ ([Table 1](#T1)).

### Dolutegravir pharmacokinetic model

Dolutegravir pharmacokinetics was adequately characterized by a one-compartment model with first-order elimination and absorption through a series of transit compartments (objective function value [ΔOFV] = −6.5, 1 degree of freedom [df], *P* = 0.011 compared to lag). A second compartment did not improve the model fit and neither did the well-stirred liver model. Clearance and volume were best allometrically scaled ([29](#B29)) by fat-free mass (FFM, ΔOFV = −3.96) and normalized to the median FFM of 43 kg. A 1.56-fold scaling factor on the between occasion variability (BOV) of absorption parameters was added to account for the uncertainty in dosing information (ΔOFV = −5.2, 1 df, *P* = 0.023).

When investigating the effect of high-dose rifampicin by comparing study arms, participants on 35RHZE were found to have 31% decreased dolutegravir bioavailability (ΔOFV = −6.9, 1 df, *P* = 0.009) compared to those on 10RHZE. When the effect was tested on clearance, a 17% increase was detected but the model fit was worse (ΔOFV = −4.02, 1 df, *P* = 0.046). A model including both effects was not better than having the effect on bioavailability alone (ΔOFV = −0.40, 1 df, *P* = 0.527) ([Table S2](#SuF1)).

Alternatively, we tested the rifampicin effect on dolutegravir bioavailability as a continuous covariate using the individual values of rifampicin area under the curve (AUC_0-24_). This produced better improvement in the model fit (ΔOFV = −12.1, one df, *P* < 0.001) and predicted that, for each 10 mg·h/L increase in AUC_0-24_ of rifampicin from the median 10RHZE AUC_0-24_ (32.3 mg·h/L), dolutegravir bioavailability would reduce by 2.3 (3.1–1.4) %. This continuous effect of rifampicin AUC_0-24_ on dolutegravir bioavailability is presented in [Fig. 1](#F1) and was preferred in the final model as it may provide an opportunity to predict the magnitude of the interaction within therapeutic exposures of rifampicin.

A function of dolutegravir bioavailability versus 24 hours AUC0-24 of coadministered rifampicin. Fi =TVF+RIFF⋅(RIFAUCi−32.310) . The dotted (red) and dashed (blue) vertical lines represent the median AUC0-24 of the standard- and observed high-dose arms of the study. The dash-dot (purple) vertical line is the median AUC0-24 of the predicted high-dose cohort assuming bioequivalence of the two rifampicin formulations (top-up rifampicin-only formulation and fixed dose combination). The shaded areas represent the 50th and 90th confidence intervals of the predicated dolutegravir bioavailability.

*UGT1A1* genotype effects were neither statistically significant on dolutegravir clearance nor bioavailability when tested separately. *UGT1A1*28* was associated with a nonsignificant 6% increase in bioavailability (ΔOFV = −0.394, 2 df, *P* = 0.821), resulting in similar dolutegravir exposures.

The visual predictive check (VPC) ([Fig. 2](#F2)) shows that the final model adequately described the data as median, 5th and 95th percentiles all fell within their respective model predicted 95% CI. The estimated typical values of clearance and volume of dolutegravir were 1.87 L/kg and 12.4 L, respectively ([Table 2](#T2)). The terminal half-life of dolutegravir was estimated to be 4.41 and 4.49 hours in the 10RHZE and 35RHZE arms, respectively. The geometric mean (IQR) of the model-derived dolutegravir AUC_0-12_, and C_trough_ for participants in the 10RHZE arm were 21.6 (18.8–24.2) mg·h/L and 1.07 (0.866–1.47) mg/L, respectively. These values decreased to 15.2 (13.6–16.0) mg·h/L and 0.744 (0.527–1.00) mg/L in the 35RHZE arm.

### Simulations

Results of the simulations, displayed in [Fig. 3](#F3), show predicted dolutegravir C_trough_ after different dosing strategies. With the 50 mg BID dolutegravir regimen, everyone (99% in 35RHZE arm) attained the PA-IC_90_ and 0.3 mg/L. The proportion who attained 0.3 mg/L reduced to 92% when higher 35RHZE exposures were given. When dolutegravir 50 mg OD with rifampicin was administered, 92% and 18% of simulated population in the 10RHZE arm attained the PA-IC_90_ and 0.3 mg/L targets, respectively. These proportions reduced to 83% and 8%, respectively, in the 35RHZE cohort. When the higher 35RHZE rifampicin exposure was tested, only 65% and 2% attained PA-IC_90_ and 0.3 mg/L target, respectively.

The shaded region (0.269–3.19) mg/L represents the 95% prediction interval of trough concentrations achieved in participants with HIV taking dolutegravir 50 mg once daily without rifampicin (30).

## DISCUSSION

We developed a population pharmacokinetic model to describe the effect of standard- versus high-dose rifampicin on dolutegravir pharmacokinetics in adults with TB and HIV, and performed simulations to demonstrate how different doses of rifampicin affect exposure across different weight bands. We found that rifampicin coadministration lowers dolutegravir bioavailability but doubling its dose to 50 mg BID is sufficient to maintain exposures above therapeutic targets, even when high-dose rifampicin exposures were higher than what we observed. We could not find an effect of *UGT1A1* gene polymorphism on dolutegravir pharmacokinetics.

We found that increasing rifampicin exposure affects dolutegravir bioavailability and that this relationship was best described in our data using a linear function ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Each 10 mg·h/L increase in the AUC_0-24_ of coadministered rifampicin decreased dolutegravir bioavailability by 2.3%, corresponding to a 31% decrease between the typical patient on 10RHZE and 35RHZE in our study. When trying to extrapolate what this reduction would be at rifampicin concentrations reported in other studies of high-dose rifampicin (AUC of 230 mg·h/L), the reduction was 45%. Because of the direct relationship between bioavailability and AUC ([31](#B31)), rifampicin coadministration is predicted to similarly effect dolutegravir AUC. This finding is consistent with the fact that rifampicin is an inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes ([21](#B21)) and previous findings that rifampicin coadministration lowers dolutegravir exposure ([23](#B23), [24](#B24), [32](#B32)).

To contextualize our results and compare them with previous studies, we summarized them and previous findings in [Table 3](#T3). As previously reported, dolutegravir AUC_0-24_ of the 10RHZE arm was lower than that achieved with 50 mg OD in absence of rifampicin ([25](#B25)) and comparable to previous reports where dolutegravir was coadministered BID with rifampicin ([24](#B24)). A further reduction in dolutegravir AUC_0-24_ was observed in the high-dose rifampicin cohort. This was attributed to reduced bioavailability of dolutegravir and not increased clearance, and this is evident in terminal elimination phase of the VPC. This is an interesting observation that may be due to maximal induction of hepatic enzyme activity that has been reported at standard doses of rifampicin ([33](#B33), [34](#B34)). Possibly, maximal induction may not have been achieved in the gut with standard doses, and higher rifampicin doses resulted in additional induction of gut enzymes and/or transport proteins causing more pre-systematic elimination of dolutegravir ([1](#B1), [6](#B6), [21](#B21)).

As consensus builds about the most appropriate clinical dolutegravir therapeutic target, the 50 mg BID dose maintained C_trough_ above the higher 0.3 mg/L target, irrespective of rifampicin dose in the coadministered anti-TB regimen. Conversely, the 50 mg OD dose was predicted to achieve C_trough_ generally lower than 0.3 mg/L but mostly above the PA-IC_90_ of 0.064 mg/L, at least when rifampicin is coadministered at 10 mg/kg. Consistent with this, recent findings in Botswana showed that participants who took the once-daily dolutegravir 50 mg dose with a standard dose rifampicin-containing anti-TB regimen achieved similar viral suppression to those whose dolutegravir dose was doubled ([36](#B36)). This seems to point towards the validity of the lower target. Moreover, dolutegravir has a long dissociative half-life from viral integrase of about 71 hours ([3](#B3)), which may provide protection against drug concentrations temporarily falling below the PA-IC_90_. Taking all this into perspective, it seems plausible that the efficacy of dolutegravir could be maintained at lower concentrations than currently targeted, and this question deserves further investigation.

A one-compartment model adequately described dolutegravir pharmacokinetics, like that reported by Zhang et al. ([25](#B25)), Barcelo et al. ([30](#B30)), and Parant et al. ([37](#B37)). This, however, deviates from the two-compartment model that was reported by Kawuma et al. ([38](#B38)) and Dickinson et al. ([39](#B39)). This divergence in structural model may be due to differences in study design and sampling schedule, since in the latter studies all participants were sampled over 24 hours after dose whereas those in our study were sampled over 8 hours. Dolutegravir clearance in the 10RHZE cohort was more than twice as high as that reported in studies of dolutegravir alone (average of 0.92 L/kg) ([24](#B24), [25](#B25), [30](#B30), [38](#B38)). This level of induction is in line with findings from other studies where the drug was coadministered with standard doses of rifampicin ([24](#B24), [30](#B30), [32](#B32)).

Dolutegravir exposure during rifampicin cotreatment was also found to be similar in participants with or without the less functional *UGT1A1*28* allele, deviating from previous reports without rifampicin where differences were observed ([11](#B11)). This may be due to our limited sample size or that in the presence of the strong enzyme inducer like rifampicin, genotype is no longer a meaningful influencer of dolutegravir exposure. Interestingly, *UGT1A1*1* was the most prevalent allele in our study population, in contrast with previous findings reporting *UGT1A1*28* as the most common allele in the Ugandan population ([40](#B40)).

Our study had limitations. We used a parallel design because the intensive phase of TB treatment, during which we conducted the study, could not allow enough time for steady-state induction to be achieved between one rifampicin dose and the other. We did not include participants taking dolutegravir without rifampicin but try to remedy this by comparing our results with previous studies where dolutegravir was given alone. The rifampicin plasma concentrations observed in the 35RHZE arm were unexpectedly lower ([28](#B28)), but we explored what would happen at higher rifampicin exposures using model-based simulations. Whereas the relationship between rifampicin exposure and dolutegravir bioavailability may be saturable like many physiologic reactions, we use a linear function that represents a worst-case scenario and demonstrate that dolutegravir exposures would be okay regardless. Finally, the sample size of our study was limited, and it may not have been large enough for us to draw conclusions about the effect of genetic polymorphism on dolutegravir pharmacokinetics.

In conclusion, increasing the rifampicin dose in the anti-TB regimen from the current 10 to 35 mg/kg reduces the bioavailability of concomitant dolutegravir. However, despite further reduction in dolutegravir exposure due to a higher rifampicin dose, doubling the dolutegravir dose to 50 mg BID maintains its C_trough_ above therapeutic targets.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Study design

SAEFRIF was a clinical trial conducted at the Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. Pharmacokinetic data were collected from enrolled participants with TB and HIV who received efavirenz- or dolutegravir-based ART ([27](#B27)). The protocol was approved by a local research and ethics committee, registered at clinicaltrials.gov ([NCT03982277](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03982277)), and all participants provided written informed consent.

A detailed description of the design and inclusion/exclusion criteria of SAEFRIF has been reported ([17](#B17), [27](#B27)). Newly diagnosed adults with TB and HIV were randomized to either receive 10 mg/kg (10RHZE) or 35 mg/kg (35RHZE) rifampicin dose-containing regimen in the intensive phase of TB treatment. ART-naïve participants were randomly assigned to start either dolutegravir- or efavirenz-based ART, 2 weeks into TB treatment, while those already on ART continued with their existing medications. The TB treatment consisted of RHZE programmatic Macleods (Macleods, India) FDC and top up Rifacos (Cosmos, Kenya) rifampicin-only capsules in the 35RHZE arm ([28](#B28)). The dolutegravir dose was doubled to 50 mg BID during and up to 2 weeks after completion of TB treatment. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant, had rifampicin-resistant TB, or impaired liver/renal function.

### Specimen collection and processing

Pharmacokinetic sampling was done after at least 4 weeks of ART. An observed dose of ART and anti-TB medication was given, and blood samples drawn at pre-dose, then 1-, 2-, 4- and 8 hour postdose. The samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection, and plasma stored at −80°C until bioanalysis.

Dolutegravir plasma concentrations were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using a previously published method ([41](#B41)), with modifications. The assay was calibrated over a range of 0.05 (lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) to 10 mg/L with inter- and intra-day precision of 8.2% to 10.9% CV and 1.9% to 7.5% CV, respectively. Quality control samples were prepared and stored at concentrations of 0.06, 0.6, and 6 mg/L, and based on their analysis, the bias (% relative error) ranged from 1.0% to 10.0%.

DNA was extracted from the participant’s blood samples, using QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. DNA quantification and quality control were done using the NanoDrop 2000c (ThermoScientific). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the *UGT1A1* gene was performed using primer sets. The success of the amplification was determined, and following confirmation of amplification, the amplicons were cleaned for Sanger sequencing using ExoSAP-IT (Applied Biosystems). Cycle sequencing chain termination PCR was then set up with the forward primer. The cycle sequencing products were then cleaned up and sequenced. The variants were called from the Sanger traces using a mutation surveyor.

### Pharmacokinetic analysis

Population pharmacokinetic modeling of dolutegravir plasma concentrations was performed using NONMEM software (v7.5.0) ([42](#B42)). Perl-speaks-NONMEM (v5.2.6) was used to execute various model development and evaluation methods ([43](#B43)). Pirana (v3.0.0) was used to track model development and Xpose4, together with RStudio (v1.4.1106), used to perform model diagnostics and post-modeling analysis ([43](#B43)).

Several structural models were tested to describe the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir; one- and two-compartment models with first-order elimination and absorption with or without lag time or a chain of transit compartments ([44](#B44)). We also tested elimination using a well stirred liver model ([45](#B45), [46](#B46)). Log normally distributed between-occasion (each dose) variability was tested on absorption parameters, whereas between-subject variability was tested on disposition parameters ([47](#B47)). A combined proportional and additive error was used to model residual unexplained variability ([48](#B48)), with lower bound of the additive component fixed to 20% of the LLOQ (0.05 mg/L). Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 mg/L) were imputed to LLOQ/2, except for consecutive values during the elimination phase which were excluded from the fit as described in Beal’s M6 method ([49](#B49), [50](#B50)).

Allometric scaling by total body weight or FFM ([29](#B29), [51](#B51)) was applied to account for body size effects on disposition parameters, with exponents on clearance and volume fixed to 0.75 and 1, respectively ([52](#B52)). To investigate the effect of the dose of coadministered rifampicin, two different approaches were tested. First, the effect was tested categorically (i.e., 10RHZE vs 35RHZE) and then continuously using rifampicin 24 hours area under the concentration curve (AUC_0-24_) determined separately ([28](#B28)). Other covariates like *UGT1A1* genotype and age were also investigated. Model development was guided by evaluation of change in minimum value of objective function and inspection of diagnostics plots like the VPC. The changes (Δ) in OFV were assumed to follow a chi-square distribution whereby, for hierarchical models, a ΔOFV of at least 3.84 points was considered significant at *P* < 0.05 for 1 df. Sampling importance resampling procedure was used to assess parameter uncertainty and generate 95% CI ([53](#B53)). The final model was used to estimate participants’ steady-state dolutegravir AUC_0-12_ for comparison with previous reports.

### Simulations

We used the final dolutegravir model estimates to perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate proportions of individuals who would attain treatment targets. The targets used were a C_trough_ above the PA-IC_90_ and 0.3 mg/L ([5](#B5), [26](#B26)). A suitable data set was generated using demographic characteristics of 1,225 participants with TB from pharmacokinetic studies carried out in West Africa and South Africa as described previously ([54](#B54)). The different dosing scenarios simulated were: dolutegravir 50 mg OD or BID, with standard- or high-dose rifampicin containing TB regimen. With our model, we also explored a scenario of higher rifampicin exposures in the 35RHZE. Data will be made publicly available upon publication and upon request for peer review.
