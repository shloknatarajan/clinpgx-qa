## Abstract

**Purpose:** 
Wilms tumor gene single nucleotide polymorphism (WT1 SNP) rs16754 has been described as a favorable risk marker in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Subsequent studies revealed inconsistent results in both adult and pediatric patients. We analyzed its impact on clinical outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for the first time.

**Methods:** 
WT1 SNP rs16754 of 158 children with ALL treated according to ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster treatment trials from 1990 to 2009 and 43 hematopoietic stem cell donors was analyzed by allelic discrimination. WT1 SNP status was correlated with disease characteristics and clinical outcome comparing SNP (WT1GG/AG) and wildtype (WT1AA).

**Results:** 
At least one minor allele was found in 23.4 % of patients and 34.9 % of donors (P = 0.07). Distribution of patient and disease characteristics was similar between WT1GG/AG and WT1AA. In multivariate analyses, WT1 SNP was an independent good prognostic marker for cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR WT1AA vs. WT1GG/AG HR = 3.384, P = 0.021) and event-free survival (EFS; event risk WT1AA vs. WT1GG/AG HR = 2.503, P = 0.036). Univariate subanalyses of patients who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation revealed more significant differences in CIR (P = 0.017), EFS (P = 0.012), and overall survival (OS; P = 0.017). Donor’s WT1 SNP status did not affect outcome. We found no correlation between WT1 SNP and WT1 expression level at diagnosis (P = 0.634).

**Conclusion:** 
WT1 SNP rs16754 predicts improved CIR and EFS. Outcome differences were more prominent in transplanted children. Our findings identify WT1 SNP rs16754 as a favorable risk marker in pediatric ALL which is independent from known risk factors.

### Purpose

Wilms tumor gene single nucleotide polymorphism (WT1 SNP) rs16754 has been described as a favorable risk marker in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Subsequent studies revealed inconsistent results in both adult and pediatric patients. We analyzed its impact on clinical outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for the first time.

### Methods

WT1 SNP rs16754 of 158 children with ALL treated according to ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster treatment trials from 1990 to 2009 and 43 hematopoietic stem cell donors was analyzed by allelic discrimination. WT1 SNP status was correlated with disease characteristics and clinical outcome comparing SNP (WT1^GG/AG^) and wildtype (WT1^AA^).

### Results

At least one minor allele was found in 23.4 % of patients and 34.9 % of donors (*P* = 0.07). Distribution of patient and disease characteristics was similar between WT1^GG/AG^ and WT1^AA^. In multivariate analyses, WT1 SNP was an independent good prognostic marker for cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR WT1^AA^ vs. WT1^GG/AG^ HR = 3.384, *P* = 0.021) and event-free survival (EFS; event risk WT1^AA^ vs. WT1^GG/AG^ HR = 2.503, *P* = 0.036). Univariate subanalyses of patients who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation revealed more significant differences in CIR (*P* = 0.017), EFS (*P* = 0.012), and overall survival (OS; *P* = 0.017). Donor’s WT1 SNP status did not affect outcome. We found no correlation between WT1 SNP and WT1 expression level at diagnosis (*P* = 0.634).

### Conclusion

WT1 SNP rs16754 predicts improved CIR and EFS. Outcome differences were more prominent in transplanted children. Our findings identify WT1 SNP rs16754 as a favorable risk marker in pediatric ALL which is independent from known risk factors.

## Introduction

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in childhood. In the past three decades, survival probability increased from 77 % (Moricke et al. [2010](#CR18)) up to 90 % (Conter et al. [2010](#CR5)). Clinical, laboratory, and molecular risk factors have been investigated to perform risk-adapted therapy in order to improve outcome and to reduce acute and late treatment-related toxicity. Damm et al. ([2010](#CR6)) described a favorable outcome of adult patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carrying the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16754 in Wilms tumor gene (WT1). Subsequent studies revealed conflicting results in both adult and pediatric AML (Choi et al. [2012](#CR4); Ho et al. [2011](#CR11); Hollink et al. [2010](#CR13); Luna et al. [2012](#CR16)). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that WT1 SNP rs16754 has a favorable prognostic impact in pediatric ALL.

WT1, located on chromosome 11p13, was first isolated in 1990. It contains ten exons which encode an amino-terminal proline-/glutamine-rich transcription-regulating region and 4 C-terminal DNA-binding zinc-finger domains (Call et al. [1990](#CR3); Haber et al. [1991](#CR9)). WT1 expression is naturally restricted to a few tissues such as the developing kidney and CD34+ cells, whereas expression in adult kidney is limited to podocytes and decreases in mature hematopoietic cells (reviewed by (Yang et al. [2007](#CR24)). WT1 was initially discovered as tumor suppressor gene in nephroblastoma which is also known as Wilms tumor. However, subsequent findings suggest a potential oncogenic role in human cancers such as colorectal (Oji et al. [2003](#CR19)), breast (Loeb et al. [2001](#CR15)), and brain tumors (Oji et al. [2004](#CR20)) as well as leukemia (Menssen et al. [1995](#CR17)). High levels of WT1 expression in leukemia (Ho et al. [2011](#CR11)), growth inhibition of leukemic cells by WT1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (Yamagami et al. [1996](#CR22)), and induction of G_2_/M arrest of leukemic cells by suppressing WT1 expression (Yamagami et al. [1998](#CR23)) implicate an involvement of WT1 in leukemogenesis. The gene’s dual behavior as transcription repressor or activator as well as its role as a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene seems to depend on the tissue context, presence or absence of regulatory partners (e.g., p53), and the gene product’s isoform which is caused by alternative splices (Yang et al. [2007](#CR24)).

In WT1 SNP rs16754, guanine replaces adenine. Since this substitution (CGA > CGG) does not cause an amino acid exchange (arginine), it is called a silent SNP (Ho et al. [2011](#CR11)).

## Methods

### Patients

We analyzed diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 158 children (age 1–17 years) with ALL who had been diagnosed between 1990 and 2011. Patients had been entered into the treatment trials ALL-BFM 90, 95, 2000 (Moricke et al. [2010](#CR18)), and 2009. The median follow-up for patients alive was 8.47 years (range 2.18–19.76 years). DNA samples of 43 stem cell donors were available.

### SNP analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from cryopreserved blasts or mononuclear cells using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). DNA concentration was measured photometrically. WT1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 10 ng DNA. A total of 40 PCR cycles was performed using the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min, 92 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed using the TaqMan^®^ SNP Genotyping Assay (Assay-ID C__12034416_10) for WT1 SNP rs16754. 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR-System was provided by Applied Biosystems (Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany).

### Expression analysis

RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for RNA isolation following the manufacturer’s recommendations. We used 0.5 µg RNA and random hexamers for cDNA synthesis with Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen). PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). We applied 1 µl of cDNA and determined the WT1 levels in comparison to expression level of ß2-microglobulin which was used as a housekeeping gene to evaluate aberrant RNA degradation. Both expression levels were measured in a standard curve created with K562 cells. We arbitrarily set expression levels in 1 µl of K562 cDNA as reference 1.

### Statistical analysis

Due to the low number of patients carrying genotype WT1^GG^ (*n* = 4), we compared a combined group of WT1^GG/AG^–WT1^AA^. Baseline characteristics were investigated using Fisher’s exact test for categorical and the Mann–Whitney *U* test for continuous variables. To estimate the distribution of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), Kaplan–Meier method was used. We used log-rank test to evaluate differences between survival curves for EFS and OS. For cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), we performed the Gray test. CIR was defined as the time from diagnosis to relapse. EFS was defined as the time from diagnosis to the date of relapse or death. In case of no remission, the date of diagnosis was used as the date of the event. OS was defined as time from diagnosis to death. Patients without events were censored from the time of loss of follow-up. For subanalyses of transplanted patients, the observation period started at the date of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard model to adjust for potential confounding variables. Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, United States) and R 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with a significance level of *P* < 0.05.

## Results

### Prevalence of WT1 SNP rs16754

WT1 SNP rs16754 was found in 33 patients (20.9 %) and was homozygous (WT1^GG^) in 4 (2.5 %) and heterozygous (WT1^AG^) in 29 (18.4 %) patients. Paired samples from diagnosis and remission were available in eight patients (2 WT1^GG^, 4 WT1^AG^, 2 WT1^AA^). Here, WT1 SNP status was not changed. Fifteen (34.9 %) of 43 hematopoietic stem cell donors carried at least one minor SNP allele which was homozygous in 3 (7 %) and heterozygous in 12 (27.9 %) donors. We found a trend toward a higher prevalence of WT1 SNP rs16754 in healthy donors compared to patients with ALL (*P* = 0.07).

### Patient characteristics

Baseline characteristics were compared between patients carrying at least one minor SNP allele and patients with WT1 wildtype. There were no significant differences in clinical, laboratory, and molecular variables. Risk group stratification was based on biological criteria such as immunophenotype, chromosomal aberrations such as hypodiploidy and translocation t(4;11), and treatment response (prednisone response day 8, complete remission day 33, and findings in minimal residual disease). WT1 SNP rs16754 distribution did not differ significantly between risk groups (Table [1](#Tab1)).

### Prognostic impact of WT1 SNP rs16754

Patients with and without WT1 SNP rs16754 showed significant differences in CIR (15.2 vs. 37.6 %, *P* = 0.021), EFS (78.8 vs. 57.6 %, *P* = 0.028), and OS (87.9 vs. 67.2 %, *P* = 0.018) (Fig. [1](#Fig1)). All four patients carrying genotype WT1^GG^ are alive, well, and without relapse. Analyses based on risk group stratification (HR, IR, SR) did not reveal significant differences in CIR, OS, and EFS (data not shown).

### Prognostic factors and multivariate analyses

To evaluate whether WT1 SNP rs16754 status is an independent prognostic factor for CIR, EFS, and OS, we performed multivariate analyses. Patients with genotype WT1^GG/AG^ had significantly less relapse events (*P* = 0.021). In comparison with well-known risk factors such as age, sex, prednisone response, initial white blood cell count, and immunophenotype, WT1 SNP rs16754 status turned out to be an even stronger independent prognostic factor for EFS than established risk factors (*P* = 0.036). For OS, there was only a trend toward better OS in patients carrying WT1 SNP rs16754 (*P* = 0.074, Table [2](#Tab2)).

### Prognostic impact of WT1 SNP rs16754 in allogeneic HSCT

Nine (27.3 %) of 33 children carrying genotype WT1^GG/AG^ underwent an allogeneic HSCT, whereas 44 (35.2 %) of 125 patients carrying genotype WT1^AA^ received an allogeneic HSCT (*P* = 0.534). Within the subgroup of 53 transplanted children, we found that 100 % of the patients carrying at least one minor SNP allele (WT1^GG/AG^) were transplanted in complete remission, while only 76.6 % of the patients carrying genotype WT1^AA^ achieved complete remission before transplantation (*P* = 0.178). None of the WT1^GG/AG^ patients (*n* = 9) suffered from relapse after transplantation (Fig. [2](#Fig2)a), whereas 19 (43.2 %) of the WT1^AA^ patients (*n* = 44) relapsed (*P* = 0.019). Moreover, patients carrying at least one minor SNP allele had a better EFS (WT1^GG/AG^ 88.9 vs. WT1^AA^ 38.6 %*, P* = 0.009) and OS (WT1^GG/AG^ 88.9 % vs. WT1^AA^ 40.9 %*, P* = 0.011). In multivariate analysis, wildtype carriers had a 7.5 times higher event risk (*P* = 0.055) and a 7 times higher risk to die (*P* = 0.062). Survival curves differed significantly as shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2). In our cohort, WT1 SNP rs16754 status of hematopoietic stem cell donors did not have an impact on CIR (*P* = 0.152), EFS (*P* = 0.116), and OS (*P* = 0.203).

### WT1 SNP rs16754 and WT1 expression

WT1 expression level was analyzed in 47 patients (7 WT1^GG/AG^, 40 WT1^AA^). Median expression did not differ significantly between WT1^GG/AG^ and WT1^AA^ (0.052 vs. 0.074, *P* = 0.634). WT1 SNP rs16754 had no effect on WT1 expression at diagnosis (*P* = 0.634, Fig. [3](#Fig3)). We found that low WT1 expression level at diagnosis is correlated with better CIR compared to high WT1 expression level (4.3 vs. 25 %, *P* = 0.046). There was no significant correlation between WT1 expression level at diagnosis and EFS (*P* = 0.137) or OS (*P* = 0.097).

## Discussion

The impact of WT1 SNP rs16754 on clinical outcome in patients with AML has been investigated in several adult and pediatric cohorts and revealed inconsistent results. Since ALL is the most common malignancy in childhood, we examined the impact of the WT1 SNP in pediatric patients with ALL and found a significant correlation between WT1 SNP rs16754 and a better clinical outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first study on WT1 SNP rs16754 in a pediatric ALL cohort.

At least one minor SNP allele (WT1^GG/AG^) was found in 20.9 % of the patients with ALL and in 34.9 % of the 43 hematopoietic stem cell donors, which is in accordance with the frequency expected in a normal population as reported by Damm et al. ([2010](#CR6)). Different allele distribution between patients and healthy volunteers indicates a potentially decreased susceptibility of SNP carriers to ALL (RR = 0.84). Larger observations are needed to prove whether WT1 SNP rs16754 status influences the susceptibility to ALL as it has been reported in the context of other polymorphisms (Dunna et al. [2014](#CR7); Zhang et al. [2014](#CR25)).

We found no change in SNP status when we compared leukemic cells and cells in complete remission. These observations confirm the findings reported by Damm et al. ([2010](#CR6)) that WT1 SNP rs16754 is a constitutive variant in humans and is not a particular acquired mutation in leukemic cells.

In this study, we identified WT1 SNP rs16754 as an independent prognostic marker for decreased CIR (relapse risk WT1^AA^ vs. WT1^GG/AG^ HR = 3.384) and better EFS (event risk WT1^AA^ vs. WT1^GG/AG^ HR = 2.503) in pediatric ALL. We found a significantly better OS in patients carrying genotype WT1^GG/AG^ in univariate analysis (*P* = 0.031). The favorable effect on CIR, EFS, and OS was more pronounced in the group of patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT. This could be explained by the fact that WT1 SNP carriers were in complete remission more often than wildtype patients at the time of allogeneic HSCT (100 vs. 76.7 %, *P* = 0.178). Subanalyses of patients who were transplanted in complete remission revealed no significant differences in outcome between WT1^GG/AG^ and WT1^AA^ (data not shown). Therefore, WT1 SNP rs16754 causes a discrepancy before transplantation starts. Among others this could be due to a better drug sensitivity. Unfortunately, too few patients were homozygous for the SNP (WT1^GG^). Thus, we could not consider its particular impact on clinical outcome. Other authors reported conflicting results on WT1 SNP rs16754. This could be due to differences in allele distributions in different ethnicities, since WT1^GG^ is characterized as wildtype allele in Asian patients (Choi et al. [2012](#CR4)). Therefore, some authors compared a group of WT1^GG^ to a group of WT1^AG/AA^ patients. Since we investigated Caucasian people in this study, we compared a group of WT1^GG/AG^ to a group of WT1^AA^ patients which is similar to the design used by Damm et al. ([2010](#CR6)).

Mechanisms of how WT1 SNP rs16754 alters gene function and leads to a superior outcome are not yet discovered in detail. As a first consideration, correlation analyses were performed for WT1 SNP status and WT1 RNA expression level at diagnosis. In this study, WT1 RNA expression levels were similar between patients with (median 0.052, range 0.000–0.560) and without WT1 SNP rs16754 (median 0.074, range 0.000–1.443, *P* = 0.634). These findings are in accordance with the data reported in pediatric and adult AML patients by Hollink et al. ([2010](#CR13)) and Damm et al. ([2010](#CR6)). Our results are in contrast to the findings by Ho et al. ([2011](#CR11)) who described a correlation between WT1 SNP rs16754 and higher WT1 RNA expression level in pediatric patients with AML.

Furthermore, we found no correlation between WT1 RNA expression level and EFS or OS in this study. There was a lower risk of relapse in patients with low WT1 expression. Other authors reported conflicting results indicating a worse outcome in case of abnormal increased or decreased expression level (Boublikova et al. [2006](#CR1); Heesch et al. [2010](#CR10); Spanaki et al. [2007](#CR21)). For pediatric ALL, Boublikova et al. ([2006](#CR1)) described a correlation between an abnormal increase or decrease in WT1 RNA expression and a higher risk of relapse. In 2014, Ho et al. ([2014](#CR12)) published that there was no difference in WT1 SNP rs16754 distribution regarding WT1 expression level in pediatric patients with AML. Nevertheless, they showed that WT1 SNP rs16754 wildtype patients with high WT1 expression had significant poor OS and EFS. These discrepancies in study results may be caused by the highly variable expression levels depending on the studied age groups or leukemia subtypes. It has been reported that WT1 RNA expression levels are much higher in older (adult) patients and much lower in B-lineage ALL compared to T-lineage ALL and in ALL compared to AML (Boublikova et al.

Other mechanisms of altering gene function possibly may affect RNA binding and stability, alternative splicing, or protein folding and may lead to altered drug sensitivity. In addition, WT1 SNP status may be associated with SNPs or mutations of other genes and may affect drug metabolism.

Finally, we suggest that WT1 SNP rs16754 could be used as a new prognostic marker for risk stratification in pediatric ALL that is independent from known risk factors (Table [1](#Tab1)). A possible limitation of our study is the long observation period which included four different ALL-BFM treatment protocols. However, WT1 SNP rs16754 was equally distributed between these protocols. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the above results and to elucidate the mechanisms that cause the SNP’s effect on clinical outcome.
