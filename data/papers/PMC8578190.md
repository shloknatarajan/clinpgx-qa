## Abstract

**Objective:** 
In AIDS Clinical Trials Group study A5338, concomitant rifampicin, isoniazid, and efavirenz was associated with more rapid plasma medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) clearance compared to historical controls without tuberculosis or HIV therapy. We characterized the pharmacogenetics of this interaction.

**Methods:** 
In A5338, women receiving efavirenz-based HIV therapy and rifampicin plus isoniazid for tuberculosis underwent pharmacokinetic evaluations over 12 weeks following a 150-mg intramuscular injection of depot MPA. Data was interpreted with nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Associations between individual pharmacokinetic parameters and polymorphisms relevant to rifampicin, isoniazid, efavirenz, and MPA were assessed.

**Results:** 
Of 62 A5338 participants in four African countries, 44 were evaluable for pharmacokinetic associations, with 17 CYP2B6 normal, 21 intermediate, and 6 poor metabolizers, and 5 NAT2 rapid, 20 intermediate, and 19 slow acetylators. There were no associations between either CYP2B6 or NAT2 genotype and MPA Cmin at week 12, apparent clearance, Cmax, AUC0–12wk or half-life, or unexplained interindividual variability in clearance, and uptake rate constant or mean transit time of the slow-release fraction (p>0.05 for each). In exploratory analyses, none of 28 polymorphisms in 14 genes were consistently associated with MPA pharmacokinetic parameters, and none withstood correction for multiple testing.

**Conclusions:** 
Study A5338 suggested that more frequent depot MPA dosing may be appropriate for women receiving rifampicin, isoniazid, and efavirenz. The present results suggest that knowledge of CYP2B6 metabolizer or NAT2 acetylator status does not inform individualized DMPA dosing in this setting.

## Introduction

Tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are leading causes of infection-related deaths worldwide [[1](#R1)]. Women comprise more than half of the estimated 37 million persons living with HIV and are disproportionately affected by new infections among individuals over 15 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa [[2](#R2)]. Coinfection with *M. tuberculosis* and HIV in pregnancy markedly increases risk of maternal and child morbidity and mortality [[3](#R3)–[5](#R5)], thus access to effective contraception is critical. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is an intermediate-acting progesterone-only injectable contraceptive commonly used globally, including in sub-Saharan Africa because of its efficacy and convenience of administration [[6](#R6)]. Following a 150-mg intramuscular dose of DMPA, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) concentrations exceed the therapeutic target (0.1 ng/mL) for approximately 12 weeks and inhibit ovulation for up to 14 weeks [[7](#R7)]. The probability of ovulation increases when MPA concentrations fall below 0.1 ng/mL [[8](#R8), [9](#R9)]. MPA undergoes metabolism by hepatic CYP isoforms, primarily CYP3A4 [[10](#R10)].

Rifampicin and isoniazid are cornerstone drugs for treating drug-sensitive tuberculosis, while efavirenz is recommended for women of childbearing potential as an alternative to dolutegravir as component of first-line antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa [[11](#R11)]. Rifampicin, isoniazid, and efavirenz are often used concomitantly in sub-Saharan Africa in patients living with HIV and tuberculosis. Rifampicin and efavirenz are potent inducers of cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes that metabolize MPA [[10](#R10), [12](#R12)], and have been shown to reduce concentrations and compromise efficacy of some hormonal contraceptives [[13](#R13), [14](#R14)]. This raised concern that concomitant rifampicin and efavirenz would increase risk for contraceptive failure with DMPA, as compared to DMPA without such drug-drug interactions.

Study A5338 ([NCT02412436](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02412436)) of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) was a 12-week, phase II, open-label, single-arm study of steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions among HIV and tuberculosis coinfected women receiving efavirenz-containing ART, and continuation-phase tuberculosis treatment that included rifampicin and isoniazid [[15](#R15)]. Study A5338 tested the hypothesis that clearance of MPA would increase when given with rifampicin and efavirenz, increasing risk of ovulation. Among 42 pharmacokinetic-evaluable women from four African countries, the study showed that of the exposure of MPA was substantially decreased, with the AUC_0–12wks_ being 33% lower than in historical controls [[16](#R16), [17](#R17)], and with MPA concentrations below the therapeutic target of 0.1 ng/mL at week 12 in 12% of women, suggesting that more frequent DMPA dosing may be appropriate.

Plasma exposure of isoniazid and efavirenz vary significantly between individuals due to human genetic polymorphisms. Isoniazid acetylation by hepatic N-acetyltransferase 2 generates hydrazine metabolites [[18](#R18)], and there are well-described loss-of-function *NAT2* alleles [[18](#R18)–[21](#R21)]. Individuals who carry one or two copies of such alleles have intermediate or slow acetylator phenotypes, respectively, and progressively greater plasma isoniazid exposure [[18](#R18)–[21](#R21)]. Plasma efavirenz exposure is predicted by *CYP2B6* polymorphisms [[22](#R22)], especially *CYP2B6* 516G→T (rs3745274) [[23](#R23)–[25](#R25)], 983T→C (rs28399499) [[25](#R25)–[27](#R27)], and 15582C→T (rs4803419) [[25](#R25)].

Rifampicin is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP isoforms, and in a study of 11 healthy, HIV-negative volunteers modestly and variably reduced efavirenz plasma exposure [[28](#R28)]. However, some patients receiving tuberculosis therapy that includes isoniazid with rifampicin experience increased plasma efavirenz exposure, particularly in the presence of *CYP2B6* and/or *NAT2* loss-of-function polymorphisms [[29](#R29)–[31](#R31)]. This effect is likely mediated by isoniazid, as isoniazid alone has also been shown to reduce plasma efavirenz clearance among *CYP2B6* poor metabolizers [[30](#R30)]. The mechanism has been suggested to involve isoniazid inhibition of CYP2A6, a minor pathway for efavirenz elimination that assumes greater importance in *CYP2B6* poor metabolizers [[30](#R30)–[34](#R34)].

The present study seeks to determine whether selected human genetic polymorphisms were associated with plasma pharmacokinetics of MPA among women living with HIV, and who were receiving concomitant isoniazid, rifampicin and efavirenz during participation in A5338.

## METHODS

### Study Population

Study A5338 was a 12-week, phase II, open-label, single-arm study of steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions among HIV and tuberculosis coinfected women receiving efavirenz-based ART and rifampicin plus isoniazid for treatment of tuberculosis [[15](#R15)]. Eligible participants were 18 to 46 years of age, non-pregnant, had been on efavirenz plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for at least 28 days prior to study entry, and were receiving rifampicin (600 mg) and isoniazid (300 mg) at least 5 days per week during the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment. Participants were excluded if they had received DMPA or other injectable contraceptives within 180 days, any other hormonal therapies within 30 days of study entry, were taking CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors within 30 or 7 days, respectively, before study entry, were pregnant or breastfeeding, or had a contraindication to DMPA administration. Participants provided written informed consent. Institutional review boards of the participating institutions approved the study, and participants gave written informed consent.

### Procedures

A detailed description of A5338 procedures and primary results is provided elsewhere [[15](#R15)]. Briefly, at study entry DMPA was administered as a single 150-mg intramuscular injection. Plasma samples for MPA assays were obtained predose and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks post-dose. Adherence to HIV and tuberculosis medications was assessed at all study visits using an ACTG self-report questionnaire [[15](#R15)]. Assays for MPA were performed at the University of Cape Town Pharmacology Specialty Laboratory, using a validated liquid-liquid extraction method and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) with an AB Sciex API 5500Q mass spectrometer.

### Genetic Polymorphisms

Human DNA extracted from whole blood was used to genotype 48 polymorphisms of interest, including 1 in *ANO2* (anoctamin 2), 1 in *CSK* (C-terminal Src kinase), 2 in *CYP19A1* (aromatase), 2 in *CYP1A1*, 7 in *CYP1A2*,1 in *CYP2A6*, 3 in *CYP2B6*, 3 in *CYP3A4*, 1 in *CYP3A43*, 2 in *CYP3A5*, 9 in *NAT2*, 12 in *SLCO1B1* (which encodes organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1), 1 in *TRIM4*, 1 in *UGT1A1*, 1 in *LOC101927066*, and 1 intergenic. These included *CYP2B6* polymorphisms (rs3745274, rs28399499 and rs4803419) that predict plasma efavirenz exposure, and *NAT2* polymorphisms (rs1801279, rs1801280, rs1799930 and rs1799931) that predict plasma isoniazid exposure. The other polymorphisms were selected based on showing genome-wide association (P < 5.0 × 10^−8^) with any estradiol trait in the GWAS Catalog, and *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5* and *CYP1A1* polymorphisms genome-wide associated with any trait in the GWAS Catalog [[35](#R35)]. We also included functional polymorphisms in genes involved in estrogen metabolism [[36](#R36)], including *CYP1A1*, *CYP1A2*, *CYP1B1*, *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5*. Genotyping was done in VANTAGE (Vanderbilt Technology for Advanced Genomics) using MassARRAY® iPLEX Gold (Agena Bioscience^™^, California, USA) and Taqman (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Final assay design is available upon request. Ample blank assays were included to assure validity, and all samples were assayed in duplicate.

We excluded 13 monomorphic loci, and 7 with minor allele frequencies less than 5%. Genotyping efficiency was 100% for all polymorphisms in all participants. All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). Association analyses ultimately included the 28 remaining polymorphisms ([Supplemental Material](#SD1)).

### Statistical analysis

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe the concentrations on MPA using nonlinear mixed effects modelling in the software NONMEM applying first-order conditional estimation algorithm with eta-epsilon interaction (FOCE-I) [[37](#R37)]. The detailed description of the model is provided elsewhere [[15](#R15), [38](#R38)]. Briefly, MPA pharmacokinetics was modelled using a one-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination. To model the release of MPA from the depot in the injection site, a bi-phasic absorption model was used, with a fraction of the dose immediately available for uptake into the bloodstream with a first-order rate, while the remaining fraction is slowly released from the formulation crystals into the injection site, and only then is becomes available for uptake. The slower release process was modelled using a transit compartment model [[39](#R39)]. The model included the effect of body weight on all disposition parameters using allometric scaling [[40](#R40)], and random effects were included on the pharmacokinetic parameters to account for variability between subjects or visits. The model also included drug-drug interaction effects on MPA clearance for anti-tuberculosis treatment plus efavirenz, efavirenz alone, nelfinavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir. These effects were included as a categorical fixed effect for each arm, so all the values of clearance included in this analysis were centered around the typical value for the anti-tuberculosis treatment plus efavirenz arm.

From the final model, we extracted the individual values of the pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., the empirical Bayesian estimates), and the associated “unexplained” variability random effect, which describe the differences between subjects after adjusting for the effect of body weight (which was included in the model as a fixed effect). Additionally, we obtained the individual values of the exposure of MPA in terms of AUC_0–12wk_, terminal half-life, peak concentration (C_max_), and concentration at 12 weeks (C_min_), i.e., when the next injection of DMPA was administered.

These individual pharmacokinetic parameter values, random effects, and exposure metrics were then tested against the genotypes using linear regression models. Associations of *CYP2B6* metabolizer group and *NAT2* acetylator group with each individual pharmacokinetic parameter were assessed by Spearman’s rank correlation test using STATA version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). Associations with the 28 individual polymorphisms were assessed by linear regression using PLINK version 1.07 [[41](#R41)].

Composite *CYP2B6* genotype was defined based on combinations of three polymorphisms as follows: normal metabolizer (1: 15582CC-516GG-983TT or 2: 15582CT-516GG-983TT); intermediate metabolizer (3: 15582TT-516GG-983TT; 4: 15582CC-516GT-983TT; 5: 15582CC-516GG-983CT; 6: 15582CT-516GT-983TT; or 7: 15582CT-516GG-983CT); and poor metabolizer (8: 15582CC-516TT-983TT; 9: 15582CC-516GT-983CT; 10: 15582CC-516GG-983CC [[25](#R25)]. For *NAT2*, genotypes were categorized based on combinations of rs1801280 (*NAT2*5*), rs1799930 (*NAT2*6*), rs1799931 (*NAT2*7*), and rs1801279 (*NAT2*14*), as slow if homozygous for the variant allele at any locus (i.e., AA, CC, AA, AA, respectively), or heterozygous at 2 or more loci; intermediate if heterozygous at a single locus; or extensive if no variant allele at any locus [[42](#R42)]. Associations of pharmacokinetic measures with *CYP2B6* and *NAT2* genotype groups were assessed using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for ordered alternatives. Associations with the 28 individual polymorphisms were assessed by linear regression. For associations with *CYP2B6* and *NAT2* genotype groups, we did not correct for multiple comparisons, as these were our primary focus. We used Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons for the 28 polymorphisms, giving a significance threshold of p = 1.8×10^−3^. We did not correct for comparing the multiple pharmacokinetic parameters, as these tended to correlate with each other. Two-sided tests were used.

## RESULTS

### Participant characteristics

Study A5338 enrolled 62 participants in Botswana (n=7), Zimbabwe (n=8), Kenya (n=12), Durban, South Africa (n=17) and Johannesburg, South Africa (n=18), from whom genotype data were available for all 62, and pharmacokinetic-evaluable data were available for 44. Of the 44 participants, 17 (39%) were *CYP2B6* normal metabolizers, 21 (48%) were *CYP2B6* intermediate metabolizers, and 6 (14%) were *CYP2B6* poor metabolizers. In addition, 5 (11%) were *NAT2* rapid acetylators, 20 (45%) were *NAT2* intermediate acetylators, and 19 (43%) were *NAT2* slow acetylators. At weeks 10 and 12, all women reported 100% adherence to their HIV and tuberculosis medications. Two participants excluded from the primary A5338 publication because they lacked pharmacokinetic results at either week 10 or week 12 [[15](#R15)] were included in the present analyses, as we allowed for participants with results for at least one of the two weeks.

### Genetic associations with MPA pharmacokinetics

Among the 44 evaluable participants, there were no significant associations between *CYP2B6* metabolizer status and any primary pharmacokinetic parameter for MPA, including C_min_ at week 12 (p=0.48), apparent clearance (p=0.60), C_max_ (p=0.59), AUC_0–12wk_ (p=0.99) and half-life (p=0.19). Similarly, considering only the interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters after adjusting for covariate effects, there were no associations with *CYP2B6* metabolizer status, including for clearance (p=0.56), uptake rate (p=0.19) and mean transit time of the slow release (p=0.89). The relationship between *CYP2B6* metabolizer status, MPA C_min_ and MPA clearance is shown in the [Figure](#F1). Individuals with *CYP2B6* poor metabolizer genotypes were no more likely to have subtherapeutic MPA concentrations

Top panel: associations of apparent clearance with CYP2B6 metabolizer status (left) and NAT2 acetylator status (right); Bottom panel: associations of trough concentration with CYP2B6 metabolizer status (left) and NAT2 acetylator status (right). The dashed line indicates the MPA therapeutic cut-off of 0.1 ng/mL. All participants received a single 150 mg intramuscular injection of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Error bars indicate median and interquartile range. Jonckheere-Terpstra test P-values are shown. MPA = medroxyprogesterone acetate; Cmin = trough concentration.

Among the 44 evaluable participants, there was no significant associations between *NAT2* acetylator status and any primary pharmacokinetic parameter, including C_min_ at week 12 (p=0.94), apparent clearance (p=0.85), C_max_ (p=0.21), AUC_0–12wk_ (p=0.62) and half-life (p=0.18). Considering only the unexplained interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters, there were no associations with *NAT2* acetylator status, including for clearance (p=0.65), uptake rate (p=0.18) and mean transit time of the slow release (p=0.14). The relationship between *NAT2* acetylator status, MPA C_min_ and MPA clearance is shown in the [Figure](#F1).

Exploratory analyses beyond *CYP2B6* metabolizer and *NAT2* acetylator status included 28 polymorphisms. There were no consistent associations between any polymorphism and any MPA pharmacokinetic parameter, and none were statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. The lowest p-values for association were as follows: for C_min_ at week 12, *NAT2* rs1799929 (p=0.048); for apparent clearance, C_max_ and AUC_0–12wk_, intergenic rs727428 (p=0.019, p=0.62 and p=0.0028, respectively); and for half-life, *CYP2B6* rs28399499 (p=0.038). Considering unexplained interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters, the lowest p-values for association were as follows: for clearance, *CYP2B6* rs3745274 (p=0.036); for uptake rate, intergenic rs727428 (p=0.016); and for mean transit time of the slow release fraction, *NAT2* rs1799929 (p=0.032). Complete association results for each MPA pharmacokinetic parameter with each polymorphism are in [Supplemental Material](#SD1).

## DISCUSSION

Study A5338 was the first study to document the interaction between DMPA and rifampicin, albeit in combination with efavirenz [[15](#R15)]. It showed that, among HIV and tuberculosis coinfected women receiving efavirenz-containing ART and tuberculosis treatment that included rifampicin and isoniazid, and who were then administered as a single 150 mg intramuscular injection of DMPA, median clearance of MPA was substantially greater than in historical controls [[16](#R16), [17](#R17)], suggesting that more frequent DMPA dosing may be appropriate, most likely to every 8–10 weeks. The present study, based on 44 evaluable participants from A5338, found no substantial associations between either *CYP2B6* metabolizer status or *NAT2* acetylator status and any clinically-relevant MPA pharmacokinetic parameter. Exploratory analyses involving 28 individual polymorphisms found no consistent associations with MPA pharmacokinetic parameters, and no association withstood correction for multiple testing.

The lack of substantial associations of *CYP2B6* metabolizer status with MPA pharmacokinetic parameters is unexpected. Efavirenz is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes that metabolize MPA [[12](#R12), [13](#R13)], and efavirenz has been shown to interact with some hormonal contraceptives [[13](#R13), [14](#R14)]. When efavirenz-based ART was combined with a levonorgestrel-releasing contraceptive implant, *CYP2B6* poor metabolizer genotype was associated with lower levonorgestrel C_max_ and AUC [[43](#R43)]. Similarly, in ACTG study A5316, efavirenz reduced plasma concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, given as a vaginal ring [[13](#R13)], and among 24 women in the efavirenz group in that study, *CYP2B6* poor metabolizer genotype was associated with greater reductions [[44](#R44)]. In contrast, ACTG study A5093, which compared pharmacokinetics of DMPA and selected ART regimens among women living with HIV, found no difference in MPA AUC, C_max_ or clearance between study groups [[16](#R16), [17](#R17)], while a study by Nanda et al. demonstrated higher plasma MPA AUC values among women receiving ART with zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz than those not on ART [[45](#R45)]. It is possible that any modest induction of MPA clearance by efavirenz could not be discerned in the context of the greater induction of CYP3A4 activity by rifampicin [[46](#R46)].

The lack of substantial associations with *NAT2* acetylator status is also somewhat unexpected. There is markedly greater plasma isoniazid exposure with *NAT2* slow acetylator genotypes [[18](#R18)–[21](#R21)]. Although MPA is not a substrate of NAT2, isoniazid is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 [[47](#R47)], and MPA undergoes metabolism by hepatic CYP isoforms, primarily CYP3A4 [[10](#R10)]. Some patients receiving tuberculosis therapy that includes isoniazid with rifampicin experience increased plasma efavirenz exposure, particularly in the presence of *CYP2B6* and/or *NAT2* loss-of-function polymorphisms [[29](#R29)–[31](#R31)], which may involve isoniazid inhibition of CYP2A6 [[30](#R30)–[32](#R32), [34](#R34)]. In ACTG study A5279, which studied rifapentine plus isoniazid for preventing tuberculosis in patients living with HIV [[48](#R48)], *NAT2* slow acetylators had higher plasma concentrations not only of efavirenz, but also of rifapentine, its 25-desacetyl rifapentine metabolite, and nevirapine [[49](#R49)], suggesting inhibitory effects of isoniazid beyond CYP2A6. In the present study, we observed no such increases in plasma MPA exposure among *NAT2* slow acetylators. This study was not designed to distinguish inductive effects of rifampicin from possible inhibitory effects of isoniazid on MPA clearance.

The present study had limitations. Our sample size of 44 evaluable women limited our ability to more thoroughly define genetic associations. However, our small size should be sufficient for detecting pharmacokinetic associations with frequent polymorphisms with large effect sizes, as is true for *CYP2B6* with efavirenz, and for *NAT2* with isoniazid. For example, in ACTG study A5316, an analysis limited to 24 women in the efavirenz group showed a highly significant association (P = 6.7×10^−4^) between *CYP2B6* poor metabolizer genotype and reduced plasma concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, given as a vaginal ring [[44](#R44)]. The exploratory analyses only included 28 selected polymorphisms. Other variants may be associated with pharmacokinetics of MPA, including infrequent polymorphisms that were not included in this analysis. We did not assess whether particular NRTIs affect genetic associations or MPA pharmacokinetic parameters, which seems unlikely. We did not genotype several polymorphisms that were recently associated (although not significant after correcting for multiple testing) with plasma etonogestrel concentrations [[50](#R50)], which is structurally similar to MPA.

In summary, study A5338 suggested that more frequent DMPA dosing may be appropriate for HIV and tuberculosis coinfected women receiving efavirenz-containing ART, and whose tuberculosis treatment included rifampicin and isoniazid. The present analyses suggest that knowledge of *CYP2B6* metabolizer status or *NAT2* acetylator status will not be useful in individualizing DMPA dosing frequency in this setting.
