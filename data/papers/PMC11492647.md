## Abstract

Aim: To evaluate the association between irinotecan safety and the UGT1A1 gene polymorphism in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.

Materials & methods: The studies were systematically searched and identified from three databases (PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library) until 28 February 2023. The relationships were evaluated using pooled odds ratio (OR).

Results: A total of 30 studies out of 600 were included, comprising 4471 patients. UGT1A1*28 was associated with a statistically significant increase in the OR for diarrhea (OR: 1.59, 95% CI = 1.24–2.06 in the additive model; OR = 3.24, 95% CI = 2.01–5.21 in the recessive model; and OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.42–2.69 in the dominant model) and neutropenia (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.40–2.06 in the additive model; OR = 4.10, 95%CI = 2.69–6.23 in the recessive model; and OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.61–2.31 in the dominant model). Subgroup analysis indicated consistent associations in both Asian and non-Asian populations. UGT1A1*6 was associated with a statistically significant elevation in the OR for diarrhea (only in the recessive model, OR = 2.42; 95% CI = 1.14–5.11) and neutropenia (across all genetic models).

Conclusion: The UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 alleles might be a crucial indicator for predicting irinotecan safety in CRC.

## 1. Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) imposes a significant disease burden, resulting in substantial mortality, particularly among individuals aged 50 and above. In 2020, this type of cancer led to 1.9 million new cases and claimed over 930 thousand lives [[1](#CIT00001)]. To address this challenge, numerous advanced methods have been developed for treating CRC patients, in which chemotherapy plays a crucial role.

Among chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan obtained its initial approval from the US FDA in 1996 [[2](#CIT00002)], and is now extensively utilized in the treatment of CRC. Irinotecan acts by inhibiting topoisomerase I, a vital enzyme for cell division, leading to the elimination of cancer cells. Therefore, it contributes to extending patients’ survival and enhancing treatment outcomes [[3](#CIT00003)]. While the effectiveness of irinotecan has been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials, the drug is constrained by a narrow therapeutic range, frequently giving rise to common adverse events such as neutropenia and diarrhea. Irinotecan-related toxicity led to approximately 8–23% of hospitalizations and accounted for about 7% of deaths [[4](#CIT00004)].

Numerous studies have established that irinotecan-induced toxicities primarily result from the active metabolite, SN-38. The *UGT1A1* enzyme, a major metabolizer of SN-38 has been identified as a critical factor contributing to its plasma level [[5](#CIT00005),[6](#CIT00006)]. Polymorphisms of the *UGT1A1*, especially the *UGT1A1*28* allele, alter enzyme activity and reduce the glucuronidation of SN-38, thereby, impacting the response to irinotecan. As a result, in 2005, the FDA issued a warning advising a reduction in the initial irinotecan dosage for patients carrying the *UGT1A1*28* allele. In addition to *UGT1A1*28*, there is a notable association between *UGT1A1*6* and the occurrence of adverse events in CRC patients treated with irinotecan [[2](#CIT00002)].

To date, several meta-analysis studies have been conducted to assess the correlation between both of the *UGT1A1* variants and the safety and effectiveness of irinotecan across various types of cancer [[7](#CIT00007),[8](#CIT00008)]. Specifically concerning CRC patients, two most recent meta-analyses have focused on evaluating the effects of the *UGT1A1*28* and *UGT1A1*6* alleles among CRC patients treated with irinotecan [[9](#CIT00009),[10](#CIT00010)]. The meta-analyses on *UGT1A1*28* included studies published up to 2012 and earlier. Furthermore, few of these studies assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, which could potentially introduce bias due to poor-quality studies. Additionally, given the increasing number of studies conducted on this topic since then, an update is warranted. The current meta-analysis aims to elucidate the association between *UGT1A1*28* and *UGT1A1*6* alleles and the adverse reactions induced by irinotecan in the treatment of CRC.

## 2. Materials & methods

The study reporting adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Supplementary Table S1).

### 2.1. Data source & searching strategy

A systematic review was priorly done to synthesize and collect all data from eligible studies for meta-analysis. The studies were identified until 28/02/2023 from the systematic search on PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library the following search terms: (“Colorectal cancer*” OR “Colorectal tumor*” OR “Colorectal carcinoma*”) AND (“irinotecan” OR “camptothecin-11” OR “camptothecin 11” OR “SN 38 11” OR “SN-38–11” OR “SN3811” OR “SN 38” OR “SN-38” OR “NK012 compound” OR “CPT-11” OR “CPT11” OR “CPR 11” OR “camptosar” OR “7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin” OR “7 Ethyl 10 hydroxycamptothecin” OR “Irinotecan Hydrochloride”) AND (“UGT1A1” OR “UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1” OR “phenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase” OR “1-naphthol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase” OR “phenol GCStransferase” OR “bilirubin uridine-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1A1” OR “UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1” OR “UGT1A1 protein” OR “UGT1A (bilirubin) enzyme” OR “UDP glycosyltransferase 1 family”). The detailed search terms of each database were presented in Supplementary Text S1.

### 2.2. Inclusive & exclusive criteria

Two researchers (Nguyen Thi Minh Thuy and Cuc Thi Thu Nguyen) independently screened the titles and abstracts of each study. If they are eligible to be included, the full texts were reviewed. Studies were selected if they were the cohort or case-control studies, assessed the association between *UGT1A1*28* and/or *UGT1A1*6* alleles and the safety of irinotecan in CRC patients. In cases where multiple studies were conducted on the same population, the most recent and comprehensive study was selected.

Studies were excluded if they lacked sufficient data for pooling, and the authors were unable to provide additional data after two attempts of contact. Additionally, conference abstracts, case reports and series, meta-analyses, or review articles, non-human studies, articles not written in English and those without full texts were excluded.

### 2.3. Data extraction & quality assessment

All data were independently extracted by two reviewers (Nguyen Thi Minh Thuy and Cuc Thi Thu Nguyen) for the systematic review and meta-analysis. The data were categorized into three parts (general characteristics, genes and outcomes and data for pooling). In cases where data for pooling were not reported, the authors of this study were contacted at least two-times to obtain the necessary information. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (the NOS scale) was used to assess the quality of included studies, with only studies scoring over six on the NOS scale being included in the meta-analysis. Any disparity in searching, screening, data extraction and quality assessment was resolved through a discussion with a third party (Phung Thanh Huong).

### 2.4. Data statistics

The association between the *UGT1A1* gene polymorphisms and irinotecan's safety was assessed by the pooled odd ratio (OR) and 95% CIs from at least two studies. The heterogeneity was revealed by the *I*^2^ and *p*-value of Cochran’s Q test (I^2^ less than 50% and Cochran’s Q test *p* > 0.1 were defined as no heterogeneity). The random effects model was used in case of available heterogeneity; otherwise, the fixed effects model was applied. Simultaneously, the meta-regression analysis was performed to find the cause of the heterogeneity, and subgroup analysis was done according to the likely sources of heterogeneity [[11–15](#CIT00011)].

Publication bias was evaluated based on the funnel plot and Egger’s regression test. The contour-enhanced funnel plot was constructed if there was an asymmetric funnel. Finally, the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was determined to assess by including and excluding a single study to evaluate the effect on the pooled results. R version 4.2.3 software was used for analysis. A *p*-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analysis tests, except for the *p*-value of Cochran’s Q test (*p* < 0.1) [[11–15](#CIT00011)].

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Study selection & characteristics

The searching, screening and selecting process from the three databases yielded 30/600 studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for collection and analysis ([Figure 1](#F0001)). Thirty studies reported on the safety outcomes involving 4471 CRC patients [[16–20](#CIT00016)]. Among these, 30 studies involved *UGT1A1*28* with a total of 4471 patients while 13 studies investigated the association with *UGT1A1*6* with a total of 2481 patients.

Prisma flowchart.

The characteristics of 30 studies and the NOS scale are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. The studies evaluating the associations of *UGT1A1* variants with the safety of irinotecan have been carried out and published since 2004, with most in Asia (*n* = 19), followed by Europe (*n* = 10) and America (*n* = 1). The mean age of CRC patients ranged from 50 to 68 years.

In terms of study design, 15 studies were prospective, 14 were retrospective and one study employed both prospective and retrospective designs. The sample size varied across studies, ranging from 20 in the study of Fakih [[21](#CIT00021)] to 661 in the study of Liu [[22](#CIT00022)].

### 3.2. The association between UGT1A1*28 & UGT1A1*6 & irinotecan-induced diarrhea

The pooled results regarding the association between the *UGT1A1* alleles and the adverse event of diarrhea caused by irinotecan in CRC patients are presented in [Table 1](#T0001).

### Table 1.

Table 1 Caption: The association between the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 alleles and diarrhea induced by irinotecan.

Although the dominant and additive models of the *UGT1A1*6* gene did not show a correlation with increased irinotecan toxicity in CRC patients, a significant association with increased diarrhea toxicity was observed in the recessive model (OR = 2.42; 95% CI = 1.14–5.11; *p* = 0.0007) ([Figure 2](#F0002)A), The included studies exhibited heterogeneity (*I*^2^ = 72%; *p* in the Q-test < 0.01) and demonstrated a low risk of publication bias (*p* of Egger’s test > 0.001) ([Figure 2](#F0002)B). Sensitivity analysis revealed that two studies [[23](#CIT00023),[24](#CIT00024)] influenced the pooled result of the dominant model ([Figure 2](#F0002)C). All ethnicity among studies on *UGT1A1*6* were Asian population, so no subgroup analysis was done.

Regarding the *UGT1A1*28* allele, the meta-analysis revealed that CRC patients with the *UGT1A1*28* allele presentation had a significantly higher OR of irinotecan-induced diarrhea across all genetic models. The results suggested that irinotecan used in individuals with the wildtype genotype is safer and better tolerated compared with those carrying the *UGT1A1*28* allele ([Figure 3](#F0003)A & [Figure](#F0003)4A). The studies exhibited no heterogeneity (*I*^2^ < 50%; *p* > 0.1) and showed no evidence of publication bias (*p* of Egger’s test > 0.001) ([Figure 3](#F0003)B & [Figure](#F0004)4B).

The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis demonstrated that no individual study significantly affected the baseline pooled result (Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed statistically significant associations between the *UGT1A1*28* and diarrhea adverse events in both Asian and non-Asian populations (except for *UGT1A1*28* among Asian population in the homozygous comparison) (Supplementary Figure S2).

### 3.3. The association between UGT1A1*28 & UGT1A1*6 & irinotecan-induced neutropenia

The pooled results of the association between the *UGT1A1* gene and the neutropenia adverse event of irinotecan in CRC patients are presented in [Table 2](#T0002).

### Table 2.

| Genetic model | No. of studies | OR | 95% CI | p-value | p-value of Q test | I2 | p-value of Egger test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UGT1A1*6 and neutropenia |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Additive model | 10 | 1.63 | 1.11–2.37 | 0.0172 | 0.1547 | 32% | 0.3003 |
| Dominant model | 8 | 3.49 | 2.19–5.57 | 0.0004 | 0.7207 | 0% | 0.6716 |

Table 2 Caption: The association between the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 alleles and neutropenia induced by irinotecan.

Regarding the neutropenia adverse event associated with irinotecan and the *UGT1A1* polymorphic alleles, the pooled results in [Table 2](#T0002) indicated a statistically significant association between the *UGT1A1*6* and *UGT1A1*28* alleles and the neutropenia adverse event of irinotecan across all genetic models.

There was homogeneity (*I*^2^ < 50%; *p* > 0.001) and no evidence of publication bias (*p* of Egger’s test > 0.001) across all studies and genetic models. The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis demonstrated that no individual study notably affected the baseline pooled results (Supplementary Figures S3 & S4). Additionally, the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed statistically significant associations between the *UGT1A1*28* and neutropenia adverse events in both Asian and non-Asian populations (Supplementary Figure S5).

## 4. Discussion

The influence of the *UGT1A1* gene, encoding the major metabolizing enzyme, on the toxicity of irinotecan has been assessed through numerous individual studies across various ethnicities, yielding highly inconsistent results [[25](#CIT00025)]. To date, two meta-analyses have been conducted on the impact of the two most well-known alleles of this gene on irinotecan toxicity in CRC patients. One meta-analysis was published in 2014, focusing on the association between the *UGT1A1*28* allele and neutropenia and diarrhea induced by irinotecan, comprising 16 individual studies involving Caucasian patients [[26](#CIT00026)]. In 2020, another meta-analysis was conducted on the association with the *UGT1A1*6* allele, comprising nine studies [[9](#CIT00009)]. Therefore, our meta-analysis includes data from 30 studies on the *UGT1A1*28* allele (in patients of various ethnicities) and 14 studies on the UGT1A1*6 allele, providing the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on the association between the *UGT1A1* variants and irinotecan toxicity in CRC patients.

Severe diarrhea is a common ADR associated with irinotecan, significantly impacting patients’ quality of life and treatment adherence. Our pooled results reveal a notable association, particularly in the recessive model of *UGT1A1*6*, indicating increased susceptibility to diarrhea toxicity. CRC patients carrying at least one *UGT1A1*6* allele (A instead of G) have a risk of experiencing diarrhea when undergoing irinotecan treatment, that is more than twice as high as individuals with the wildtype genotype.

This finding aligns with the results reported in the meta-analysis conducted by Zhu, which encompassed nine individual studies [[9](#CIT00009)]. Meanwhile, we observed a significantly elevated OR of irinotecan-induced diarrhea across all genetic models of *UGT1A1*28*. Notably, patients with the *28/*28 genotype exhibited a tripled risk of severe diarrhea compared with those with the wildtype genotype. This OR surpasses that reported in the meta-analysis conducted by Liu et al. in 2014, the difference could be explained by our inclusion of a substantially larger number of studies [[26](#CIT00026)]. Additionally, Liu’s meta-analysis primarily targeted the Caucasian population under the assumption that the frequency of *UGT1A1*28* is notably low in other ethnic groups such as Asians or Africans. However, our study conducted subgroup analyses, revealing significant associations between *UGT1A1*28* and the adverse event of diarrhea across both Asian and non-Asian populations, with comparable odds ratios. Interestingly, the frequency of this allele in certain Asian and African populations such as the Indians and the Kenyans is even higher than that observed in some European countries [[27](#CIT00027)].

Neutropenia is another severe and even life-threatening ADR, associated with irinotecan treatment, a major risk factor for infection related morbidity and mortality. It has been reported to occur in more than 70% of elderly metastatic CRC patients [[28](#CIT00028)]. In our study, the pooled results revealed a statistically significant association between both *UGT1A1*6* and *UGT1A1*28* alleles and the adverse event of neutropenia caused by irinotecan across all genetic models. The highest ORs were observed when comparing the homozygous genotype with polymorphic alleles to the homozygous wildtype genotype.

These findings are consistent with those observed in previous meta-analyses. The presence of the seven TA repeat allele (*UGT1A1*28*) significantly reduces the expression of *UGT1A1*, leading to decreased glucuronidation of SN-38, the toxic metabolite of irinotecan. Similarly, the *UGT1A1*6* (rs4148323) is a missense polymorphism in exon 1 that results in a modified amino acid sequence and dysfunction of the corresponding enzyme [[4](#CIT00004)]. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed statistically significant associations between the *UGT1A1*28* and neutropenia adverse events in both Asian and non-Asian populations, suggesting the global impact of this allele.

Although numerous studies have confirmed the increased risk of ADRs in patients using irinotecan carrying the *UGT1A1*6* and particularly the *UGT1A1*28* alleles, the inconsistency in the results of these studies has led to discrepancies in the guidelines provided by reputable pharmacogenomics organizations. While PharmGKB categorizes the risk associated with *UGT1A1*28* as level 1A, accompanied by recommendations to reduce the starting dose and guide dosing based on neutrophil count [[29](#CIT00029)], the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has not yet issued guidelines related to this allele. Furthermore, current guidelines still do not acknowledge the association between *UGT1A1*6* and neutropenia in CRC patients using irinotecan. Although the systematic searching process from only three databases might lead to omitting the included studies, the results of the current meta-analysis contribute to elucidating the role of the two most important polymorphic alleles related to the clearance of irinotecan, aiding as biomarkers in the implementation of personalized treatment to select appropriate chemotherapy protocols for each patient to minimize the risk of drug toxicity.

The quality of individual studies and the presence of publication bias are the most critical factors influencing the quality of a meta-analysis. In our study, publication bias assessed by funnel plot and Egger’s regression test was found to be negligible. Furthermore, in most analyses, the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis demonstrated that no individual study significantly affected the baseline pooled results. However, the included studies exhibited heterogeneity, as indicated by the *I*^2^ and the *p*-value of Cochran’s Q test. Additionally, there is another important limitation in our study. The influence of the *UGT1A1* variants should be evaluated concerning their interactions with additional genetic polymorphisms, as well as clinical factors like dosage, duration of treatment, potential drug interactions and comorbidities. Besides the *UGT1A1*, several other genetic polymorphisms such as *ABCG2* and *CES1* have been reported as pharmacogenetic factors affecting the response to irinotecan [[30](#CIT00030)]. All of these factors should be considered in a multifactorial analysis in future studies.

## 5. Conclusion

The *UGT1A1*28* allele might be a crucial indicator for predicting adverse reactions of irinotecan in CRC. Similarly, the *UGT1A1*6* exhibited a significant association with the toxicities of irinotecan, except for the dominant and additive models in the diarrhea adverse event. Besides adverse reactions, further studies should pay much attention to effectiveness and several other loci.

## 6. Future Perspective

Although our subgroup analysis showed consistent associations across Asian and non-Asian populations, there is a need for further validation in other ethnic groups to confirm the generalizability of these findings. Large-scale studies in underrepresented populations will help refine the predictive models for irinotecan toxicity.
