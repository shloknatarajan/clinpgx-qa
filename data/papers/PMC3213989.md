## Abstract

Intrauterine smoke exposure (IUS) is a strong risk factor for development of airways responsiveness and asthma in childhood. Runt-related transcription factors (RUNX1–3) have critical roles in immune system development and function. We hypothesized that genetic variations in RUNX1 would be associated with airway responsiveness in asthmatic children and that this association would be modified by IUS. Family-based association testing analysis in the Childhood Asthma Management Program genome-wide genotype data showed that 17 of 100 RUNX1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly (P < 0.03–0.04) associated with methacholine responsiveness. The association between methacholine responsiveness and one of the SNPs was significantly modified by a history of IUS exposure. Quantitative PCR analysis of immature human lung tissue with and without IUS suggested that IUS increased RUNX1 expression at the pseudoglandular stage of lung development. We examined these associations by subjecting murine neonatal lung tissue with and without IUS to quantitative PCR (N = 4–14 per group). Our murine model showed that IUS decreased RUNX expression at postnatal days (P)3 and P5 (P < 0.05). We conclude that 1) SNPs in RUNX1 are associated with airway responsiveness in asthmatic children and these associations are modified by IUS exposure, 2) IUS tended to increase the expression of RUNX1 in early human development, and 3) a murine IUS model showed that the effects of developmental cigarette smoke exposure persisted for at least 2 wk after birth. We speculate that IUS exposure-altered expression of RUNX transcription factors increases the risk of asthma in children with IUS exposure.

Keywords: methacholine provocation, airway hyperresponsiveness

## METHODS

Study protocols were approved by the Partners Human Research Committee and the Harvard Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Subjects gave written, informed consent for use of discarded surgical material and completion of a questionnaire regarding cigarette usage. For the CAMP clinical trial, each parent or legal guardian provided consent, with each child proband giving assent for the clinical trial; separate consent/assent was obtained for the genetics ancillary study in CAMP.

### 

#### Animals.

Study animals were housed in pathogen-free conditions, with ad libitum food and water. Daily exposure of female C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Waltham, MA) to the smoke of three 3R4F research cigarettes (University of Kentucky), five times per week, started at age 10 wk. Lung tissue samples from the offspring were collected at embryonic days (e) 15.5 and 17.5, the day of birth (P0), and postnatal day 3 (P3), P5, P7, P10, and P14.

#### Real-time qPCR.

RNA extraction was performed by using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer's instructions and was followed by reverse transcription to cDNA (Retroscript, Ambion/Applied Biosystems) as previously described ([23](#B23)). Two lung tissue samples were pooled for each *N* from the e15.5 samples. Single lung tissue samples were analyzed for all other time points. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using validated Taqman primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) was performed as previously described on murine and developing human lung tissue samples ([23](#B23)). The *RUNX* and T-bet primers (catalog numbers: human *RUNX1* Hs 01021971_m1, murine *RUNX1* Mm 01213405_m1, murine *RUNX2* Mm 00501584_m1, murine *RUNX3* Mm 00490666_m1, and murine T-bet Mm 00450960_m1) spanned an intron and normalized to the endogenous control, 18S (Hs 99999901_s1).

#### Immunostaining.

Immunostaining was carried out as previously described ([23](#B23)) on paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections by use of murine monoclonal anti-RUNX1 (Santa Cruz, at 10 μg/ml) and rabbit polyclonal anti-cytokeratin (used at 11 μg/ml, Dako Cytomation). The negative control antiserum was irrelevant IgG2b. Double staining to identify cell types immunopositive for RUNX1 was carried out as previously described ([23](#B23)), using rabbit polyclonal anti-cytokeratin to stain epithelial cells (used at 11 μg/ml, Dako Cytomation). Hematoxylin and eosin staining using standard protocols was performed to assess tissue architecture for 14 developing human lung tissue samples with a history of maternal smoking and 21 without a history of maternal smoking.

#### CAMP genotype analyses.

CAMP was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. Trial design and methodology have been published ([1](#B1)). Information regarding maternal smoking was obtained by using self-report on a validated questionnaire. We examined the provocative concentration of methacholine required to cause a 20% decrement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV_1_) (FEV_1_PC_20_), as measured during the run-in period of the clinical trial, a period during which no asthma controller medications were taken. The FEV_1_PC_20_ was chosen since this measurement has been shown to be affected by intrauterine cigarette smoke exposure ([11](#B11)).

Genomewide SNP genotyping was performed in the CAMP sample by Illumina (San Diego, CA) on the HumanHap550 v3 BeadChip as detailed previously ([26](#B26)). All markers had greater than 90% genotyping completion rate, with the average completion rate for each marker over 99%. From 561,466 markers present on the BeadChip, 547,645 markers (97.54%) passed all quality control metrics ([26](#B26)). No filtering was done based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because of ascertainment of the cohort through affected probands.

#### Statistical methods.

Expression differences between groups were analyzed by Student's *t*-test for normally distributed data. Data that were not normally distributed were analyzed by nonparametric statistical tests (Mann-Whitney). Association of *RUNX1*, *RUNX2*, and *RUNX3* SNPs with FEV_1_PC_20_ were analyzed by family-based association testing (FBAT), a generalization of the transmission disequilibrium test that allows for valid testing of association with any phenotype, sampling structure, and pattern of missing marker allele information ([30](#B30)). We focused on nominal levels of association (*P* < 0.05) using an additive genetic model. Each SNP meeting these criteria was then evaluated for significant interaction with IUS (binary variable), via a gene-environment interaction analysis in FBAT.

## RESULTS

### 

#### RUNX1 is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness in pediatric asthma.

[Table 1](#T1) demonstrates the characteristics of the CAMP population evaluated in our genetic association study. Just over 10% of the genotyped subjects were reported as exposed to intrauterine smoke. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the smoke-exposed and non-smoke-exposed probands in regard to age, sex, duration of asthma, baseline lung function (FEV_1_), or baseline airways responsiveness (FEV_1_PC_20_) ([Table 1](#T1)). DNA samples from 422 family trios yielded completed genotypes in 1,169 subjects including 403 CAMP probands and their parents. The average genotyping completion rate for each subject was 99.75%. From the genome-wide association SNP dataset, we extracted the SNPs located on chr21:35,076,968–35,348,465 (HG 18), a region encompassing the human *RUNX1* gene and 10 kb, both 5′ and 3′ of the gene; 100 SNPs from the HumanHap550v3 Beadchip mapped to this region.

Table Caption: Comparison of CAMP subjects with and without a history of intrauterine smoke exposure

Of the 100 *RUNX1* SNPs examined, 17 were nominally associated with FEV_1_PC_20_ under the additive model, with *P* values ranging from 0.03 to 0.04 ([Table 2](#T2)). Analysis of linkage disequilibrium patterns of the 17 SNPs revealed only one pairing with significant linkage disequilibrium (*r*^2^ ≥ 0.80), suggesting that these associations are independent or in linkage disequilibrium with an additional, untyped, RUNX1 variant. In contrast, an examination of 11 *RUNX3* SNPs did not show any association with the FEV_1_PC_20_ (data not shown). Examination of 40 *RUNX2* SNPs showed two SNPs that were associated with the FEV_1_PC_20_, but these associations were not modified by IUS (data not shown).

Table Caption: Initial significant RUNX1 SNP associations with FEV1PC20 in CAMP

Given the consistent identification of maternal smoking as a risk factor for pediatric asthma, we next tested the 17 *RUNX1* SNPs for significant interaction with IUS. This analysis showed that the association between airways hyperresponsiveness, and one SNP, rs11702779, was significantly modified by IUS (interaction *P* = 0.0009) ([Fig. 1](#F1)). This SNP, located in a noncoding region, results in an AA genotype instead of AG or GG. Compared with the major alleles, the AA genotype was associated with increased airway responsiveness (lower FEV_1_PC_20_) in children without tobacco exposure. In contrast, whereas children with the AA genotype who were exposed to cigarette smoke also demonstrated increased in airway responsiveness compared with tobacco-naive AA children, this increase was less marked than that observed in smoke-exposed children with the AG or GG genotypes ([Fig. 1](#F1)). The effects of the AA genotype on the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness compared with the wild-type AG or GG genotypes depended on the presence or absence of an environmental exposure, cigarette smoke. Thus the effects of the AA genotype on airway hyperresponsiveness showed a gene-by-environment interaction.

Genotypic analysis of CAMP genome-wide database showing that intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure alters the association between RUNX1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and airway responsiveness, as assessed by methacholine responsiveness [provocative concentration of methacholine required to cause a 20% decrement (PC20) in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (FEV1PC20)]. In children without a history of intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure (no smoke), both the AG and GG SNPs are correlated with greater doses of methacholine required to cause a 20% decrease in FEV1, consistent with protection against airway hyperresponsiveness. However, in children with a history of intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure (smoke), these wild-type genotypes are associated with greater sensitivity to methacholine, as shown by the decreased log FEV1PC20 in these subjects. In contrast, children with the AA minor allele SNP have heightened sensitivity to methacholine regardless of maternal smoking history, with the subjects who were positive for intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure showing greater sensitivity to methacholine than the subjects without prenatal tobacco smoke exposure. Thus, in the “no smoke” condition, the minor allele is associated with greater sensitivity to methacholine, but in the “smoke” condition the minor allele is somewhat protective regarding airway hyperresponsiveness. The effects of the minor allele SNP thus vary with the environmental exposure to tobacco smoke.

*RUNX1* expression has been investigated in embryonic murine lung but has not been well studied in developing human lung. We therefore used qPCR analysis to examine the expression of mRNA for RUNX1 in 20 samples of developing human lung (gestational ages between 10 and 22 wk) obtained from discarded surgical material. Information regarding maternal cigarette smoking was obtained by maternal questionnaire. This analysis demonstrated that, similar to murine lung, *RUNX1* is expressed in the human lung at both the pseudoglandular and canalicular stages of lung development. In the pseudoglandular stage (*N* = 3 without and 3 with IUS), gestational age 10–15 wk, maternal smoking was associated with a slight trend toward greater *RUNX1* mRNA expression compared with tobacco-naive samples ([Fig. 2](#F2)).

![Fig. 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c847/3213989/7fb4b23f3d44/zh50101159510002.jpg)

Quantitative PCR analysis of developing human lung, normalized for 18S expression, showing expression of the mRNA for RUNX1 at both the pseudoglandular (N = 6, 3 each with and without intrauterine cigarette smoke exposure) and the canalicular (N = 14, 7 each with and without cigarette smoke exposure) stages of development. At the pseudoglandular stage, RUNX1 expression showed a slight trend toward increased expression in the samples with intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure. In the canalicular stage, intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure did not change the expression of RUNX1. Line indicates median normalized expression. Ps, pseudoglandular stage; Can; canalicular stage; NS, no maternal smoking history; IUS, positive maternal smoking history, resulting in intrauterine smoke by-product exposure.

Not all mRNAs expressed during fetal lung development are transcribed to protein ([71](#B71)). Additionally, maternal smoking was not associated with inflammatory infiltrates in developing human lung tissue samples (*N* = 21 without a history of maternal smoking, *N* = 14 with a history of maternal smoking) analyzed by H&E staining ([Fig. 3](#F3), *A* and *B*). The lack of substantial inflammatory cell infiltrates raised the possibility that RUNX protein might not be transcribed in the fetal lung. Therefore, we next evaluated whether RUNX1 protein could be detected in paraffin-embedded developing human lung tissue samples. Immunostaining demonstrated cells immunopositive for RUNX1 at both the pseudoglandular and canalicular stages of lung development (*n* = 22), with immunopositive cells located predominantly in cartilage and epithelium. No staining was observed following substituting an irrelevant IgG for the primary antibody ([Fig. 4](#F4), *A* and *B*). Double staining with the epithelial cell marker cytokeratins confirmed the expression of RUNX1 in these cells ([Fig. 4](#F4), *C*–*F*). This pattern of RUNX1 expression was similar to that observed in murine lung development ([40](#B40), [42](#B42)).

#### Maternal smoking alters RUNX transcription factor expression in a murine model of prenatal cigarette smoke.

Our human studies raised the possibility that a history of maternal smoking was associated with a trend toward increased *RUNX1* mRNA expression in developing lung in at least the pseudoglandular stage of lung development. However, these studies did not have the statistical power to fully analyze this question. Additionally, our human studies did not determine whether any relationship between maternal smoking and increased *RUNX1* was causal. To address these questions, we studied the expression of the RUNX transcription factors in a murine model of prenatal cigarette smoke exposure. We adapted a well-established adult murine model ([24](#B24)) of mainstream cigarette smoke exposure to permit us to study the developmental effects of maternal smoking on the lungs of the offspring. The inhaled particulates from our model are 310.6 mg/m^3^, which is comparable with murine cigarette smoke exposure models used by other investigators studying mainstream cigarette smoke exposure in adult mice ([60](#B60)).

We tested the hypothesis that maternal smoking causes abnormalities in the RUNX transcription factors by comparing the expression of mRNA in lung tissue from mice with and without IUS. RNA was extracted from whole lung tissue samples from e15.5, e17.5, P0, P3, P5, P7, P10, and P14; *n* = 4–14 for each group at each time point. Each time point included mice from at least two litters. The RNA was reversed transcribed to cDNA and subjected to qPCR analysis. 18s expression was used to normalize mRNA levels in the samples; 18s was used since it is not regulated during lung development. This analysis showed that immature murine lung expresses the mRNA encoding the three RUNX transcription factors at all time points examined. Similar to the findings in developing human lung, there was a trend toward increased *RUNX1* expression in the cigarette smoke-exposed samples at e17.5. IUS significantly decreased *RUNX1* mRNA expression in the alveolar stage of lung development, at P3 and P5; trends toward decreased expression were noted at P0, P7, and P10 ([Table 3](#T3)).

Table Caption: Quantitative PCR analysis of RUNX1 transcription factor in developing murine lung with and without prenatal tobacco smoke exposure

We next used qPCR to determine whether tobacco smoke exposure during lung development caused abnormal mRNA expression for other RUNX transcription factors. Similar to the findings observed with RUNX1, mRNA for *RUNX3* was significantly (*P* < 0.05) decreased at P3 and P5 in lung tissue from mice exposed to cigarette smoke during lung development compared with tobacco-naive mice (data not shown). In contrast, cigarette smoke exposure during lung development significantly (*P* < 0.05) decreased the mRNA for *RUNX3* only at P3 (data not shown).

Given the association between both RUNX1 and RUNX3 and T-bet, we next examined the murine lung tissue samples to determine whether gestational cigarette smoke exposure altered T-bet mRNA expression. This quantitative PCR analysis did not show any differences in T-bet expression between the mice with and without cigarette smoke exposure during development (data not shown).

## DISCUSSION

This study shows that a prenatal environmental exposure, IUS, modifies the association between genetic variations in the transcription factor RUNX1 and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic children, alters RUNX transcription factor expression in murine developing lung, and raises the possibility that transcription is also altered in human developing lung. Our limited human studies did not have the statistical power to address this issue fully. FBAT in asthmatic children indicated an association between genetic variation in *RUNX1* and increased responsiveness to methacholine as assessed by the FEV_1_PC_20_. This association was modulated by a history of prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke: the AA genotype correlated with increased sensitivity to methacholine in children without tobacco exposure, as evidenced by a lower FEV_1_PC_20_, and this was only slightly exacerbated by prenatal tobacco smoke exposure. In contrast, both the AG and GG genotypes did not have an association with the FEV_1_PC_20_ in tobacco-naive asthmatic children but were associated with increased methacholine responsiveness following prenatal tobacco smoke exposure. Thus the minor allele AA genotype was associated with increased airway responsiveness in tobacco-naive asthmatic children but was slightly protective in the setting of IUS. Our data therefore show a gene-by-environment interaction for *RUNX1*. Family-based methods, such as FBAT, are robust to population stratification and therefore spurious results from ancestral allele frequency differences in our population are highly improbable. Surprisingly, an analysis of 11 *RUNX3* SNPs did not show any association between genotype and the FEV_1_PC_20_. Similarly, analysis of 40 *RUNX2* SNPs showed that two SNPs had associations with the FEV_1_PC_20_, but neither of these were modified by a history of IUS.

We further investigated the association between the RUNX transcription factors and the immature lung by comparing the expression of *RUNX1* in developing human lung tissue with and without prenatal tobacco smoke exposure. Our analysis showed that prenatal tobacco smoke exposure correlated with a slight trend toward increased *RUNX1* expression in the pseudoglandular stage of lung development and confirmed that RUNX1 protein is robustly expressed in human fetal lung during both the pseudoglandular and canalicular stages. Taken together, these findings support the plausibility of the fetal origins of disease hypothesis that was proposed by Barker and colleagues ([5](#B5)).

The pseudoglandular and canalicular stages of lung development are important for branching morphogenesis, the establishment of the basic structure of the lung, and the differentiation of critical lung cell types. The RUNX transcription factors modulate the maturation of cartilage and muscle cells ([59](#B59), [69](#B69)). Of note, increased airway wall size is found in children exposed to prenatal maternal smoking ([17](#B17)). It is possible that abnormal RUNX expression during lung development could affect the lung structures such as airway wall thickness, which could contribute to airway obstruction after birth.

We investigated whether the changes in *RUNX1* following prenatal tobacco smoke exposure could be causal by examining the expression of the RUNX transcription factors in a murine model of developmental exposure to cigarette smoke. The use of a murine model for these analyses allowed us both to determine whether prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke by-products caused abnormalities in RUNX transcription factor mRNA expression in the lungs of the offspring and to examine RUNX mRNA expression in the saccular and alveolar stages of lung development. As was suggested by the findings in our human studies, our murine experiments showed that maternal smoking resulted in abnormal RUNX transcription factor expression in the lungs of the offspring. As we found in human developing lung, IUS caused a trend toward increased *RUNX1* expression in the embryonic murine lung, although this was seen in the canalicular stage in the murine samples and the pseudoglandular stage in the human lung tissue samples. Additionally, in our murine model, IUS caused decreased *RUNX1* expression in lung tissue samples at P3 and P5, in the alveolar stage of lung development. These differences could be due either to differential expression between mouse and human immature lung tissue or to the human and murine studies sampled representing different stages of lung development. Of note, the greatest effects of IUS on murine lung *Runx* expression were observed at the alveolar stage of lung development, which occurs entirely after birth in the mouse. In humans, this stage of lung development occurs very late in gestation and is completed in infancy. Our findings suggest that tobacco smoke components might change the regulation of the RUNX transcription factors in the immature lung. This study therefore supports the concept that the RUNX transcription factors as targets of maternal smoking in the immature murine and human lung.

There are several possible mechanisms whereby gestational exposure to maternal cigarette smoking could alter RUNX expression. Components of cigarette smoke, including nicotine and lipid soluble mediators, directly modulate transcription factor expression in vitro ([14](#B14), [27](#B27), [31](#B31)–[33](#B33), [67](#B67)). Nicotine also impacts the epigenetic modulation of gene expression ([47](#B47)). Additionally, maternal smoking causes uterine artery constriction ([2](#B2)) and placental abnormalities ([74](#B74)) and so could indirectly affect fetal expression of transcription factors.

Our study extends prior work examining the RUNX transcription factors in the lung. Lian and colleagues ([42](#B42)) showed that RUNX1 is expressed in the fetal and adult murine pulmonary epithelium. Our study confirms this finding and demonstrates similar expression in developing human pulmonary epithelium. A study by Chae and colleagues ([10](#B10)) demonstrated an association between a *RUNX* promoter polymorphism and IgE levels in Korean asthmatic patients. Our study shows that a different polymorphism is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness in a large cohort of asthmatic children. Similar to the study by Chae et al., our study confirms that RUNX transcription factor genetic variation is associated with asthma phenotypes. The differences between the two investigations may be due to the different populations studied: Korean adult asthmatic patients and asthmatic children in the United States.

There are three RUNX transcription factors: RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3. This family has important roles in immune function and cartilage and bone formation. Additionally, they can act as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors ([9](#B9), [34](#B34), [38](#B38), [41](#B41), [45](#B45), [62](#B62)). *RUNX1*, located on chromosome 21, has been best studied in relation to acute myelogenous leukemia ([22](#B22), [44](#B44)). It has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as RA and SLE ([61](#B61), [66](#B66), [72](#B72)). Lack of Runx1 prevents the formation of fetal hematopoietic cells and is embryonic lethal ([51](#B51), [52](#B52)). Runx2, located on chromosome 6, is essential for skeletal development ([54](#B54)). Mice lacking *Runx2* die shortly after birth ([54](#B54)), and abnormal *Runx2* expression has been associated with the human disease cleidocranial dysplasia ([48](#B48), [53](#B53)). Additionally, *RUNX2* abnormalities have been reported in metastatic breast and prostate cancer and in T cell lymphoma ([8](#B8)). *RUNX3*, located on chromosome 1, modulates thymocyte maturation and promotes the development of CD8 cells by activating the CD4 silencer ([49](#B49), [65](#B65)). The Runx3-deficient mouse displays transient spontaneous pulmonary infiltrates and increased IgE ([41](#B41)). Thus these transcription factors have critical roles in modulating immune cell development and function.

There are several possible mechanisms whereby abnormalities in RUNX transcription factor expression could contribute to the asthma phenotype. RUNX transcription factors are required for thymocyte maturation and B cell function and modulate CD4 expression by binding to the IL-4 silencer ([3](#B3), [7](#B7), [15](#B15), [49](#B49), [58](#B58), [65](#B65)). Increased RUNX1 expression increases CD8 cell number ([25](#B25)); however, these cells do not function normally. Thus increased RUNX1 could result in impaired responses to viral infections, which can result in increased IL-13, which would, in turn, favor an asthmatic phenotype ([36](#B36)). Additionally, RUNX1 promotes IL-17 expression; therefore overexpression could increase this proinflammatory cytokine ([75](#B75)). Recent studies indicate that RUNX1 also has nonimmune cell functions that could also promote an asthma phenotype. For example, RUNX1 promotes angiogenesis and muscle cell growth ([69](#B69)). Thus it is feasible that abnormal RUNX1 expression could contribute to airway remodeling, which is a typical finding in both asthma and IUS ([17](#B17)). Our findings show that developing human lung epithelial cells express RUNX1. Dysregulation of epithelial cell cytokine expression has been shown in asthma ([28](#B28), [29](#B29), [43](#B43)); therefore it is feasible that abnormal epithelial cell RUNX1 expression could promote asthma. Abnormal expression of the other RUNX transcription factors could additionally promote asthma: RUNX3 deficiency in mice results in spontaneous eosinophilic lung infiltrates ([19](#B19)). Persistent eosinophilic infiltration is typical of the pathology of human asthma. We speculate that maternal smoking could promote asthma in the offspring by causing abnormal expression of transcription factors such as RUNX1 and RUNX3.

A limitation of this study is that our data do not permit us to determine whether the association of rs11702779 and airway hyperresponsiveness due to IUS is causal or whether that SNP in *RUNX1* is in linkage disequilibrium with another variant causing the airway hyperresponsiveness. This polymorphism is in a noncoding region of the *RUNX1* gene; however, recent investigations have determined that these areas may have important regulatory functions ([35](#B35)). Further molecular genetics studies to determine the functional SNP are warranted. Another limitation is that the size of the CAMP genotype database is also relatively small, which limits the power of our analysis. We would anticipate that additional associations would be identified in a larger population samples. However, despite its small size, the CAMP database has the advantage of a very detailed phenotypic characterization of the subjects who participated in this study for several years.

In summary, our findings support the concept that environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, during fetal development might contribute to lung dysfunction after birth. Our murine data show significant changes in postnatal RUNX expression in the lung tissue of mice with exposure to cigarette smoke by-products during lung development. We speculate that the changes in the three RUNX transcription factors following developmental tobacco smoke exposure and the known importance of this family in regulating immune function raise the possibility that the abnormal expression patterns of these transcription factors contributes to the increased susceptibility to asthma following prenatal tobacco smoke exposure. Our data show that IUS can contribute to postnatal lung disease by both direct and indirect mechanisms: IUS changes transcription factor expression, and modulates the impact of SNPs in lung genes. Further studies to investigate the interaction of IUS with the developing lung genome are needed to characterize the ways in which IUS predisposes children to develop asthma, with the goal of identifying new therapeutic targets for this important disease.
