## Abstract

**Purpose:** 
Chemoradiotherapy using 5-fluorouracil has shown to be effective treatment for rectal cancer. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important target enzyme for the fluoropyrimidines. However, the predictive role of TS levels in early stage rectal cancer is not yet well understood. We analyzed the value of TS gene polymorphisms as a predictive marker in patients with stage II and III rectal cancer treated with preoperative concomitant radiotherapy and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.

**Methods and materials:** 
Between 1998 and 2007, blood samples were obtained from 51 patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. Forty patients were T2–3 (78%), 11 were T4 (22%), and 59% were N+. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, and the genotypes were analyzed using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and automated sequencing techniques.

**Results:** 
The *3/*3 thymidylate synthase genotype was associated with a higher response rate (pathological complete remission and microfoci residual tumor; 61 vs. 22% in *2/*2 and *2/*3; P = 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, the *3/*3 thymidylate synthase genotype was also an independent prognostic factor for better survival (P < 0.05).

**Conclusions:** 
The thymidylate synthase genotype might help to identify patients with stage II/III rectal cancer who could benefit from pre- and postoperative fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.

### Purpose

Chemoradiotherapy using 5-fluorouracil has shown to be effective treatment for rectal cancer. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important target enzyme for the fluoropyrimidines. However, the predictive role of TS levels in early stage rectal cancer is not yet well understood. We analyzed the value of TS gene polymorphisms as a predictive marker in patients with stage II and III rectal cancer treated with preoperative concomitant radiotherapy and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.

### Methods and materials

Between 1998 and 2007, blood samples were obtained from 51 patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. Forty patients were T2–3 (78%), 11 were T4 (22%), and 59% were N+. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, and the genotypes were analyzed using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and automated sequencing techniques.

### Results

The *3/*3 thymidylate synthase genotype was associated with a higher response rate (pathological complete remission and microfoci residual tumor; 61 vs. 22% in *2/*2 and *2/*3; *P* = 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, the *3/*3 thymidylate synthase genotype was also an independent prognostic factor for better survival (*P* < 0.05).

### Conclusions

The thymidylate synthase genotype might help to identify patients with stage II/III rectal cancer who could benefit from pre- and postoperative fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.

## Introduction

Over the last two decades, combined preoperative chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) has been adopted in Europe as standard treatment for rectal cancer. This treatment decreases the incidence of recurrence in about 50% of cases and increases the percentage of conservative tumor resections (Sauer et al. [2004](#CR23)).

The drug most widely used in this setting is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a folate-pathway inhibitor that has been available for 50 years (Meyerhardt and Mayer [2005](#CR18)). On activation to the nucleotide form, this fluoropyrimidine develops a stable complex with thymidylate synthase (TS), inhibiting the activity of the enzyme (Longley et al. [2003](#CR15)). TS catalyzes a critical reaction for cell proliferation, consisting of a reductive methylation of dUMP by 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to form dTMP (Danenberg [1977](#CR1)). There is an inverse correlation between TS activity and effectiveness of 5-FU.

Several genetic polymorphisms in the gene coding TS have been described. The first of these is located in the 5′-UTR region and consists of a variation in the number of the 28-base-pair (bp) tandemly repeated sequence (VNTR) (Horie et al. [1995](#CR5)). Alleles with two (TS*2) and three (TS*3) repeats are the most common. The number of tandem repeats affects TS activity levels: TS mRNA with a three-repeat sequence has greater translational efficiency than that with a two-repeat sequence (Kawakami et al. [1999](#CR11), [2001](#CR12)). The second polymorphism (Mandola et al. [2003](#CR17)) is a G>C SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) at the 12th nucleotide of the second repeat in the TS*3 alleles. This substitution changes a critical residue in the USF E-box consensus element, abolishes the USF-1 binding, and alters transcriptional activity. Additional studies (Kawakami and Watanabe [2003](#CR10)) have confirmed the presence of the G>C change and classified each polymorphic allele as *2G, *2C, *3G, or *3C in accordance with the combination of the SNP and VNTR. A final classification of the TS alleles would be: (1) high-expression genotypes (2R/3G; 3C/3G; 3G/3G) and (2) low-expression genotypes (2R/2R; 2R/3C; 3C/3C) (Fig. [1](#Fig1)). The existence of a third polymorphism, an infrequent TS *2 allele type carrying a G>C base change in the 12th nucleotide of both 28-bp repeats, has also been described (Gusella et al. [2006](#CR4)). In a previous work, we demonstrated that the number of USF-binding sites in the promoter region of the TS gene could be used to predict outcome in patients treated with a 5-FU-based regimen (Pare et al. [2008](#CR21)). Furthermore, in the 3′ untranslated region of the TS gene, a frequent polymorphism, consisting of a 6-bp deletion, was discovered through searching the public Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database (Ulrich et al. [2000](#CR27)).

Genetic polymorphisms in the 5′-UTR region of thymidylate synthase gene

In the present work, we analyzed the value of TS gene polymorphisms as a predictive marker in patients with stage II and III rectal cancer treated with preoperative concomitant radiotherapy and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.

## Materials and methods

### Patients

Fifty-one patients with locally advanced rectal cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2007 were included in the study. The median follow-up was 53.6 months (range, 1–119 months). Eligibility criteria included: (1) ≥18 years of age; (2) an ECOG <3; (3) adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin ≥10 g/dl, neutrophil count ≥1,500/μl, and platelet count ≥100,000/μl); (4) adequate renal and liver function (serum creatinine and bilirubin <1.5× the upper limit of normal and AST and ALT ≤5× the upper limit of normal). Colonoscopy was performed in all patients to confirm tumor location (0–15 cm from the anal verge) and to carry out the histological study. A rectal exam, an abdominal–pelvic computerized tomography, chest X-rays, opaque enema, endorectal ultrasonography, and analytical determination of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were also performed. Written informed consent was obtained and the study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.

Rectal cancer was defined as a tumor with its lowest margin within 12 cm of the anal verge on endoscopy or location below the peritoneal reflection (Tepper et al. [2002](#CR26)).

### Therapeutic protocols

All patients included in the study were treated preoperatively with radiotherapy consisting of megavoltage irradiation (Co^60^ or 18 meV linear accelerator) to the pelvis, with a total dose of 45 Gys over 5 weeks. All patients received concomitant chemotherapy, either with a 5-day infusion (1,000 mg/m^2^) at the beginning and end of radiation treatment (20 patients), a daily continuous infusion of 5-FU (225 mg/m^2^) during the entire radiotherapy period (24 patients), or concomitant oral capecitabine 825 mg/m^2^ twice a day on each day of the radiotherapy (7 patients). Resection surgery was performed in all patients 6–8 weeks after the preoperative treatment. Further adjuvant treatment after surgery was left to the discretion of the treating physician. Thirty-two of the 51 patients (63%) also received 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Evaluation of the pathological response

Relevant clinical data (gender, age, ECOG, etc.) were obtained from clinical records. Clinical and radiological parameters were analyzed before and 4 weeks after CT–RT and compared with the measurement of the resected tumor. Response to treatment was considered as: (1) complete remission (CR) when the tumor mass disappeared and (2) partial remission (PR) when a 50% decrease in evaluable lesions was observed. Patients were considered to have stable disease (SD) when there was neither response to treatment nor progression of the disease. Disease progression during or after treatment was also taken into account.

Tumor regression was graded according to histopathological findings of the surgical specimen: (1) no evidence of residual carcinoma (CRp); (2) presence of residual microfoci of carcinoma (Rmic); (3) partial regression with clear evidence of residual cancer cells, but with predominant fibrosis; (4) residual cancer cells outgrowing fibrosis. Evaluation was performed by a single pathologist (FJS-P) blinded to patient characteristics and genotype status. To correlate biomarkers and disease, patients were divided into 2 groups, responders (CRp + Rmic) and non-responders (all others) (Mandard et al. [1994](#CR16); Dworak et al. [1997](#CR3)). Tumor downstaging was determined by comparing pretreatment T and N stage with the pathologic stage of the surgical specimen (Janjan et al. [1999](#CR9)).

Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the beginning of treatment until death from any cause. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the beginning of treatment until tumor recurrence or death.

### Genetic studies

The genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes by the salting-out procedure (Miller et al. [1988](#CR19)). The following polymorphisms were analyzed in the thymidylate synthase gene:

For the 28-bp VNTR polymorphism and the C>G SNP analysis, a DNA fragment was amplified using previously described PCR conditions and primers (Horie et al. [1995](#CR5)). These polymorphisms were analyzed by direct automated DNA sequencing on an ABI PRISM 3100 (Applied Biosystem, Foxter City, CA USA).

As the G to C substitutions change a critical residue in the USF E-box consensus element, abolishing USF-1 binding and altering transcriptional activity, TS genotypes were classified according to the number of functionally binding sites (those with a G residue in the 12th position of the repeat). We classified the TS alleles according to the number of active binding sites (high-expression alleles being those with three or more USF, and low-expression alleles those with less than three USF).

The 6-bp deletion in nucleotide 1494 (TTAAAG) was amplified using previously described PCR conditions and primers (Dotor et al. [2006](#CR2)). The −6-bp allele (152 bp) and the +6-bp allele (158 bp) were identified with 12% polyacrylamide gel and silver staining, and subsequently checked by sequencing.

### Statistical analyses

The differences between categorical variables were measured by the χ^2^ test. Logistic regression was used as a multivariate method to ascertain which variables independently predicted response after adjustment for other relevant clinical variables. Logistic regression included the genotype variables, the functional state (ECOG), sex, age, concurrent chemotherapy protocols, degree of infiltration (T), lymph node involvement (N), and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (preCEA). Kaplan–Meier estimates and log-rank tests were used in the univariate analysis of overall survival and progression-free survival. The Cox regression method was used for the multivariate analyses of OS and PFS. Results were considered statistically significant when *P* values were less than 0.05.

## Results

### Clinical results

Table [1](#Tab1) shows the patients’ baseline clinical and tumor characteristics. Lymph node involvement was diagnosed in the pretreatment staging in 30 patients (59%) and after the surgical intervention in 17 patients (33%). Three patients had unresectable tumors after CT–RT; two remained disease-free more than 3 years after a second line of CT and posterior radical resection surgery; while the third patient died due to loco-regional disease progression. Eighty-five percent of the patients (41/48) had an R0 resection, and fifteen percent (7/48) had an R1–R2 incomplete resection. An anterior resection with sphincter preservation was performed in 31 patients (61%), a Miles’ abdominoperineal amputation was performed in 18 patients (35%), and a laparotomy with colostomy was required in the two remaining cases.

Recurrence was observed in 15 patients (29%); it was both local and metastatic in one patient, local in five, and distant in nine patients. The main site of relapse was liver (7 patients).

Under preoperative concomitant radiotherapy and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, 4 patients (7.8%) had complete clinical response, 31 had PR (61%), and 16 had SD (31%). No progression of disease was observed during CT–RT in any patient. A complete pathological response (CRp) was seen in 4 patients (7.8%; 95% CI: 1–15%), and only residual microfoci (Rmic) were found in 14 (27.5%; 95 CI: 15–39%). Fifty percent of patients (17/34) with pN0 tumors had an objective response (RCp + Rmic) while only 6% (1/27) in the group of patients with pN1–N2 tumors responded to treatment (*P* = 0.002).

Tumor downstaging was observed in 24 patients (47%) after CT–RT, while no downstaging was seen in the 27 remaining cases (53%). Sixty-three percent of patients with downstaging (15/24) responded to CT–RT, in contrast with only 11% of patients (3/27) without downstaging (*P* < 0.0001).

Patients with ECOG 0–1 presented a higher pathological response rate (78%) than those with an ECOG >1 (22%; *P* = 0.02). No significant differences were found in the response of patients grouped according to other clinical parameters.

### Genetic determinants and pathological response

The following TS VNTR frequencies were found in the studied DNA samples: *2/*2 in 8 patients (16%), *2/*3 in 25 patients (49%), and *3/*3 in 18 patients (35%). Table [2](#Tab2) shows the relationship between the TS genotypes and pathological regression. Patients with a homozygous *3/*3 genotype presented a CRp + Rmic percentage that was considerably higher than those with a heterozygous *2/*3 and homozygous *2/*2 genotype (61 vs. 22%; *P* = 0.013).

Table 2 Caption: TS genotype and pathological regression

When considering the association between the presence of the high/low TS expression alleles and the response, a higher response rate was observed in patients carrying high-expression alleles, although this was not significant. A similar pattern was observed when the response was evaluated in relation to the number of USF binding sites in the promoter region of the TS gene. There was no association between the 6-bp deletion polymorphisms and response (Table [2](#Tab2)). No relationship was observed between the different TS genotypes and downstaging.

In the logistic regression analysis, the VNTR genotype was the only independent factor that predicted the probability of pathological regression (*P* = 0.004; CI 95%: 0.012–0.43).

### Clinical and genetic determinants and survival

OS at 5 and 10 years was 82 and 62%, respectively. PFS at both 5 and 10 years was 59%. The only significant difference (*P* = 0.02) in patients’ PFS in relation to a clinical parameter was observed when considering the patients’ functional state (ECOG) (Fig. [2](#Fig2)). We also observed a trend toward better OS in patients with a good performance status (*P* = 0.08).

Table [3](#Tab3) shows the results of the univariate analysis of OS and PFS in relation to the genetic determinants. Only the TS genotype was associated with significant differences in OS; while cases with a *3/*3 genotype had a median survival of 111 months, median survival in the remaining cases was 84 months (*P* = 0.037). Among patients with the 3/*3 genotype, 80% were still alive at the 10-year follow-up versus 51% of the genotypes *2/*2 and *2/*3 (Fig. [3](#Fig3)). Likewise, the median PFS was 100 months in genotype *3/*3 and 68 months in the genotypes *2/*2 and *2/*3. With a median PFS of 80 months (95% CI, 66–94 months), we observed that patients with genotype *3/3 presented 75% PFS while patients with genotype *2/2 and *2/3 had 51% (*P* = 0.043; log-rank test) (Fig. [4](#Fig4)).

The Cox regression model included the genotype variables, ECOG, sex, age, concurrent chemotherapy protocols, T, N, preCEA, and adjuvant treatment. The TS VNTR genotype in the promoter region (*P* = 0.037; HR = 0.2 CI 95%: 0.044–0.91) and the ECOG (*P* = 0.047; HR = 3.07 CI 95%: 1.01–9.3) were independent predictors of overall survival after adjustment for the other clinically relevant variables. These two variables were also predictors of PFS (*P* = 0.026; HR 0.2 CI 95%: 0.088–0.86 for VNTR and *P* = 0.011; HR 3.5 CI 95%: 1.33–9.38 for ECOG) (Table [4](#Tab4)).

## Discussion

The percentage of patients with locally advanced rectal tumors who achieve a complete pathological response using preoperative CT–RT remains low. Although CRp rates are often used and have proven to be a good end point to correlate with long-term survival in CT–RT trials, Rmic rates do not clearly show this correlation. For this reason, it has been suggested that other end points such as circumferential or radial margin resection (CRM/R0) and 3-year disease-free survival should be investigated. These prognostic factors are obtained after surgery, and to improve these results, there is a need to establish preoperative selection criteria. Promising research suggests that a pharmacogenetic strategy appears to be of great interest in this scenario.

As 5-fluorouracil is used in all preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimes today, the study of the TS—the molecular target of this drug—is clearly of interest as a possible prognostic/predictive pharmacogenetic factor. Few groups have addressed this issue to date.

In several reports, Jacob et al. have analyzed TS levels using different methods in the same group of 40 patients, and they compared results with a number of biological parameters. In an initial study, they described the significant relationship between pathological regression and low TS expression measured by immunohistochemistry in patients treated neoadjuvantly with CT–RT based on 5-FU (Jakob et al. [2005](#CR6)). In a subsequent paper, a high intratumoral TS expression was shown to be predictive of an unfavorable prognosis (Jakob et al. [2006](#CR7)). These authors also reported that DFS and OS were significantly increased in patients with downstaging when compared to patients without downstaging, but no significant correlation was found between cancer recurrence and pathological regression after preoperative CT–RT. The same group of researchers later investigated the predictive value of Ki67 and p53 and their correlation with TS expression. This was measured by quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR in RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. High TS expression was correlated with a high Ki67 index, and no significant association was found between p53 and TS mRNA expression or tumor regression. TS expression was also associated with the cell proliferation rate as a consequence of a close relationship with Ki67. However, the combination of the two markers (Ki67 and TS expression) did not significantly improve the response prediction (Jakob et al. [2008](#CR8)).

More recently, these authors performed a genotypic study in the same group of patients, and they concluded that the TS 6-bp deletion polymorphism in the 3′ region of the gene may be an important predictor for histopathological tumor regression while the TS 5′ polymorphisms were not associated with either tumor regression or gene expression (Stoehlmacher et al. [2008](#CR25)).

Summarizing these results, it appears that a high TS expression is associated with worse response to treatment and an unfavorable prognosis.

Three further studies by three different groups have focused on the role of TS as a prognostic or predictive marker of CT–RT treatment in patients with rectal cancer. In the first of these, DNA was extracted from immediately frozen homogenized biopsies obtained during the preoperative colonoscopy in 65 patients. The authors demonstrated for the first time that polymorphisms of the repeated sequences in the enhancer region of the TS gene promoter may predict downstaging after preoperative CT–RT. Homozygous *3/*3 patients presented a lower probability of downstaging than homozygous *2/*2 or heterozygous *2/*3 patients (22 vs. 60% *P* = .036). In addition, downstaging may be an important clinical predictor for both local control and disease-free survival (30% of 3-year DFS in patients without downstaging versus 88% in patients with downstaging; *P* = 0.017) (Villafranca et al. [2001](#CR28)).

In another study, the predictive value of a combination of three gene polymorphisms—TS, epidermal growth factor receptor Sp1-216, and epidermal growth factor A61G—was analyzed. The authors included pretreatment blood samples from 60 patients with locally advanced rectal tumors treated with radiotherapy and concomitant oral chemotherapy with UFT. Patients with TS *2/*2 genotype had a significantly higher rate of complete pathological response than those with *2/*3 or *3/*3 genotypes. They proposed a combination of these markers as predictors of complete pathological response (Spindler et al. [2007](#CR24)).

In a very recent study, TS levels in the pretreatment biopsies from 57 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were measured by immunohistochemical methods. For the first time, high TS levels were associated with a high response rate (CRp + Rmic; *P* = 0.015), and no such correlation was found in the group of patients treated with RT alone. Multivariate analysis confirmed a significant interaction between nodal status and the probability of achieving a pathological response (*P* = 0.023) and between a high TS level and a high pathological response in the CT/RT subset (*P* = 0.007) (Negri et al. [2008](#CR20)).

In the present work, we investigated the role of the TS genotype as a predictive marker in a group of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing CT–RT. The outcome was evaluated simultaneously considering three relevant parameters: pathological response, pathological regression, and tumor downstaging. Clinical parameters in all patients were evaluated by the same oncologist (DP) and pathological response was measured by the same pathologist (FJS-P), guaranteeing homogeneity of clinical-pathological criteria. Furthermore, both investigators were blinded to the genetic results. We found that the functional status (ECOG) was a good predictive factor in relation to tumor response and relapse. In accordance with previously reported studies (Lindebjerg et al. [2009](#CR14); Liersch et al. [2006](#CR13); Rödel et al. [2005](#CR22)), lymph node status was also a valuable predictive factor, with a significantly higher pathological response rate in pN0 patients than in those with pN1–N2 tumors (50 vs. 6%; *P* = 0.002). The TS *3/*3 genotype significantly predicted patients who benefit from CT/RT 5FU-based treatment (*P* = 0.013); this benefit translated into higher progression-free survival (*P* = 0.043) and higher overall survival (*P* = 0.037) for this group of patients. Although our results contradict those of Villafranca et al. ([2001](#CR28)), they are in agreement with more recent data obtained using immunohistochemical methods (Negri et al. [2008](#CR20)).

Several explanations may account for these controversial findings regarding the pharmacogenetic role of TS in patients with rectal cancer. First of all, there is considerable diversity in the methods used to measure TS expression. Although the most commonly used technique has been immunohistochemical determination, other semiquantitative methods have employed different RT–PCR techniques and scales. Regarding the immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, comparison of the previously mentioned studies is often difficult as the lack of standardization of this technique allows marked interobserver variation. Such technical limitations might be overcome by blood analysis for germline polymorphisms, as presented in this study. Secondly, variables related to the tumor sample must be considered. In some of the reported studies, TS expression was analyzed in pretreatment biopsies while in others it was examined in post-treatment samples. Consequently, phenotypic changes due to therapy cannot be excluded. And finally, diagnostic and/or therapeutic differences could also explain the controversial results. The limitations in the radiological diagnosis of rectal cancer may be related to the lack of correlation between the downstaging and the different clinical and genotypic variables. More accurate and more sensitive diagnostic tests are therefore needed to define the size and degree of infiltration of the tumor and to determine lymph node involvement. Until now, the most important prognostic and predictive factors commonly used to evaluate tumor response and survival are pathological tumor regression, lymph node involvement, and downstaging, but other ends points such as CRM/R0 resection seem more relevant. The different therapeutic regimens used in the above-mentioned studies could also play a role in the discordant results reported to date. Prospective studies that overcome all these methodological limitations are needed to clarify the relationship between the TS genotype and response to treatments containing 5-FU.

As an increasing number of patients with rectal cancer are being treated with a neoadjuvant approach that includes fluoropyrimidines, in depth investigation into the pharmacogenetic markers of these drugs is an issue of major concern.
