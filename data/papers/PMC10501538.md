## Abstract

**OBJECTIVES:** 
Carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-seizure drug, is widely prescribed for the management of focal seizures. At a given therapeutic dose, CBZ exhibits marked interindividual variation in the plasma CBZ levels. The aim wasto study the influence of EPHX1 c.337 T>C and UGT2B7*2 genetic polymorphisms on plasma carbamazepine (CBZ) levels in persons with epilepsy (PWE) from South India.

**METHODS:** 
115 PWE belong to South India origin who are on carbamazepine monotherapy were recruited. Genotyping of the two variants weredone using RT-PCR method. PWE who had seizure freedom for one year and their last dose which was not changed for one year duration were included and their plasma levels of CBZ and its active metabolite CBZ 10,11 epoxide were analysed by reverse phase HPLC.

**RESULTS:** 
In EPHX1 c. 337 (T>C) polymorphism, the PWE carrying CC had lower plasma CBZ levels when compared to CT genotype (2.45 μg/ml vs 3.15 μg/ml. In UGT2B7*2, PWE carrying homozygous mutant TT had higher levels when compared with CT (3.09 μg/ml vs 2.74 μg/ml) genotype but found no statistical significance. Mutant genotype of EPHX1 (CC) had higher metabolic ratio compared to TT genotype (1.33 vs 1.17) but not found to be statistically significant. Mutant genotype of UGT2B7*2 (TT) was found to be having lower metabolic ratio when compared with CC genotype (1.18 vs 1.35; p value =0.08).

**CONCLUSION:** 
PWE carrying EPHX1 c.337 T>C (rs1051740) and UGT2B7*2 (rs7439366) genetic polymorphisms did not affect the plasma CBZ levels and metabolic ratio of PWE of South Indian origin. However, this finding should be confirmed in a larger sample size which may help in optimization and personalized CBZ therapy in South Indians.

However, this finding should be confirmed in a larger sample size which may help in optimization and personalized CBZ therapy in South Indians.

## Introduction

Carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-seizure drug, is widely prescribed for the management of focal seizures. At a given therapeutic dose, CBZ exhibits marked interindividual variation in the plasma CBZ level. Further, it works in a narrow therapeutic margin of 4–12 mcg/mL.[[1](#ref1)] The measurement of CBZ levels will help clinicians since therapeutic and toxic effects are better correlated with plasma drug levels. Any change in the plasma CBZ levels could be due to several reasons that include genetic or nongenetic factors.

Genetic polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) present in the genes coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of CBZ lead to a change in enzymes' activity, which in turn alters the plasma CBZ levels resulting in either therapeutic failure or toxicity. *EPHX1* gene codes microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), and by means of epoxidation, CBZ 10.11 epoxide (CBZ 10.11 epoxide) is converted to form inactive diols.[[2](#ref2)] In the reported SNP (rs1051740), there is a nucleotide change from T to C at the 337^th^ position resulting in a change from tyrosine to histidine at the 113^th^ position.[[3](#ref3),[4](#ref4)]

N-glucuronide is formed by the process of glucuronidation with the help of UGT2B7.[[5](#ref5)] Replacement of tyrosine at the 268^th^ position in *UGT2B7*2* (rs7439366) results in decreased plasma CBZ levels, thereby necessitating increased CBZ dose among persons with epilepsy (PWE) of the Chinese population.[[6](#ref6)]

Indian population is 1210 million; out of which the South Indian population (genetically distinct) contributes around 242 million as per the 2011 Census of India.[[7](#ref7),[8](#ref8)] In South India, the minor allele frequencies of *EPHX1* c. 337 T > C and *UGT2B7*2* were 40%.[[9](#ref9)] We reported that these genetic polymorphisms did not affect CBZ maintenance dose in South India,[[10](#ref10)] and the impact of these genetic variants on the plasma CBZ levels and metabolic ratio is to be studied in PWE from South India for optimization of the drug therapy.

## Methods

### Study settings

PWE belonging to South India and taking CBZ monotherapy as a maintenance dose (the dose is unaltered for 1 year and not having seizures for 1 year and more) were recruited. Pregnant, lactating women and PWE having liver or kidney dysfunction were excluded.

### Sample size calculation

It was done by keeping an alpha value of 0.05, power of 90%, and expected effect size of the genetic contribution of respective genes in variation in drug concentration as 0.66 mg/L with a standard deviation of 0.5, recruitment of 18 wild-type genotypes, 18 heterozygous genotypes, and 18 mutant-type genotypes based on the codominant model were required.[[4](#ref4)] To match the allele frequency, the sample size was calculated to be 115. Calculations were done using G*Power (ver.3.1.9.2. Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany).

### Study procedure

The Ethics Committee approval was obtained. PWE satisfying the eligibility criteria were recruited after getting informed written consent. The detailed history of PWE was noted in the case record pro forma. The pill count was used to find out the adherence to drug treatment. The difference between the dispensed and counted pills is the measured pill count. Under aseptic precautions, 5 mL of venous blood was collected.

### Sample processing for genotyping

Sample centrifugation was done at 2500 RPM for 10 min at 4°C. The phenol-chloroform method was used for DNA extraction, and samples having a minimum of 50 μg/mL were utilized for genetic analysis. Genotyping of two SNPs was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction method. In codominant model, CC is mutant, CT is heterozygous, and TT is wild for *EPHX1* c. 337 T > C. The study outline is summarized in [Figure 1](#F1).

Study workflow. CBZ: Carbamazepine, PWE: Persons with epilepsy, HPLC: High performance liquid chromatography

### Estimation of plasma carbamazepine levels and its metabolite

Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assayed plasma CBZ levels and its metabolite. The active metabolite contributes around 15%–55% of CBZ levels, and hence, the levels of the metabolite were also measured. A phosphate buffer was used as the mobile phase. Preparation of the standards in Milli-Q water and spiked standards in the plasma was done, followed by an extraction procedure. HPLC conditions included a flow rate at 1 mL/min with two detectors UV and photodiode array with a wavelength of 200 nm. The column used was C18 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm), and this was said to be nonpolar due to the addition of carbon atoms to silica at the temperature of 25°C. The time required for the particular compound for travelling through the column to the detector is retention time. The concentration of CBZ and CBZ 10.11 epoxide was calculated using Class Vp Software (Shimadzu). The metabolic ratio was calculated by dividing the plasma CBZ levels and CBZ metabolite (10, 11 epoxide) levels.

### Statistical analysis

The Chi-square test was utilized to check expected and observed allele frequencies for the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was done for the normality testing. For the genotypes of two SNPs, analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences in the plasma CBZ levels and metabolic ratio with a suitable *post hoc* test. For the dominant and recessive models, an unpaired *t*-test was used. Correlation between the plasma CBZ level and the metabolic ratio was done using Pearson/Spearman, whichever is appropriate for the data normality.

## Results

Men were preponderant (56%) out of the recruited 115 PWE. The median plasma level of CBZ of PWE was 2.86 (2.05–4.33). Other details are presented in [Table 1](#T1).

The impact of the studied SNPs (rs1051740 and rs7439366) on the plasma CBZ levels and dose-normalized plasma CBZ levels is shown in [Table 3](#T3). In *EPHX1* c. 337 (T > C) polymorphism, the PWE carrying CC had lower plasma CBZ levels when compared to the CT genotype (2.45 μg/mL vs. 3.15 μg/mL) (conversion of the natural logarithm of plasma CBZ to plasma CBZ level using e^lnplasma CBZ level), but not found to be statistically significant between *EPHX1* genotypes.

In *UGT2B7*2*, PWE carrying homozygous mutant genotype (TT) had higher levels when compared with CT (3.09 μg/mL vs. 2.74 μg/mL) (conversion of the natural logarithm of plasma CBZ to plasma CBZ level using e^lnplasma CBZ level) and found no statistical significance between the above *UGT2B7* genotypes and plasma CBZ levels [[Table 4](#T4)]. In both SNPs, dose-normalized plasma CBZ levels (calculated by the plasma CBZ level divided by weight-normalized CBZ dose) did not find any difference between the genotypes of the two SNPs and dose-normalized plasma CBZ levels in all three models.

The metabolic ratio was higher in the PWE carrying mutant “C” allele, i.e. both heterozygous and homozygous genotypes when compared to the wild-type (TT) genotype of *EPHX1* (1.33 vs. 1.17; 1.28 vs. 1.17); however, these differences in the metabolic ratio between genotypes were not found to be statistically significant in all three genetic models [[Table 5](#T5)]. The effect of the *UGT2B7*2* genotype (dominant model) on metabolic ratio is shown in [Table 6](#T6). The mutant genotype of *UGT2B7*2* (TT) was found to be having lower metabolic ratio when compared with the CC genotype (1.18 vs. 1.35; *P* = 0.08). Correlation analysis was done as an exploratory analysis between CBZ 10.11 epoxide and maintenance dose requirement. The analysis showed a positive trend between CBZ maintenance dose and CBZ 10.11 epoxide with a correlation coefficient of 0.35 with *P* < 0.01 [[Figure 2](#F2)].

Correlation between CBZ maintenance dose and CBZ 10.11 epoxide levels. CBZ: Carbamazepine

## Discussion

mEH, coded by *EPHX1*, is responsible for the metabolism of CBZ. Although we did not find any significant association *(EPHX1)* with dose-normalized levels, there was a lower trend of levels in the CC genotype in comparison with the TT genotype, indicating that *EPHX1* c. 337 T > C has an effect on levels of CBZ similar to the results found in Yun *et al*.[[11](#ref11)] done in Chinese epileptic patients. The lower plasma CBZ in the CC genotype noted in our study was similar to the observations although it focused more on hospitalized patients influencing the reliability of the results.[[12](#ref12)] The study done by Hung *et al*. in Taiwan showed that the C allele is related to an increase in mEH activity and so reduced plasma CBZ levels.[[4](#ref4)] The rationale for the conflicting reports is due to the change in minor allele frequency of *EPHX1* among various ethnic groups.

*UGT2B7*2* (rs7439366) results in alteration at the 268^th^ position from histidine to tyrosine, and this enhances the enzyme (UGT2B7) activity resulting in low plasma CBZ levels requiring increased CBZ dose in Chinese epileptic patients.[[6](#ref6)] In our study, although no association was noted, there was a trend of the TT genotype having high CBZ levels pointing toward the decrease in the activity of UGT2B7 with genetic polymorphisms. The metabolic ratio was also not found to be significant in consistent with findings by Ma *et al*.[[13](#ref13)]

We did not notice any serious adverse effects (data not shown) in any PWE, and this finding may be due to the presence of low CBZ 10.11 epoxide since higher levels of the active metabolite may result in adverse effects. The levels of plasma CBZ in our study were found to be 3.6 μg/mL (median: 2.86 μg/mL), which was found to lie nearer to the therapeutic range (4–12 μg/mL); however, the study by Greenberg *et al*. mentioned that the efficacy of CBZ concentrations ranges between 1.9 and 11.7 μg/mL.[[14](#ref14)] Further, all PWE in our study are responding to CBZ maintenance dose therapy and are free from a seizure disorder. In our clinical practice, clinicians prefer dose titration based on clinical response rather than drug levels.

The strength of our study is that patients who take only CBZ were enrolled to minimize the CBZ metabolism when prescribed polytherapy. This study finding will be helpful to the clinicians as they need not be concerned about these two SNPs while prescribing CBZ to PWE living in South India. The study limitation is that we have conducted this study with lesser sample size. The study findings are not generalizable since allele frequencies of the studied SNPs will be different in different populations. Earlier, we found that the impact of *CYP3A5*3* on dose-adjusted CBZ levels is minimal.[[15](#ref15)] Hence, the other genes such as *CYP3A5* and *ABCB1* should be included with these two SNPs to make us know better regarding their role on CBZ drug levels.

## Conclusion

To conclude, PWE carrying *EPHX1* c. 337 T > C (rs1051740) and *UGT2B7*2* (rs7439366) polymorphisms did not have an impact on the plasma CBZ levels.
