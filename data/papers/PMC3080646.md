## Abstract

**AIMS:** 
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Its red blood cell (RBC) metabolite concentrations (6-thioguanine [6-TGN] and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides [6-MMPN]) are related to drug response. We investigated the impact of non-genetic covariates and pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) on 6-MP metabolism and response.

**METHODS:** 
Sixty-six children with ALL treated according to EORTC 58951 protocol were included in this study. Six patients had a heterozygous genotype for the most common TPMT polymorphisms, nine for ITPA 94 C > A and 17 for ITPA IVS2+21 A > C. 6-MP metabolites concentrations were analyzed by mixed model analysis.

**RESULTS:** 
During maintenance, steady-state RBC 6-TGN concentrations were lower in patients aged 6 years or younger (493 pmol/8 × 108RBC) than in older children (600 pmol/8 × 108RBC). 6-MMPN concentrations were low in patients with TPMT variant/wild-type ITPA (1862 pmol/8 × 108RBC), intermediate in wild-type patients and high (16468 pmol/8 × 108RBC) in patients wild-type TPMT/variant ITPA. A 6-MMPN threshold of 5000 pmol/8 × 108RBC was associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity.

**CONCLUSION:** 
In this study, age and both TPMT and ITPA genotypes influenced 6-MP metabolism. High 6-MMPN was associated with hepatotoxicity. These pharmacological tools should be used to monitor ALL treatment in children.

### AIMS

6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Its red blood cell (RBC) metabolite concentrations (6-thioguanine [6-TGN] and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides [6-MMPN]) are related to drug response. We investigated the impact of non-genetic covariates and pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine methyltransferase (*TPMT*) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (*ITPA*) on 6-MP metabolism and response.

### METHODS

Sixty-six children with ALL treated according to EORTC 58951 protocol were included in this study. Six patients had a heterozygous genotype for the most common *TPMT* polymorphisms, nine for *ITPA 94 C* > *A* and 17 for *ITPA IVS2*+*21 A* > *C*. 6-MP metabolites concentrations were analyzed by mixed model analysis.

### RESULTS

During maintenance, steady-state RBC 6-TGN concentrations were lower in patients aged 6 years or younger (493 pmol/8 × 10^8^RBC) than in older children (600 pmol/8 × 10^8^RBC). 6-MMPN concentrations were low in patients with *TPMT* variant/wild-type *ITPA* (1862 pmol/8 × 10^8^RBC), intermediate in wild-type patients and high (16468 pmol/8 × 10^8^RBC) in patients wild-type *TPMT*/variant *ITPA*. A 6-MMPN threshold of 5000 pmol/8 × 10^8^RBC was associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity.

### CONCLUSION

In this study, age and both *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes influenced 6-MP metabolism. High 6-MMPN was associated with hepatotoxicity. These pharmacological tools should be used to monitor ALL treatment in children.

## Introduction

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy representing approximately 30% of all childhood malignancies and 80% of paediatric leukaemias [[1](#b1)]. The prognosis of this disease has dramatically improved over the last 30 years, with a 5 year survival of 90%. [[2](#b2)]. A further increase in the survival rate will depend on a reduction in drug-related toxicity, resulting in less interruption of chemotherapy and fewer relapses of the disease [[3](#b3), [4](#b4)]. Therefore, there is a need to tailor treatment to the individual in order to limit drug-related toxicity and improve survival of high risk patients.

The success of treatment is attributed in part to the 18–24 months of adequate maintenance therapy necessary to prolong the remission obtained during the initial treatment phases. Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX) are the cornerstones of ALL maintenance therapy [[5](#b5)]. Both drugs exert their antileukaemic effect by the inhibition of *de novo* purine synthesis (DNPS). At low doses the combination of these two drugs results in a synergistic antileukaemic action [[6](#b6)]. MTX inhibits dihydrofolate reductase which is essential for purine synthesis [[7](#b7)]. 6-MP is a prodrug metabolized by multiple enzymatic steps of the purine salvage pathway [[8](#b8), [9](#b9)]: the anabolic pathway through the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) produces 6-thioinosine monophosphate, and then 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). 6-TGN is incorporated in nucleic acids or with phosphate in 6-thioinosine triphosphate (TITP), a process than can be reversed by inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA). Catabolic pathways are through xanthine oxidase (XO) inactivating 6-MP to 6-thiouric acid and through thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) metabolizing 6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMPN) which inhibit DNPS.

It is well established that the balance between 6-TGN and 6-MMPN is highly variable and primarily influenced by genetic polymorphisms of TPMT [[10](#b10)]. In patients receiving 6-MP, the inter-individual variability in red blood cell (RBC) concentrations of 6-TGN and 6- MMPN is known to influence efficacy and side effects, with a high risk of myelosuppression in homozygous TPMT-deficient patients [[11](#b11), [12](#b12)]. However, additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding enzymes involved in 6-MP metabolism may also influence its efficacy and toxicity [[13](#b13)].

In this study, we measured RBC 6-TGN and 6-MMPN concentrations in ALL patients receiving 6-MP during maintenance therapy to explore 6-MP metabolic variability. We also evaluated the combined impact of patients' covariates, *TPMT* and *ITPA* pharmacogenetic polymorphisms and RBC 6-TGN and 6-MMPN concentrations on the occurrence of drug toxicity during the same period.

This study did not investigate correlations with drug doses or blood counts.

## Methods

### Patients and treatment

Sixty-six children with ALL, included in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 58951 protocol, were enrolled in this study. The institutional review committee (CCPRB 95025, Bichat Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France) approved the study and informed consent from parents or guardians was collected for all children. According to the EORTC protocol, the patients were classified in risk groups depending on pre-therapeutic factors and response to the induction therapy (very low risk, average risk 1 (AR1), average risk 2 (AR2) and very high risk). Only patients in groups AR1 and AR2 were included in this study.

Maintenance therapy consisted of daily oral 6-MP (50 mg m^−2^) and weekly oral MTX (20 mg m^−2^) for 74 weeks. Medications were administered in the evening as recommended [[14](#b14)]. 6-MP doses were adjusted to maintain the white blood cell count between 2.0 and 3.0 × 10^9^ l^−1^. Triple intrathecal chemotherapy (MTX, aracytine and hydrocortisone) was given on maintenance day 22 and was repeated every 10 weeks for six times with a high-dose MTX course for AR2 patients. This study focused on the six cycles of 10 weeks because RBC 6-MP metabolite concentrations were monitored when patients were admitted to hospital before their triple intrathecal chemotherapy. Measurements were planned at 4 ± 1 weeks and 14, 24, 34, 44, 54 (±2) weeks of maintenance therapy but were only obtained when the patient had a medical visit to our hospital. Patients were included in the analysis if they had at least three determinations of RBC metabolite concentrations among these six potential measurements.

Interruptions of chemotherapy (number of weeks per cycle for each drug) and toxicity were reported at each cycle of treatment. The grading scale used for adverse event (AE) evaluation was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) version 2 [[15](#b15)]. This classification displays grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1, mild AE; Grade 2, moderate AE; Grade 3, severe AE; Grade 4, life-threatening or disabling AE and grade 5, death related to AE. The different grades of hepatotoxic events are presented in [Table 1](#tbl1).

### Sample collection and measurement of RBC 6-MP metabolites

Blood samples were collected in 2 ml EDTA tubes. Samples were kept cold in the dark until centrifugation at 4°C (2000 *g* for 5 min) to separate plasma and buffy coat from RBC. RBC were washed once with 2 ml of saline and packed by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 *g*. A 100 µl packed RBC sample was subsequently used to count RBC (Pentra 120 counter; Horiba) to express thiopurine metabolite concentrations in pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC. 6-TGN and 6-MMPN concentrations were measured in packed RBC by a previously described HPLC technique [[16](#b16)].

### Genotyping procedures

One blood sample (2 ml on EDTA) was collected to determine *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from blood samples using the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total genomic DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech, France) at 260 nm. ITPA polymorphisms (*ITPA 94 C* > *A*, rs41320251 and *ITPA IVS2*+*21 A* > *C*, rs7270101) and the three predominant TMPT polymorphisms (*TPMT***2* rs1800462, *TPMT***3B* rs1800460 and *TPMT***3C* rs1142345) were determined using a real-time TaqMan allelic discrimination method (ABI Prism 7700 SDS; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems.

### Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS® 15.0 (Windows, SPSS In*c*. 1989–2004, Chicago, Illinois, USA) and for genetic analysis using Thesias software (version 3.1). Six individual covariates were analyzed in this study: the risk group (AR1 or AR2), sex (boy or girl), age group (≤6 years or >6 years), *TPMT* genotype (wild-type or carrier of one of the three predominant *TPMT* variants: *TPMT***3B; TPMT***3C; TPMT***2*), the *ITPA 94 C* > *A* and *ITPA IVS2*+*21A* > *C* genotypes (wild-type or heterozygous). We selected the cut-off of 6 years as it has previously been used to study 6-MP in paediatric patients [[17](#b17)]. All covariates were tested two by two by Pearson Chi-square test to evaluate the repartition of one covariate among another covariate. Gaussian distribution of quantitative measures (total duration of 6-MP interruptions, individual 6-TGN and 6-MMPN concentrations and mean 6-TGN or 6-MMPN concentrations per patient) or ordinal parameters (total number of hepatotoxicities or infections) were tested by the Z-Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Depending on distribution of data, *t*-test or Mann–Whitney test were used to highlight differences between two independent groups for quantitative measures and correlations using Pearson or Spearman rank test for ordinal parameters. Statistical analysis for the kinetics of 6-MP metabolite concentrations was conducted using linear mixed models (one for 6-TGN concentrations and one for 6-MMPN concentrations) with SAS® software allowed the evaluation of the effect of individual covariates and the treatment time (cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) in the same analysis. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to predict toxic risk. The threshold of significance was fixed at 0.05.

Table 2 Caption: Demographic and treatment patients' characteristics

A total of 66 children, with ALL aged 6.8 ± 3.9 years (range 1.7 to 16.1 years) were included in this study. The majority were in the AR1 arm.

Individual *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes were determined for all patients except for one patient who had insufficient DNA for *ITPA* genotypes. No mutated homozygous genotype has been found for all the SNPs studied. For *TPMT*, six patients were heterozygous: four were *TPMT***1/***2*, one was *TPMT***1/***3A* and one was *TPMT***1/***3C*. For the different *ITPA* polymorphisms, mutated allelic frequencies were 0.07 and 0.13 for *ITPA 94 C* > *A* and *ITPA IVS2*+*21 A* > *C*, respectively, without linkage disequilibrium. Only one patient had one variant allele for both *ITPA* SNPs. Furthermore, 34/65 (52%) patients were wild-type homozygous for both *TPMT* and *ITPA* polymorphisms. One patient had one variant allele for both genes and the remaining were heterozygous either for *TPMT* polymorphism (*n* = 6/66) or for *ITPA* polymorphism (*n* = 25/65). Genetic allele frequencies for both polymorphisms were in accordance with frequencies reported in the ALL population and genotype distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [[18](#b18)].

Individual covariates were cross-tested two by two and no significant disequilibrium between groups was evidenced.

Interruptions of 6-MP and/or MTX treatments were reported throughout maintenance therapy for 64/66 patients (data were missing in two patients). Only seven (11%) patients completed treatment without any drug interruption, 16 (25%) patients had no 6-MP interruptions and 11 (17%) had no MTX interruptions. Mean duration of interruption per cycle was 1.6 ± 1.0 (0.4–6) weeks for 6-MP and 1.6 ± 0.9 (1–7) weeks for MTX and the total duration of interruption was 3.5 ± 2.9 (0.7–14) weeks for 6-MP and 4.5 ± 3.1 (1–16) weeks for MTX corresponding for both drugs at 2 ± 2 cycles affected. Impact of covariates was evaluated on the total duration of 6-MP treatment interruptions and a difference between *TPMT* groups was highlighted: patients heterozygous for *TPMT* had more treatment interruptions than wild-type patients (median total duration 4.0 *vs*. 1.5 weeks, *r* = 0.29, *P* = 0.024).

Drug toxicity was recorded at each cycle for all patients throughout maintenance therapy. Only one patient (1/66; 1.5%) reported no AEs, 19 (29%) had grade 1–2 AEs and the remaining 46 had grade 3–4 adverse effects. Occurrence of AEs (all types and grades included) were correlated with interruptions of treatment (as binary variable) for the first three treatment cycles (*r* = 0.31, 0.28 and 0.26, respectively, *P* < 0.05). The number and type of toxicities were similar between each treatment cycle and the most frequent AEs were hepatotoxicity and infection (45% and 27%, respectively). The number of these events per patient throughout treatment is presented in [Table 2](#tbl2). Infections were primarily grade 1–2 (only 4% were grade 3–4) and the number of infections was significantly higher in younger patients (<6 years) (median and range 2 (0–6) *vs*. 1 (0–4), respectively, *P* = 0.003). In contrast, hepatotoxic episodes were predominantly grade 3–4 (42%). Interestingly, 34 patients (52%) patients presented with four to six hepatotoxic episodes including 16 patients who developed hepatotoxicity at each cycle. None of the individual (non-genetic and genetic) covariates had an impact on the total number of hepatotoxicities.

### Effect of individual covariates on RBC 6-MP metabolite concentrations during 15 months of ALL maintenance therapy

During the six cycles of maintenance therapy, 327 RBC 6-MP metabolite concentrations were analyzed (at least three determinations per patient, with 30 (45%) patients having a maximum of six measurements). Results of mixed-models are presented in [Table 3](#tbl3). RBC 6-TGN and 6-MMPN concentrations reached steady-state at 4 ± 1 weeks with no difference in 6-MP metabolite concentrations between the different sampling time points. Gender, risk group and *ITPA IVS2*+*21 A > C* polymorphism had no influence on 6-MP metabolites concentrations.

The 6-TGN mixed model revealed the impact of age and *TPMT* genotype on 6-TGN concentrations ([Figure 1](#fig01)). Patients with a heterozygous *TPMT* genotype had 6-TGN concentrations 2.25 fold higher than wild-type patients. Furthermore, patients aged 6 years or younger had lower 6-TGN concentrations (82%) than patients older than 6 years. The combined effect of *TPMT* genotype and age could not be tested due to the small number of patients with a heterozygous *TPMT* and age >6 years (*n* = 3). The *ITPA 94 C > A* polymorphism had no influence on 6-TGN concentrations.

Similarly, the 6-MMPN mixed model revealed the impact of *TPMT* and *ITPA 94 C > A* genotypes on 6-MMPN concentrations. Patients with a wild-type *TPMT* genotype had 2.25 fold higher 6-MMPN concentrations than patients carrying a variant genotype. Moreover, patients heterozygous for the *ITPA 94 C > A* polymorphism had 2.1 fold higher 6-MMPN concentrations than wild-type patients. The combined effect of *TPMT* and *ITPA 94C > A* polymorphisms ([Figure 2](#fig02)) was analyzed on the mean 6-MMPN concentrations for each patient: the lowest 6-MMPN concentrations were observed in patients heterozygous for *TPMT* and wild-type for *ITPA 94 C > A* (mean 6-MMPN concentrations: 1862 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC) compared with wild-type patients for both genes who had 4.5 fold higher concentrations (8344 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC). The highest concentrations were reached for patients wild-type for *TPMT* and heterozygous for *ITPA 94 C > A* (16468 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC). Age had no influence on 6-MMPN concentrations.

### RBC 6-mercaptopurine metabolite concentrations and hepatotoxicity episodes

The influence of 6-MP metabolite concentrations on the occurrence of hepatotoxicity during 15 months of ALL maintenance therapy was evaluated. No significant relationship was identified between 6-TGN concentrations and hepatotoxicity. However, patients with episodes of hepatotoxicity had higher 6-MMPN concentrations than patients without hepatotoxicity ([Figure 3](#fig03), Panel A). Furthermore, the mean 6-MMPN concentrations, for patients without hepatotoxicity (*n* = 10, 15%) was 3795 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC, which was statistically different from 9807 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC for patients with hepatotoxicity (*n* = 56, 85%) ([Figure 3](#fig03), Panel B).

C) Specificity and sensibility curves of ROC analysis. Hepatotoxicity (); No hepatotoxicity ()

A predictive 6-MMPN concentration value of hepatotoxic risk was determined by ROC curve analysis. The area under the ROC curve was 0.82. The best sensitivity (80.4%) and specificity (80.0%) was defined for a 6-MMPN concentration threshold at 4884 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC ([Figure 3](#fig03), Panel C): 2/10 non hepatotoxic patients had 6-MMPN concentrations >4884 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC while 11/56 hepatotoxic patients had 6-MMPN concentrations <4884 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC. Therefore, the positive and negative predictive values of this threshold were 95.7% and 42.1%, respectively. In addition, hepatotoxic patients having a mean 6-MMPN concentration below the threshold (‘false negative patients’) had 4.5 ± 4.4 weeks of total 6-MP interruption during maintenance therapy while those with hepatotoxicity and 6-MMPN concentrations above the threshold had 2.3 ± 2.4 weeks (*P* = 0.035).

## Discussion

This study identified determinants of the high inter-individual variability of RBC 6-TGN and 6-MMPN metabolite concentrations during 6-MP and MTX maintenance therapy in childhood ALL. Our results show that in children 1) RBC 6-TGN concentrations are dependent on age and *TPMT* genotype, 2) RBC 6-MMPN concentrations are dependent on multilocus *TPMT* and *ITPA* 94 C > A genotypes and 3) high RBC 6-MMPN concentrations were associated with hepatotoxicity.

Individual *TPMT* genotype was determined in all patients as it is a major determinant of 6-MP intracellular equilibrium between pathways to 6-TGN and 6-MMPN. Therefore, the impact of individual covariates on 6-MP metabolite concentrations was adjusted for *TPMT* genotype and confirmed that inheritance of a variant allele explained part of the variability of RBC 6-MP metabolite concentrations. We also observed that patients carrying a heterozygous *TPMT* genotype had more interruptions of treatment with 6-MP than wild-type patients.

An age effect on RBC 6-TGN concentrations was demonstrated that has not previously been reported: 6-TGN concentrations at steady-state were lower in patients aged 6 years or less than in older patients, while treatment discontinuations were similar in both age groups. The reason for this age effect is unclear and probably not related to differences in TPMT activity, as it is reported not to be affected by age in children, from birth to adolescence [[19](#b19)]. One recent study in children with inflammatory bowel disease receiving 6-MP highlighted that patients 6 years and younger required higher doses to achieve clinical improvement [[17](#b17)]. The authors suggested that this might be related either to a reduced absorption or age-related differences in 6-MP metabolism associated with decreased formation of 6-TGN. Further investigations are warranted to determine if this difference in 6-MP metabolism between age groups is clinically relevant and if 6-MP dosage should be increased in younger children to obtain similar 6-TGN concentrations as in older patients. However the target concentration and therapeutic index for RBC 6-TGN during ALL maintenance therapy remains to be determined. The evaluation of efficacy might include measurements of 6-TGN incorporation into DNA [[5](#b5), [20](#b20)].

Furthermore, ITPA deficiency has been shown as a risk factor for 6-MP toxicity [[21](#b21)]. In our study, the *ITPA 94 C* > *A* genotype had an impact on RBC 6-MMPN concentrations. The variability of RBC 6-MMPN concentrations was explained by considering the multilocus *TPMT* and *ITPA 94 C* > *A* genotype: patients *TPMT* variant/ *ITPA* wild-type had the lowest 6-MMPN concentrations, patients wild-type for both polymorphisms had intermediate concentrations and those *TPMT* wild-type/ *ITPA* variant presented with the highest concentrations. The implication of *ITPA* polymorphism in the variability of RBC 6-MP metabolite concentrations was recently investigated, but only in small ALL groups. Hawwa *et al*. identified a potential impact of *ITPA IVS2*+*21A* > *C* on the mean RBC 6-TGN concentrations during the first 4 months of maintenance therapy but their population included only two heterozygous and one mutated homozygous compared with 17 wild-type patients. [[22](#b22)]. No impact of *ITPA 94 C* > *A* polymorphism was identified on 6-MP metabolites concentrations. Stocco and colleagues reported that patients carrying a multilocus *TPMT* variant/*ITPA 94 C* > *A* wild-type genotype had higher RBC 6-TGN concentrations compared with other groups but only four patients carried this genotype. [[18](#b18)] They also observed a significant combined effect of this multilocus *TPMT* and *ITPA 94 C* > *A* genotype on 6-MMPN concentrations. In the present study, we did not observe an impact of *ITPA* polymorphism on 6-TGN concentrations. This might be due to the lack of adjustment to *TPMT* genotype in Hawwa *et al*.'s study, which could have generated false positive results. However, our data support the involvement of *ITPA 94 C* > *A* polymorphism on 6-MMPN concentrations. It was reported that ITPA activity was nul in homozygous mutated patients and reduced to 25% of wild-type activity in heterozygous patients, a level of activity consistent with impaired assembly of a dimeric structure. The explanation of increased 6-MMPN concentrations is unclear, as it is only known that this reduced activity leads to the accumulation TITP, further methylated by TPMT and potentially leads to accumulation of 6-MMPN [[23](#b23)–[25](#b25)].

The monitoring of 6-MP metabolite concentrations is important not only to predict efficacy but also to improve tolerance. Hepatotoxicity and infection were the major adverse events accounting for 72% of all toxicities reported during maintenance therapy. In our population, age was the only covariate associated with the occurrence of infections, which were more frequent in younger patients. There was a strong association between 6-MMPN concentrations and the occurrence of hepatotoxicity. This relationship was already reported, as weighted means of aminotransferase concentrations were associated with RBC 6-MMPN concentrations in 43 children with ALL, while no association was detected with MTX plasma concentrations nor with intracellular MTX polyglutamates [[26](#b26)]. In the limited number of hepatotoxic patients presenting with 6-MMPN concentrations under the threshold, the role of co-administered drugs (such as MTX) or viral infections might explain the toxicity observed.

We determined that the 6-MMPN concentration threshold of 4884 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC was predictive for hepatotoxic risk with a 95.7% positive predictive value. Hepatotoxicity occurring with 6-MMPN concentrations under the threshold may be explained by 6-MP dosage reductions or interruptions, as the total duration of 6-MP interruptions was higher in patients with low 6-MMPN concentrations than in patients with 6-MMPN concentrations above the threshold. Although it remains important to confirm our results, such threshold of 5000 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC 6-MMPN will allow dosage adjustment to limit hepatotoxicity. A target threshold of 5700 pmol/8 × 10^8^ RBC was identified in patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease. Even if ALL or inflammatory disease, in the context of treatment and co-medications are different, the two threshold values are close, making the data even more reliable. As MTX was reported to be more hepatotoxic than 6-MP, it is usually the first drug to be adjusted and even discontinued when a hepatotoxic event occurs. Thus, such a threshold will also avoid individual changes of MTX dosage, usually performed in such situations [[27](#b27)].

In conclusion, determination of *TPMT* genotype before treatment allows the identification of homozygote deficient patients at high risk of severe and life-threatening toxicity. In addition to white blood cell count, intracellular 6-MP metabolites will become useful markers to monitor 6-MP during ALL maintenance therapy [[28](#b28)]. Individual demographic and pharmacogenetic markers linked to pharmacokinetics will allow the individualization of drug administration and improve the outcome of paediatric patients with ALL. In the future, a multi gene-based approach might provide a more complete assessment of genetic differences implicated in the variability of treatment response and help to improve survival rates in children with ALL.
