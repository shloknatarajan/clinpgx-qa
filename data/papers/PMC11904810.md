## Abstract

**Background:** 
Clopidogrel response varies significantly among individuals due to multiple influencing factors. This study aimed to investigate the associations between P2RY12 gene variants, non‐genetic factors, and platelet aggregation in patients undergoing clopidogrel therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention.

**Methods:** 
We conducted a cross‐sectional descriptive study involving 171 patients who successfully underwent coronary artery stenting and were treated with clopidogrel at two military hospitals in Vietnam. Platelet aggregation was assessed using the light transmission aggregometry (LTA) method, with clopidogrel resistance (CR) defined as maximal platelet aggregation > 50%. P2RY12 genetic polymorphisms (C34T‐rs6785930 and G52T‐rs6809699) were genotyped using Sanger sequencing.

**Results:** 
The allele frequencies were 74.56% (C) and 25.44% (T) for P2RY12 C34T, and 88.30% (G) and 11.70% (T) for P2RY12 G52T. Platelet aggregation progressively increased across the GG, GT, and TT genotypes of P2RY12 G52T (p = 0.03), with patients carrying the TT genotype exhibiting significantly higher platelet aggregation compared to other genotypes (p = 0.01). Among non‐genetic factors, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) intake was associated with a significant increase in platelet aggregation (p = 0.03). The prevalence of clopidogrel resistance (CR) was 43.86%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the T allele of P2RY12 C34T, reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and PPI intake as significant risk factors for CR (OR = 2.24, 2.49, 4.01; p = 0.02, 0.049, 0.01, respectively).

**Conclusions:** 
The T allele of P2RY12 C34T was associated with an increased risk of CR. Among non‐genetic factors, PPI intake significantly elevated platelet aggregation and, along with reduced eGFR, contributed to a higher risk of CR.

### Background

Clopidogrel response varies significantly among individuals due to multiple influencing factors. This study aimed to investigate the associations between *P2RY12* gene variants, non‐genetic factors, and platelet aggregation in patients undergoing clopidogrel therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Methods

We conducted a cross‐sectional descriptive study involving 171 patients who successfully underwent coronary artery stenting and were treated with clopidogrel at two military hospitals in Vietnam. Platelet aggregation was assessed using the light transmission aggregometry (LTA) method, with clopidogrel resistance (CR) defined as maximal platelet aggregation > 50%. *P2RY12* genetic polymorphisms (C34T‐rs6785930 and G52T‐rs6809699) were genotyped using Sanger sequencing.

### Results

The allele frequencies were 74.56% (*C*) and 25.44% (*T*) for *P2RY12* C34T, and 88.30% (*G*) and 11.70% (*T*) for *P2RY12* G52T. Platelet aggregation progressively increased across the *GG*, *GT*, and *TT* genotypes of *P2RY12 G52T* (*p* = 0.03), with patients carrying the *TT* genotype exhibiting significantly higher platelet aggregation compared to other genotypes (*p* = 0.01). Among non‐genetic factors, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) intake was associated with a significant increase in platelet aggregation (*p* = 0.03). The prevalence of clopidogrel resistance (CR) was 43.86%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the *T* allele of *P2RY12 C34T*, reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and PPI intake as significant risk factors for CR (OR = 2.24, 2.49, 4.01; *p* = 0.02, 0.049, 0.01, respectively).

### Conclusions

The T allele of *P2RY12* C34T was associated with an increased risk of CR. Among non‐genetic factors, PPI intake significantly elevated platelet aggregation and, along with reduced eGFR, contributed to a higher risk of CR.

## 1. Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally, including in Vietnam. This disease is primarily associated with two clinical conditions: acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and foundational antiplatelet therapy provide significant benefits to patients. According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, antiplatelet therapy in patients after PCI is crucial and needs to be optimized and individualized [[1](#jcla70003-bib-0001)]. Dual antiplatelet therapy, comprising aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, has become the cornerstone of treatment. Currently, various antiplatelet medications that inhibit P2Y12 receptors are in use, each with its advantages and limitations. Guidelines provide recommendations for selecting and switching between these medications to optimize patient outcomes. The use of novel P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, such as ticagrelor and prasugrel, is associated with higher treatment costs and an increased risk of bleeding [[2](#jcla70003-bib-0002), [3](#jcla70003-bib-0003), [4](#jcla70003-bib-0004)]. Notably, growing evidence highlights the “East Asian Paradox,” where East Asians exhibit a lower incidence of atherothrombotic events but a higher risk of major bleeding following antithrombotic therapy compared to Caucasians [[5](#jcla70003-bib-0005)], [[6](#jcla70003-bib-0006)]. Therefore, clopidogrel remains a widely used and cost‐effective option in Vietnam.

Despite the benefits of antiplatelet therapy, resistance to these agents can lead to severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and stent restenosis, and in some cases, even death. Clopidogrel resistance (CR) is particularly common, especially among Asian patients [[7](#jcla70003-bib-0007)]. The underlying mechanisms of CR are not fully understood and appear to be multifactorial, involving a combination of genetic and non‐genetic factors [[8](#jcla70003-bib-0008)].

The ADP receptor P2Y12, a pharmacological target of clopidogrel, is encoded by the *P2RY12* gene. Clopidogrel's active thiol selectively and irreversibly inhibits P2Y12 receptors on platelet surfaces, thereby blocking ADP‐induced platelet activation and preventing platelet aggregation [[9](#jcla70003-bib-0009)]. Variants of the *P2RY12* gene can alter how the protein interacts with its natural agonist ADP, potentially disrupting the signaling cascade, or with pharmaceutical P2Y12 antagonists [[10](#jcla70003-bib-0010)]. Evidence suggests that single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as *G52T* and *C34T* are associated with clopidogrel response and cardiovascular adverse events [[8](#jcla70003-bib-0008), [11](#jcla70003-bib-0011), [12](#jcla70003-bib-0012)].

Although studies have suggested that genetic polymorphisms may influence CR, the available genetic variation data are insufficient to fully explain the variability in clopidogrel responsiveness. Non‐genetic factors, such as demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and drug–drug interactions, have also been linked to CR [[13](#jcla70003-bib-0013)]. These genetic and non‐genetic factors vary significantly across populations due to differences in genetic backgrounds, social conditions, and environmental factors. However, there is limited information regarding the *P2RY12* gene variants, particularly the *C34T* and *G52T* variants, non‐genetic factors, and their impact on clopidogrel responsiveness in Vietnamese patients. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the associations of *P2RY12* gene variants and non‐genetic factors with clopidogrel responsiveness in Vietnamese patients following PCI.

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1. Patients

We selected all adult patients (aged 18 years or older) who were admitted to hospital for CAD from September 2021 to December 2022 at the 103 Military Hospital and the 175 Military Hospital with inclusion criteria included diagnosed with ACS according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction 2018 or CCS according to the ESC guidelines 2019 [[14](#jcla70003-bib-0014), [15](#jcla70003-bib-0015)]. Eligible patients had successfully underwent coronary stenting, as guided by the ESC 2021 [[16](#jcla70003-bib-0016)], and were treated with clopidogrel. All participants had been on continuous clopidogrel therapy (75 mg/day) for more than 7 days. The exclusion criteria included prior use of ticagrelor, prasugrel, oral anticoagulants, or omeprazole within the previous 7 days; severe anemia or thrombocytopenia; a history of bleeding disorders; severe liver failure; Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD); severe infectious diseases; and malignancies.

The equation for sample size calculation was as follows [[17](#jcla70003-bib-0017)]: N=Z1−α/22p1−pd2, where N is the sample size, *Z* _1‐α/2_ (standard normal variate at 5% Type 1 error) = 1.96, *p* (expected proportion of CR based on a pilot study by Guha [[18](#jcla70003-bib-0018)]) = 0.125, and *d* (absolute error) = 0.05. The required sample size was 169. Finally, this study sample comprised 171 adults with CAD who met the criteria for analysis.

All study participants were Vietnamese and were informed in detail about the study, providing written informed consent. The methods used in this study were performed following relevant clinical guidelines and experimental protocols. The Ethics Committee of the 175 Military Hospital reviewed and approved all clinical procedures according to Decision Number 3045/QĐ‐HĐĐĐ‐2021.02.

### 2.2. Study Procedure

All patients underwent a comprehensive assessment. Upon admission, demographic parameters and comorbidities, including sex, age, current smoking status, body mass index, and history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, were collected from the patient's medical records. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, and prescribed medications were also documented. Cardiovascular specialists carried out coronary artery angiography (CAG) procedures and performed PCI using a drug‐eluting stent (DES) if the patient had a lesion with more than 70% stenosis of the vessel. Stent implantation was considered successful if residual obstruction was less than 20% and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade III flow was achieved. The features of the PCI procedure were recorded. Following the procedure, patients were administered 75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin daily, unless contraindicated. Whole‐blood samples (5 mL) were collected on the 7th day after the first administration of the first clopidogrel dose to measure ADP‐induced platelet aggregation. Blood samples were also taken on the day of hospitalization for genotyping and biochemical testing.

Overweight‐obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 23 kg/m^2^ according to the WHO Asia‐Pacific criteria [[19](#jcla70003-bib-0019)]. The decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined by measuring baseline serum creatinine levels on the first day of admission. The eGFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula [[20](#jcla70003-bib-0020)]: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2^) = 175 × S_Cr_ ^−1.154^ × age^−0.203^ × 0.742 (if female). Patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2^ were considered to have a decreased eGFR following the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines [[21](#jcla70003-bib-0021)].

### 2.3. Determination of Platelet Aggregation

Platelet aggregation was measured using the light transmission aggregometry (LTA) method with ADP (5 μmol/L) as the specific stimulant [[22](#jcla70003-bib-0022)]. The test was conducted using a standardized procedure at the Department of Hematology, at the 103 Military Hospital and the Department of Hematology at the 175 Military Hospital. The tests were carried out after at least 7 days of clopidogrel use. CR criteria were determined when maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) exceeded 50% [[23](#jcla70003-bib-0023)]. Based on the results of platelet aggregation testing, the patients were divided into two groups: CR and non‐CR.

### 2.4. Determination of P2RY12 Genetic Polymorphisms

DNA was extracted using the GeneJET Whole Blood Genomic DNA Purification Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR products were prepared with primer sequences designed using the online software Primer‐BLAST (NCBI) and synthesized by Phu Sa Genomics Company. The forward primer (primer F) sequence was 5′‐TTG AAA GAA AAT CCT CAT CGC CAG‐3′, and the reverse primer (Primer R) sequence was 5′‐CTC AAC TTT TAG AGG AGG CTG TG‐3′. The reaction mixture consisted of 20 μL of master mix, 1.5 μL of Primer F, 1.5 μL of Primer R, 2 μL of DNA, and 15 μL of water (total volume: 40 μL). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 25 s; followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR product, which was 274 bp in length, was electrophoresed and purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing was then performed using an ABI 3500 at the Institute of Biomedicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam Military Medical University (VMMU). The electropherograms of the Sanger sequencing results for the *P2RY12 C34T* and *P2RY12*

*G52T* genotypes are presented in Figures [S1](#jcla70003-supitem-0001) and [S2](#jcla70003-supitem-0001), respectively.

### 2.5. Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0. Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (X ± SD), and qualitative variables were presented as percentages. A *t*‐test (for comparing two groups) and one‐way ANOVA (for comparing more than two groups) were used to compare the mean values of normally distributed quantitative variables. For non‐normally distributed variables, the Mann–Whitney *U*‐test (for comparing two groups) was applied. Differences between the two qualitative variables were analyzed using the chi‐square and Fisher's exact tests (when the observed value was less than 5). The baseline characteristics were compared between patients with the normal genotype and those with the variant allele. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to compare the CR group and the non‐CR group to find the relationships of genetic and non‐genetic factors with CR. A *p*‐value less than 0.05 (two‐tailed) was considered statistically significant. The study diagram is shown in Figure [1](#jcla70003-fig-0001).

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Baseline Features in Different P2RY12 Genetic Polymorphism Groups

A total of 171 eligible CAD patients who received PCI and clopidogrel therapy were enrolled in this study between September 2021 and December 2022. Patient demographic, clinical, and biochemical information, along with characteristics of coronary artery disease and interventions, are summarized in Table [1](#jcla70003-tbl-0001). Patients with the wild‐type genotype (*CC* genotype of *P2RY12 C34T* or *GG* genotype of *P2RY12 G52T*) were compared to those with the *T* variant, either in the heterozygote or homozygote form. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of age, risk factors, type of CAD, renal function, characteristics of coronary artery lesions, stents implanted during the PCI procedure, or medications used between the groups classified by *P2RY12* genetic polymorphisms.

### 3.2. P2RY12 Genetic Polymorphism Characteristics

The *P2RY12* genotype frequencies are presented in Table [2](#jcla70003-tbl-0002). Analysis of the *P2RY12* gene revealed that the majority of patients had the *CC* genotype of C34T (57.31%) and the *GG* genotype of G52T (78.95%). For C34T, the *C* and *T* allele frequencies were 74.56% and 25.44%, respectively; for G52T, the *G* and *T* allele frequencies were 88.30% and 11.70%, respectively. Both polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

### 3.3. Associations of P2RY12 Genetic Polymorphisms and Non‐Genetic Factors With Platelet Aggregation

The relationships between *P2RY12* polymorphisms, non‐genetic factors, and platelet aggregation are shown in Table [3](#jcla70003-tbl-0003). Platelet aggregation progressively increased when comparing the *CC, GT*, and *TT* genotypes of *P2RY12* G52T (45.77%, 48.75%, and 65.10%, respectively; *p* = 0.03). Similarly, when comparing the recessive model (*GT + TT* vs. *TT* genotype) of *P2RY12* G52T, a similar trend was observed (46.34% vs. 65.10%, respectively; *p* = 0.01). Regarding non‐genetic factors, platelet aggregation was higher in the group of patients treated with PPIs compared to those not treated with PPIs (47.82% vs. 40.68%, respectively; *p* = 0.03) (Table [3](#jcla70003-tbl-0003)).

### 3.4. Associations of P2RY12 Genetic Polymorphisms and Non‐Genetic Factors With CR

The patients were divided into two groups based on the results of the light transmission aggregometry (LTA): clopidogrel resistance (CR, MPA > 50%) and non‐CR (MPA ≤ 50%) [[22](#jcla70003-bib-0022)], [[23](#jcla70003-bib-0023)]. Among these patients, 75 patients (43.86%) were categorized as CR, and 96 patients (56.14%) as non‐CR (Table [4](#jcla70003-tbl-0004)). The associations between *P2RY12* genetic polymorphisms, non‐genetic factors, and CR as determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses are shown in Table [4](#jcla70003-tbl-0004). In the univariate analysis, the risk of CR was significantly increased by *T* variant of C34T (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.06–3.66, *p* = 0.03), overweight–obesity (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.03–3.51, *p* = 0.04), decreased GFR (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.14–5.37, *p* = 0.02), and PPI intake (OR: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.31–10.34, *p* = 0.01). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients with the *T* variant of C34T had a significantly higher risk of CR than patients with the *CC* genotype (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14–4.41, *p* = 0.02). Additionally, patients with decreased GFR or those with PPI intake also had a significantly higher risk of CR (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.003–6.18, *p* = 0.049; OR: 4.01, 95% CI: 1.34–11.97, *p* = 0.01, respectively). These associations were independent of age, sex, BMI, hypertension status, diabetes status, or dyslipidemia status (Table [4](#jcla70003-tbl-0004)).

## 4. Discussion

Antiplatelet therapy, with clopidogrel being a widely used choice both globally and in Vietnam, is considered the cornerstone in the treatment of coronary artery disease [[24](#jcla70003-bib-0024)]. Clopidogrel is commonly used in both single and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), especially for patients undergoing PCI. However, recent studies have shown that CR increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in Asian patients, with reported rates ranging from 17.2% to 81.6%, and approximately 4%–30% of patients post‐PCI experiencing CR [[7](#jcla70003-bib-0007)]. Various methods are available to determine platelet aggregation, but in this study, we used the light transmission aggregometry (LTA) method, which is considered the “gold standard” for evaluating platelet aggregation [[25](#jcla70003-bib-0025)]. Our results, which involved measuring platelet aggregation in 171 consecutive Vietnamese patients undergoing PCI after at least 7 days of clopidogrel treatment, indicated that 43.86% of them exhibited CR. This finding is consistent with reports from other studies on Asian populations.

Several studies have shown an association between *CYP2C19* gene polymorphisms and CR, as clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires bioactivation before it can inhibit platelet aggregation through the P2Y12 receptor. However, *CYP2C19* gene polymorphisms account for only approximately 12% of CR cases [[8](#jcla70003-bib-0008)]. This suggests that CR is influenced not only by drug metabolism but also by genetic polymorphisms affecting drug bioactivation, such as those in the *P2RY12* gene. In the *P2RY12* gene, there are at least two exons, divided by a single intron. Within this intron, a polymorphism designated as T744C was identified. Additionally, another polymorphism was detected in exon 2, involving a C to T transition (C34T) at the nucleotide position 34 and a G to T transversion (G52T) at nucleotide position 52 [[26](#jcla70003-bib-0026)]. In this study, we first examined the frequency of the *P2RY12* C34T and G52T variants in Vietnamese patients. We found that the allele frequencies of these variants are similar to those reported in Li Miaonan's study on patients with ACS [[8](#jcla70003-bib-0008)] and Hidayat's research on Indonesian patients [[26](#jcla70003-bib-0026)]. According to a meta‐analysis of Cui et al., individuals with either homozygous or heterozygous genotypes of the *G52T* polymorphism exhibited a notably higher resistance to clopidogrel compared to those with the wild‐type homozygous genotype (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.14–1.85, *p* = 0.003). The *C34T* polymorphism was also significantly associated with CR (*p* = 0.002). However, the *T744C* polymorphism did not show a significant correlation with CR (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.58–1.33, *p* = 0.54) [[11](#jcla70003-bib-0011)]. Therefore, this study focused on the *C34T* and *G52T* polymorphisms.

Our study revealed that the *T* allele of *P2RY12* G52T significantly impacted platelet aggregation, especially the *TT* genotype. Additionally, patients with the *TT* or *CT* genotype of *P2RY12* C34T showed higher platelet aggregation than those with the CC genotype, although the difference was not statistically significant. One possible explanation for this result is that these gene polymorphisms affect the binding of clopidogrel to the P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent signaling pathway activation. Another potential mechanism is that gene polymorphisms may result in variant receptor expression, altering drug efficacy by changing drug‐receptor binding affinity [[27](#jcla70003-bib-0027)]. This result was similar to what Cui et al. found: individuals carrying either the homozygous or heterozygous (*TT + GT*) genotype of G52T exhibited an increased risk of resistance to clopidogrel compared to those with the wild‐type genotype [[11](#jcla70003-bib-0011)]. This study was in line with the results of Miaonan et al. that *G52T* variation in the P2Y12 receptor gene may pose a risk for inadequate platelet response in patients undergoing clopidogrel therapy [[8](#jcla70003-bib-0008)]. However, when compared with the study by Hidayat et al., we observed contradictory findings as they reported no significant correlation between clopidogrel resistance and the *G52T* polymorphism in the P2Y12 gene (*p* > 0.05) [[26](#jcla70003-bib-0026)].

Our study also demonstrated that patients with the *T* allele of *P2RY12 C34T* had a significantly higher risk of CR than those with the *CC* genotype. This finding was similar to a previous study showing that the presence of the *T* allele at *C34T* doubles the risk of CR [[11](#jcla70003-bib-0011)]. Similarly, Li Miaonan's research on *P2RY12* receptor polymorphisms and platelet responses to clopidogrel found that the *P2RY12 C34T* polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of CR and subsequent cardiovascular events in Chinese ACS patients post‐PCI [[8](#jcla70003-bib-0008)]. The findings align with the results from two meta‐analyses conducted by Cui et al. and Zhao et al., which also highlighted a significant association between the *T* allele of the *C34T* polymorphism and an increased risk of suboptimal response to clopidogrel [[11](#jcla70003-bib-0011), [12](#jcla70003-bib-0012)]. In European populations, reports on the T allele of the *P2RY12 C34T* are scarce. A study found no association between this T allele and CR in patients with myocardial infarction [[28](#jcla70003-bib-0028)]. Similarly, other studies also revealed no significant correlation between CR and the *G52T* and *C34T* genes of *P2RY12* [[26](#jcla70003-bib-0026), [29](#jcla70003-bib-0029)]. These conflicting results highlight the complexity of genetic contributions to CR. Therefore, exploring the complementary connections between *P2RY12* gene polymorphisms and metabolism‐related gene polymorphisms such as *CYP2C19* is vital to further understanding the mechanism of clopidogrel resistance.

Regarding non‐genetic factors, our findings showed that overweight or obesity status increased the risk of CR. Potential explanations for the elevated risk of thrombosis in obese individuals might include modified protein profiles of fibrinolytic and coagulation cascades coupled with elevated platelet reactivity. Elevated levels of platelet activation indicators, including the mean platelet volume, thromboxane B2 metabolites, circulating levels of platelet microparticles, soluble *p*‐selectin, and platelet‐generated CD40L, indicate a shift in platelet function associated with obesity [[30](#jcla70003-bib-0030)]. Additionally, some studies have demonstrated a link between adipokines and platelet signaling, leading to enhanced platelet aggregation. Adipokines, particularly leptin, are bioactive peptides released by adipose tissue that regulate metabolism, body weight, and vessel function [[31](#jcla70003-bib-0031)]. Platelets possess leptin receptors on their surface, and elevated leptin levels in the blood can enhance platelet aggregation [[32](#jcla70003-bib-0032)].

We found that reduced renal function was related to an increased risk of CR. This finding aligns with previous studies using variety of platelet function tests. For instance, using LTA in diabetic patients receiving maintenance DAPT for a minimum of 30 days, Angiolillo demonstrated a link between CR and reduced renal function [[33](#jcla70003-bib-0033)]. Similarly, Zhang's study identified reduced eGFR as an independent risk factor for CR [[34](#jcla70003-bib-0034)]. Research by Qing Li on ACS patients treated with clopidogrel revealed that renal dysfunction was associated with residual platelet reactivity and a high risk of 1‐year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) [[35](#jcla70003-bib-0035)]. Therefore, patients with low eGFR should be followed up on for standardized therapy and regular follow‐up to lower their risk of CR.

Our study also revealed that using PPIs was associated with increased platelet aggregation and the risk of CR. The reduction in clopidogrel's antiplatelet effect by using PPIs could lead to significant long‐term cardiovascular complications. A study by Juurlink et al. found that patients who used PPIs alongside clopidogrel after a myocardial infarction had a 40% higher risk of experiencing a recurrent myocardial infarction within 90 days of being discharged from the hospital [[36](#jcla70003-bib-0036)]. Studies published between 2012 and 2016 also reported a significant association between PPI use and increased adverse cardiac events, including ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), after PCI [[7](#jcla70003-bib-0007)]. PPIs are known to influence the response to clopidogrel and the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel was reduced when a PPI was used concurrently [[37](#jcla70003-bib-0037)]. Recent data indicated that certain PPIs might competitively inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19, which may change the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and increase the risk of adverse cardiac events. Among PPIs, omeprazole is identified as a stronger inhibitor of CYP2C19 compared to others in the class, prompting the FDA to issue a warning about its interaction with clopidogrel [[7](#jcla70003-bib-0007), [38](#jcla70003-bib-0038)]. Therefore, our study excluded patients who used omeprazole in treatment. The COGENT was the only large randomized controlled trial investigating individuals treated with DAPT and PPIs. Smaller RCTs, other meta‐analyses, and observational studies have all shown contradictory data about the effectiveness of PPIs [[36](#jcla70003-bib-0036)]. Therefore, the use of PPIs in patients undergoing PCI and treated with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel remains a subject of debate. Current American clinical guidelines generally advocate for conservative management, suggesting the co‐prescription of PPIs with DAPT exclusively for patients at high risk of bleeding [[36](#jcla70003-bib-0036)]. Clinicians must carefully assess the bleeding risk and adhere to current guidelines to balance the benefits and risks of CR, especially for Asian patients who may have a greater prevalence of *CYP2C19* loss‐of‐function polymorphisms.

Based on these findings, we recommend that it is crucial for post‐PCI patients experiencing risk of CR or adverse cardiovascular events related to ischemia during clopidogrel therapy follow‐up to undergo *P2RY12* gene polymorphism testing. Identifying *P2RY12* variation alleles could guide the adjustment of their antiplatelet treatment regimen to a more suitable alternative. In addition, in order to individualize antiplatelet therapy in patients with high BMI, reduced eGFR, or a need for PPI therapy, it is crucial to consider switching to an alternative DAPT regimen to mitigate the risk of CR.

Although our study reveals some important results, it has several limitations. First, platelet function was assessed at a single time point, which may not fully capture the response to antiplatelet treatment, although all patients had been on clopidogrel for at least 7 days. Second, serum creatinine levels were measured only at admission, even though decreased eGFR in some patients could be influenced by various factors over time. Third, the sample size was relatively small, with only four patients carrying the *TT* genotype of *P2RY12 G52T* included in the study. The limited number of participants with this specific genotype restricts the statistical power and generalizability of our findings related to its impact on clopidogrel responsiveness. Lastly, this study did not follow‐up on the effects of these alleles on long‐term cardiovascular outcomes. Future studies with larger cohorts and extended follow‐up are essential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of these factors.

## 5. Conclusion

Our study of Vietnamese patients following PCI revealed a CR rate of 43.68%. The *T* allele of *P2RY12* C34T was associated with an increased risk of CR. Among non‐genetic factors, PPI use significantly enhanced platelet aggregation. Additionally, PPI use and reduced eGFR were both identified as contributors to an elevated risk of CR.
