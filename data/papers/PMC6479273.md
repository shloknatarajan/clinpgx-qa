## Abstract

Warfarin continues to be the mainstay therapy for preventing thrombus formation. Although pharmacogenetic algorithms have shown higher predictability of the optimal warfarin dose and lower occurrence of bleeding episodes, they often do not include ethno-specific genetic variants relevant to non-Europeans. This case report describes a rare missense variant at exon 9 of CYP2C9 (rs202201137; c.1370A>G transition; p.Asn457Ser) found in a Puerto Rican patient with low warfarin dose requirements (3 mg/day). The haplotype characterized by two amino acid changes, Asn457Ser and Arg144Cys (rs1799853; c.430C>T), has been designated CYP2C9*61 by the Pharmacogene Variation Consortium. According to prediction scores assessed with the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion tool, CYP2C9*61 (p.Asn457Ser) was classified as nondeleterious, therefore its impact on CYP2C9 enzymatic activity cannot be postulated.

## Case

A 78-year-old, self-identified Black Puerto Rican male (height: 167 cm; weight: 92 kg) with a past medical history of status-post aortobifemoral bypass surgery, dyslipidemia and major depression was recruited to participate in a clinical study on warfarin pharmacogenetics (participant ID: WPRA006). The patient had a history of nonsmoking and nonalcohol consumption. Hepatic enzymes as well as hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum creatinine (mg/dl) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were all within normal range. At the time of enrollment, the patient was taking warfarin, amitriptyline and gemfibrozil, with evidence of compliance on these treatments. The patient denied any report of adverse episodes at the time of recruitment. The cardiac examination was unrevealing. His laboratory tests revealed an INR of 2.73 on reported therapeutic dose (i.e., prescribed warfarin at a dose of 3 mg/day, *per os*, for prevention of thrombus formation). It took 111 days, however, to reach a target INR of 2–3.

Based on the diagnosis of status-post aortobifemoral bypass surgery, the INR therapeutic range is between 2.0 and 3.0, however, the baseline INR value for this patient was lower at 1.86. Warfarin dosage was changed three-times for this patient during the course of the 111-day adjustment period. A total of 17 INR tests were ordered before the patient reached his INR target. Seven INR measurements exceeded target level peaking at 7.4 suggesting a supratherapeutic level of warfarin dosage, and exposing him to a higher risk of bleeding, and three measurements were below the target. No major life-threatening bleeding episodes were reported and dosage was eventually stabilized at 3 mg/day, the lowest dose prescribed, at the time of achievement of the target INR. In this patient, the initial warfarin dose of 5 mg/day resulted in INRs that exceeded the target range. At the initiation of therapy, the dose was the highest dose given to the patient.

After obtaining written informed consent, this patient underwent genotype testing as a participant in the research study conducted at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System anticoagulation clinic to investigate the association of common minor alleles in *CYP2C9, CYP4F2, NQO1* and *VKORC1* pharmacogenes with warfarin-dosing requirements in the Puerto Rican population. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus (IRB protocol: A4070109) and the VA Caribbean Healthcare System (IRB protocol: 00558). DNA testing to infer metabolic capacity and sensitivity to warfarin revealed that this patient is a carrier of three major variant alleles that have previously been associated with warfarin response, in other words, *CYP2C9*2/*5* and *CYP4F2*1/*3*. In addition, we discovered the *CYP2C9* exon 9 variant rs202201137. Noteworthy, this patient is not a carrier of *VKORC1*-1639 G>A, a major genetic predictor of warfarin dosing, or the *NQO1*2* (4559C>T) allele that has also been implicated to contribute to warfarin dose requirements.

The variant *CYP2C9* rs202201137 (10:96748682; c.1370A>G; p.Asn457Ser) was first identified by performing targeted resequencing of the *CYP2C9* gene using the Ion PGM sequencing system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) as previously published by our group [[15](#B15)] and confirmed with Sanger sequencing ([Figure 1](#F0001)). Variants identified with the Ion PGM sequencing were phased using Beagle v4.1 [[16](#B16)] to estimate the haplotypic arrangements of *CYP2C9*. According to Beagle estimates, this rare variant was in linkage disequilibrium with *CYP2C9*2* and rs2860905, both previously found associated with low warfarin dose requirements in Puerto Ricans [[15](#B15)] but not with *CYP2C9*5*. Moreover, these results were verified with data from 1000 Genomes Project and accordingly, none of the Puerto Rican individuals with the variant *CYP2C9* rs202201137 (samples HG01190 and HG01325) were carriers of *CYP2C9*5* (sample HG01170) confirming their independent inheritance predicted by Beagle. The novel haplotype containing rs202201137 ([Figure 2](#F0002)) was submitted to the Pharmacogene Variation Consortium ([www.PharmVar.org](http://www.PharmVar.org)) [[17](#B17)] and designated as *CYP2C9*61*.

### Figure 1. . The presence of CYP2C9 rs202201137 (10:96748682; c.1370 A>G; p. Asn457Ser) in exon 9 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (highlighted in blue).

This novel haplotype carries a series of SNPs including the SNP defining the CYP2C9*2 allele, in other words, c.430C>T (rs1799853; Arg144Cys) as well as a number of 5′ upstream and intronic SNPs, in other words, c.-3597A>G (rs61886768), c.-3360T>C (rs61886769), c.-1188T>C (rs4918758), c.-1096A>G (rs4917636) and c.481+197G>A (rs2860905). Positions are provided according to the NM_000771.3 cDNA reference sequence.

### Functional prediction of p.Asn457Ser defining the CYP2C9*61 haplotype

*CYP2C9*61* was evaluated using the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion tool (CADD v1.3 at [http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/info](http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/info)). Predicted scores for potential deleteriousness are summarized in [Table 1](#T1). Grantham, SIFT and PolyP scores provide information regarding the effects of amino acids substitutions and predict deleteriousness based on protein structure and function. These scores suggest that *CYP2C9*61* is tolerated and benign. On the other hand, GERP, PhastCons and PhyloP provide information regarding the conservation of the locus where this variant is mapped to. Based on the neutral evolution hypothesis, these conservation scores indicate that this variant site is not under evolutionary constraint and, therefore, is not highly conserved [[18](#B18)].

### Table 1. . Combined annotation depletion scores for predicted functionality and conservation of CYP2C9*61.

| Variant | C-score (PHRED-like)† | Amino acid substitution scores |  |  | Conservation scores |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Grantham‡ | SIFT§ | Polyphen¶ | GERP# | PriPhastCons†† | PriPhyloP‡‡ |   |   |
| CYP2C9*61 (Asn457Ser) | 0.001 | 46 | 0.830 (tolerated) | 0.009 (benign) | 2.30 | 0.014 | 0.368 |
|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| CYP2C9*8 (Arg150His) | 7.882 | 29 | 0.330 (tolerated) | 0.005 (benign) | 3.54 | 0.553 | -0.450 |

Table 1 Caption: †C-score is a PHRED-like CADD ranking system that estimates the probability that the variant is deleterious. This score allows prioritizing variants with the highest predicted deleteriousness. This value depends on the dataset. ‡Grantham score categorizes amino acids substitutions based on chemical dissimilarity where higher scores reflect higher evolutionary distance and are expected to be more deleterious. §SIFT predicts deleteriousness based on the protein structure and function (scores range from 0 to 1 where 0 predicts a higher chance of being damaging). ¶PolyPhen is the probability that the substitution is damaging (scores from 0 to 1 where values closer to 1 predicts deleteriousness). #GERP observes the number of substitutions expected under neutrality minus the number of observed substitutions (in a multiple sequence alignment); therefore, positives scores (fewer than expected) indicate that a site is under evolutionary constraint; values range from -12.3 to 6.17, where values closer to 6.17 indicate conservation. ††PhastCons values in primates (Pri-PhastCons) are a ratio that represents the average rate of substitutions in conserved regions relative to the average rate in nonconserved regions; scores in closer to 0 indicate less conservation. ‡‡PhyloP values in primates (Pri-PhyloP); PhyloP compares the probability of observed substitutions under the hypothesis of neutral evolutionary rate; positive values indicate conservation and negatives indicate selection.

However, these scores do not necessarily rule out an impact on activity. As a way of example, rs7900194 (c.449G>A, p.Arg150His) defining the *CYP2C9*8* allele in exon 3 was also predicted as tolerated and benign (see [Table 1](#T1)). In addition, it is not located in a highly conserved region (according to conservation scores), but this functional variant has been found to be significantly associated with low warfarin dose requirements in individuals of African ancestry (e.g., African–Americans and Puerto Ricans) [[12](#B12),[19](#B19)]. In fact, this missense variant is listed by ClinVar as a drug-response allele based on sustained evidence linking this SNP with warfarin response ([https://preview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/226024/](https://preview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/226024/)). Clinical annotations of *CYP2C9*8* can be found on PharmGKB at [www.pharmgkb.org/clinicalAnnotation/637879801](http://www.pharmgkb.org/clinicalAnnotation/637879801). Furthermore, although Asn457Ser may not obliterate or severely reduce function on its own, it may, however, further reduce the activity of *CYP2C9*2* by way of a concerted effect caused by Arg144Cys and Asn457Ser as discussed below.

Using the published pharmacogenetic-guided algorithm to predict warfarin dosing in Puerto Ricans, the estimated effective dose in this individual (4.06 mg/day) deviates from the actual stable dose of 3 mg/daily (Δdose = 1.06 mg/day) suggesting that *CYP2C9*61* (carrying Arg144Cys and Asn457Ser) further reduce the activity of the protein encoded by this haplotype. The presence of *CYP2C9*2* was associated with a 7% dose reduction per allele in Puerto Ricans [[12](#B12)] and therefore does not intrinsically explain this dose reduction by the presence of Arg144Cys. However, this patient is also carrier of *CYP2C9*5* (c.1080C>G; Asp360Glu), found to significantly decrease CYP2C9 activity (8–12% compared with *CYP2C9*1*) [[20](#B20)].

Heterozygosity of *CYP4F2*3* is unlikely to cause the degree of sensitivity observed in our patient despite an association with dose resistance in Hispanics [[21](#B21)]. Furthermore, the patient was genotyped as *VKORC1*-1639 G/G, which is known as a ‘high-dose’ haplotype. We cannot, however, discard with certainty that other factors are responsible for the low dose requirement. Factors like the advanced age of the patient (78 years), liver function, co-morbidities, drug-to-drug interactions and the presence of other polymorphisms (*CYP2C9*2* and *CYP2C9*5*) may be underlying causes of the low warfarin dose requirements in the reported case. Clearly, *in vitro* experiments are needed to further determine the impact of this variation on intrinsic clearance of warfarin and other CYP2C9-mediated drugs and ideally more patients to better characterize the functional consequences of this allele *in vivo*.

### Allele frequency & designation

According to the reported minor allele frequencies in the 1000 Genome Project database (N = 2504 individuals from 26 populations), the prevalence of *CYP2C9* rs202201137 (Asn457Ser) is zero in all reference populations worldwide, except in Puerto Rican Hispanics. Among the 104 Puerto Rican subjects in the 1000 Genomes Project, two heterozygous individuals (HG01190 and HG01325) were identified (MAF = 0.010). Also, three individuals participating in eMERGE (two out of 14,788 Europeans and one out of 2837 Africans) were reported to have the *CYP2C9*61*. This variant was, however, not found in any individual in the Children's Mercy Hospital data warehouse ([https://warehouse.cmh.edu/](https://warehouse.cmh.edu/)) with 4700 participants. Clearly, this genetic variant is more frequent in Puerto Ricans than any other ethnic group, but is not necessarily specific to this population.

## Conclusion

In this case report, we describe the discovery of a novel haplotype, *CYP2C9*61*, in a Puerto Rican patient who required significantly lower weekly dosing of warfarin. Although *in-silico* analysis did not suggest that the *CYP2C9*61* signature SNP c.1370A>G (p.Asn457Ser) impacts enzymatic activity, the functional consequence of this amino acid change remains to be functionally validated.
