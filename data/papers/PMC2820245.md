## Abstract

**Aims:** 
A common, functionally significant polymorphism in GRK5 (Gln41Leu) encodes a gain-of-function enzyme that enhances desensitization of the β1-adrenergic receptor. GRK5 Leu41 has been postulated to confer endogenous ‘genetic β-blockade’ and contribute to an attenuated response to β-blockers in black subjects. The effects of this GRK5 variant on sensitivity to a β-blocker have not been studied in humans. We hypothesized that the GRK5 Gln41Leu variant contributes to interindividual variability in response to β-blockade and to the ethnic difference in sensitivity between black and Caucasian individuals.

**Materials & methods:** 
We measured the heart rate at rest and during a graded incremental exercise in 154 healthy subjects (85 white and 69 black) before and after an oral administration of 25 mg atenolol. We determined the genotypes of GRK5 (Gln41Leu), β1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1 Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly) genotypes and plasma atenolol concentrations. The effects of genotype and covariates on sensitivity to atenolol, measured as the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia, were determined using multiple regression analyses.

**Results:** 
The minor allele frequency of GRK5 Leu41 was 32.6% in blacks and 0% in whites. Black individuals were less sensitive to atenolol than white individuals (p ≤ 0.011) but this was not explained by the GRK5 genotype. The GRK5 genotype had no effect on resting heart rate before (p = 0.61) and after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, atenolol concentrations, BMI and ADRB1 genotypes (p = 0.81). The decrease in heart rate after atenolol administration did not differ significantly according to the GRK5 genotype at rest or after exercise, before (all p > 0.14) and after statistical adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.17).

**Conclusion:** 
The GRK5 Gln41Leu polymorphism does not affect sensitivity to the β1-adrenergic blocker, atenolol, during acute physiological adrenergic stimulation, nor does it contribute to the ethnic differences in sensitivity to atenolol among black and Caucasian individuals.

### Aims

A common, functionally significant polymorphism in *GRK5* (Gln41Leu) encodes a gain-of-function enzyme that enhances desensitization of the β_1_-adrenergic receptor. *GRK5* Leu41 has been postulated to confer endogenous ‘genetic β-blockade’ and contribute to an attenuated response to β-blockers in black subjects. The effects of this *GRK5* variant on sensitivity to a β-blocker have not been studied in humans. We hypothesized that the *GRK5* Gln41Leu variant contributes to interindividual variability in response to β-blockade and to the ethnic difference in sensitivity between black and Caucasian individuals.

### Materials & methods

We measured the heart rate at rest and during a graded incremental exercise in 154 healthy subjects (85 white and 69 black) before and after an oral administration of 25 mg atenolol. We determined the genotypes of *GRK5* (Gln41Leu), β_1_-adrenergic receptor (*ADRB1* Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly) genotypes and plasma atenolol concentrations. The effects of genotype and covariates on sensitivity to atenolol, measured as the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia, were determined using multiple regression analyses.

### Results

The minor allele frequency of *GRK5* Leu41 was 32.6% in blacks and 0% in whites. Black individuals were less sensitive to atenolol than white individuals (p ≤ 0.011) but this was not explained by the *GRK5* genotype. The *GRK5* genotype had no effect on resting heart rate before (p = 0.61) and after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, atenolol concentrations, BMI and *ADRB1* genotypes (p = 0.81). The decrease in heart rate after atenolol administration did not differ significantly according to the *GRK5* genotype at rest or after exercise, before (all p > 0.14) and after statistical adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.17).

### Conclusion

The *GRK5* Gln41Leu polymorphism does not affect sensitivity to the β_1_-adrenergic blocker, atenolol, during acute physiological adrenergic stimulation, nor does it contribute to the ethnic differences in sensitivity to atenolol among black and Caucasian individuals.

## Materials & methods

### Subjects & protocol

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (TN, USA) and subjects gave written informed consent. All subjects contributed data to a previous study and details of the study design and methods have been published [[8](#R8)]. Briefly, unrelated black and white American subjects were eligible to participate if they were between the ages of 18–50 years and had no clinically significant abnormality based on medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram and routine laboratory testing. Subjects were free of medications for at least 1 week. They also received an alcohol- and caffeine-free diet for 6 days prior to the study, which provided 150 mmol of sodium, 70 mmol of potassium and 600 mmol of calcium daily.

Subjects performed graded incremental exercise on a supine bicycle ergometer (at 25, 50 and 75 W for 2 min each) before and 2.5 h after oral administration of 25 mg atenolol (Milan Pharmaceuticals Inc., WV, USA). A digitized electrocardiogram was recorded on a personal computer at 500 MHz using the Windaq software (v. 2.20; Data Instruments Inc., OH, USA).

### Genotyping & plasma atenolol concentrations

Genotyping for *GRK5* A122T (rs17098707), corresponding to the Gln41Leu amino acid change in the translated protein, was performed by allelic discrimination with an on-demand TaqMan^®^ 5´-nuclease assay (C-15852506_10) on an ABI 7900 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) using validated TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) and a 95% quality value threshold. Genotyping for the two *ADRB1* SNPs, rs1801252 and rs1801253 (corresponding to Ser49Gly, Arg389Gly), was performed by TaqMan assay as previously described [[8](#R8)]. The genotyping success rate was 94.5, 99.4 and 93.3% for Ser49Gly, *ADRB1* Arg389Gly and *GRK5* Leu41, respectively. Plasma atenolol concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography as previously described [[4](#R4)].

### Data analysis & statistics

Heart rate was determined from the computerized ECG recordings as the mean heart rate during the second minute of each exercise step. To examine the effect of the *GRK5* genotype and potential confounders on atenolol response, multiple linear-regression analyses were performed for the following response variables:

This analysis was adjusted for the corresponding heart rate (or heart-rate AUC) before atenolol, age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, *S*-atenolol plasma concentrations, and *ADRB1* Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly genotypes. Analyses were performed with the statistical software R [[101](#R19)]. Assuming a mean heart-rate reduction at 75 W of 13.6 ± 8.4 beats per minute (bpm) [[8](#R8)] and a *GRK5* Gln41Leu carrier rate of 55% among black subjects (corresponding to a minor allele frequency of approximately 0.35), a sample size of 63 black subjects would provide 80 and 90% power at an α value of 0.05 to detect a difference of 6 and 7 bpm respectively, among *GRK5* genotype groups.

## Results

### Subject characteristics & genotypes

We studied 154 healthy subjects (85 white individuals and 69 black individuals). The subject characteristics are shown in [Table 1](#T1). There were proportionally more black than white female subjects (68.1% compared with 47.1%) and black subjects had a higher BMI (26.9 ± 6.3 kg/m^2^ compared with 24.3 ± 3.8 kg/m^2^; p = 0.004) than white subjects.

Table 1 Caption: Characteristics of white and black subjects

The minor allele frequencies for *GRK5* (0 and 32.6% in white and black subjects, respectively; p < 0.001) were in the expected range and genotype distributions (85/0/0 and 29/35/5 for Gln/Gln, Gln/Leu and Leu/Leu in white and black subjects, respectively) conformed to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (χ^2^ = 1.64; p = 0.20 for blacks).

### Effects of GRK5: resting & exercise measures before atenolol

The *GRK5* genotype had no effect on baseline cardiovascular measures before (p = 0.61) and after adjustment for age, ethnicity, sex, BMI, and *ADRB1* Arg389Gly and Ser49Gly genotypes (all p = 0.81). Similarly, the *GRK5* genotype did not affect the increase in heart rate during exercise, as assessed by the heart-rate AUC, before (p = 0.12) and after (p = 0.80) adjustment for covariates.

### Effects of GRK5: resting & exercise measures after atenolol

The *GRK5* genotype did not affect the atenolol-induced decrease in heart rate at rest or at maximal exercise before adjustment (p = 0.14 and p = 0.31 at rest and at 75 W, respectively; [Figure 1A](#F1)) or after adjustment for covariates (p = 0.44 and p = 0.80 at rest and at 75 W, respectively; [Table 2](#T2)). Similarly, the summary measure of atenolol effect during the entire exercise period, the AUC of the atenolol-induced reduction in heart rate, was not associated with the *GRK5* genotype before (p = 0.29) or after adjustment for covariates (p = 0.17). When only black subjects were considered, there was again no effect of the *GRK5* genotype at rest or at maximal exercise before adjustment (p = 0.43 and p = 0.71 at rest and at 75 W, respectively; [Figure 1B](#F1)) or after adjustment for covariates (p = 0.65 and p = 0.91 at rest and at 75 W, respectively). The AUC of the atenolol-induced reduction in heart rate when only black subjects were considered was not associated with the *GRK5* genotype before (p = 0.49) or after (p = 0.35) adjustment for covariates.

Table 2 Caption: Effect of genotype, ethnicity and covariates on atenolol-induced reduction in heart rate (at rest, 75 w exercise and heart rate area under the curve.

As shown in our previous analysis [[8](#R8)], atenolol reduced heart rates to a greater extent in white than in black subjects at rest (mean adjusted difference: 4.4 bpm; 95% CI: 1.7–7.2 bpm, p = 0.002; [Table 2](#T2)) and at maximal exercise (mean adjusted difference: 4.0 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.9–7.0, p = 0.011; [Table 2](#T2)), corresponding to a 1.4–1.8-fold greater decrease in heart rate in whites compared with blacks. Similarly, we confirmed our previous findings that *S*-atenolol plasma concentrations, male gender and *ADRB1* Arg389Gly genotype were associated with a greater heart-rate reduction after atenolol consumption ([Table 2](#T2)).

## Discussion

This is the first study to examine the effects of a functional genetic variant in *GRK5* on β-blocker sensitivity in humans. Our main findings are that the presence of the *GRK5* Leu41 allele does not affect the response to a β-blocker during acute adrenergic stimulation in healthy subjects, nor does it contribute to the differences in sensitivity observed between black and white individuals.

Since there are no selective antagonists for specific *GRK* subtypes, the functional role of *GRK* subtypes in healthy humans can only be extrapolated from animal studies (mainly in knock-out mice) and quantitative data on protein and mRNA expression in human hearts. Both *GRK2* and *GRK5* are abundantly expressed in the normal human heart, in approximately similar amounts, depending on the location within the four heart chambers [[12](#R12),[13](#R13)]. Both mediate β_1_-adrenoceptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment, resulting in the uncoupling from G-proteins, and therefore are believed to act as physiological regulators of β-AR activity [[14](#R14)]. β_1_-AR desensitization also occurs in normal subjects after short-term physiological or pharmacological sympathetic stimulation [[15](#R15)]. Thus, *GRK2* and *GRK5* are likely to contribute to the physiological desensitization of β_1_-ARs in humans.

The *GRK5* Gln41Leu variant encodes a gain-of-function enzyme resulting in enhanced *in vitro* desensitization of the β_1_-AR [[10](#R10)]. Transfected cells expressing the Leu41 variant show enhanced desensitization and a 33% lower maximal response after prolonged agonist stimulation than Gln41-expressing cells [[10](#R10)]. Similarly, *in vivo* phenotypic differences are observed following stimulation with an agonist. The dose response to isoproterenol is shifted to the right in transgenic mice expressing *Grk5* Leu41, and after prolonged infusion of isoproterenol there is enhanced desensitization and a faster decline in myocardial contractility [[10](#R10)]. In keeping with this enhanced desensitization of adrenergic responses, *Grk5* Leu41 transgenic mice are protected from chronic catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy [[10](#R10)], a phenotype that mimics pharmacological β-blockade.

There is little information regarding the effects of the *GRK5* Gln41Leu variant in humans. In patients with heart failure, *GRK5* Leu41 is associated with improved survival. Moreover, in contrast with *GRK5* Gln41 homozygotes, β-blocker therapy does not improve the outcome (death or heart transplantation) in carriers of the Leu41 allele [[10](#R10)]. The observations in transgenic mice and in patients with heart failure are compatible with the concept of endogenous genetic β-blockade mediated by enhanced desensitization to adrenergic stimulation as a result of the variant *GRK5* Leu41 [[10](#R10)]. Thus, we hypothesized that in individuals carrying the Leu41 allele, the increase in heart rate in response to exercise would be attenuated (analogous to the shifted dose response to isoproterenol in the animal model) and that responses to atenolol would be smaller (since there would already be a phenotype analogous to endogenous β-blockade). The latter hypothesis was based on the fact that the Leu41 allele is much more common in African–Americans, a group in whom attenuated responses to β-blockers have been reported [[16](#R16)].

We previously demonstrated that attenuated responses to atenolol in black compared with white subjects were not explained by common *ADRB1* variants, although these variants did affect responses to atenolol [[8](#R8)]. Thus, in view of its functional characteristics and ethnic distribution, the *GRK5* Gln41Leu variant was considered a potential explanation for the ethnic difference in sensitivity to β-blockade. However, we found that *GRK5* Leu41 did not affect the attenuation of exercise-induced tachycardia by atenolol, nor did it contribute to ethnic differences in sensitivity to atenolol – depending on the exercise stage, white subjects had a 1.4–1.8-fold greater reduction in heart rate, a finding that was not affected after adjusting for the *GRK5* genotype. Specific components of the study design warrant consideration in the interpretation of the results.

Our study had a number of strengths that maximized our ability to detect a genetic signal, as indeed we did for *ADRB1* variants. These include the assessment of sensitivity to β-blockade using a robust measure (attenuation of exercise-induced tachycardia [[17](#R17)]), a carefully controlled setting, a physiological stimulus, statistical adjustment for potential genetic and environmental confounding variables, and the selection of healthy individuals to minimize the confounding effect of disease and concomitant medications on the outcome. The adrenergic stimulus (6 min of incremental exercise) represents acute, intensive β_1_-AR stimulation, and it could be argued that more prolonged adrenergic stimulation would be more likely to elucidate an effect on desensitization. However, desensitization can occur rapidly during adrenergic stimulation [[15](#R15)], and even at rest there is some chronic downregulation of β-receptors in humans [[18](#R18)]. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the *GRK5* Gln41Leu polymorphism could have different effects on sensitivity to β-blockers under conditions of chronic excessive sympathetic stimulation, as occurs in patients with heart failure, for example.

In human myocytes from failing hearts, *GRK*s are upregulated and contribute to chronic β_1_-AR desensitization. Upregulation of the different *GRK* subtypes is dynamic, complex and affected by the exact localization within the heart, concomitant drug therapy and disease stage. In heart failure, the *GRK2* subtype appears to be upregulated to a greater extent than *GRK5* [[12](#R12),[13](#R13)], suggesting that the relative contribution of *GRK5* to total *GRK* activity is lower than in the nonfailing myocardium. Thus, since the precise physiological role and regulation of the *GRK5* subtype in human hearts in health and disease is poorly characterized, we cannot extrapolate our findings to subjects substantially different from our study group, such as elderly subjects, cardiac patients or patients on chronic β-blocker therapy, or disease states such as heart failure.

Our study was sufficiently powered to detect differences of approximately 40% in maximal heart-rate reduction among the *GRK5* genotype groups, a magnitude similar to the ethnic difference and is potentially clinically meaningful. Larger cohorts will be necessary to exclude smaller genotype effects; however, if present, the clinical relevance of such smaller genotype effects would be uncertain.

## Conclusion

Our results suggest that the *GRK5* Gln41Leu polymorphism does not affect sensitivity to the β_1_-adrenergic blocker atenolol during acute physiological adrenergic stimulation, nor does it contribute to the ethnic differences observed in sensitivity to atenolol.

### Executive summary

### Future perspective

Studies examining the effect of the *GRK5* genotype on adrenergic stimulation and β-blockade in models of chronic, moderate-intensity adrenergic stimulation will be of interest. In addition, ethnic differences in response to acute β_1_-blockade remain unexplained. Therefore, future studies could focus on other candidate genes in the β_1_-AR signal-transduction pathway with polymorphisms whose prevalence differs significantly among ethnicities.
