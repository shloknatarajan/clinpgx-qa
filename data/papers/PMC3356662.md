## Abstract

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility is a dominantly inherited disorder in which volatile anesthetics trigger aberrant Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle and a potentially fatal rise in perioperative body temperature. Mutations causing MH susceptibility have been identified in two proteins critical for excitation–contraction (EC) coupling, the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and CaV1.1, the principal subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel. All of the mutations that have been characterized previously augment EC coupling and/or increase the rate of L-type Ca2+ entry. The CaV1.1 mutation R174W associated with MH susceptibility occurs at the innermost basic residue of the IS4 voltage-sensing helix, a residue conserved among all CaV channels [Carpenter D, et al. (2009) BMC Med Genet 10:104–115.]. To define the functional consequences of this mutation, we expressed it in dysgenic (CaV1.1 null) myotubes. Unlike previously described MH-linked mutations in CaV1.1, R174W ablated the L-type current and had no effect on EC coupling. Nonetheless, R174W increased sensitivity of Ca2+ release to caffeine (used for MH diagnostic in vitro testing) and to volatile anesthetics. Moreover, in CaV1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes, resting myoplasmic Ca2+ levels were elevated, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores were partially depleted, compared with myotubes expressing wild-type CaV1.1. Our results indicate that CaV1.1 functions not only to activate RyR1 during EC coupling, but also to suppress resting RyR1-mediated Ca2+ leak from the SR, and that perturbation of CaV1.1 negative regulation of RyR1 leak identifies a unique mechanism that can sensitize muscle cells to MH triggers.

## Results

### R174W Mutation in CaV1.1 Ablates L-Type Ca2+ Current.

Because the R174W mutation occurs at a highly conserved position in a region of Ca_V_1.1 (IS4) known to be important in sensing changes in membrane potential ([23](#r23), [24](#r24)), we first examined whether the R174W mutation affected the ability of Ca_V_1.1 to function as an L-type Ca^2+^ channel. For this, we constructed a YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W fusion construct and expressed the mutant channel in *dysgenic* (effectively Ca_V_1.1 null) myotubes. Remarkably, YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W yielded no inward Ca^2+^ current under our standard recording conditions (*n* = 7; [Fig. 1A](#fig01)) even though the fluorescence arising from the YFP tag indicated normal expression and targeting of the mutant channel ([Fig. S1](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF1)). In contrast to YFP-Ca_V_1.1, which predictably produced robust L-type current (−6.1 ± 0.7 pA/pF at +50 mV, *n* = 32; [Fig. 1B](#fig01)), YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W had an *I–V* relationship that was nearly superimposable on that of naive *dysgenic* myotubes ([Fig. 1C](#fig01) and [Table S1](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=ST1)). To determine whether the absence of L-type current in YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes was a consequence of fewer channels present in the membrane, we recorded intramembrane charge movements. Myotubes expressing YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W produced maximal charge movement (6.5 ± 0.7 nC/μF, *n* = 7; [Fig. 1D](#fig01)) that was similar to that of YFP-Ca_V_1.1-expressing myotubes (7.6 ± 0.9 nC/μF, *n* = 12; *P* > 0.05, unpaired *t* test; [Fig. 1E](#fig01) and [Table S1](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=ST1)) and was substantially larger than that of naive *dysgenic* myotubes (1.6 ± 0.2 nC/μF, *n* = 6; *P* < 0.001, ANOVA; [Fig. 1F](#fig01) and [Table S1](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=ST1)). Thus, the absence of L-type current in YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes was not a consequence of poor membrane expression of the mutant channel. We observed no clear difference in the voltage dependence of charge movement between YFP-Ca_V_1.1– and YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes (*VQ* = −7.4 ± 2.0 vs. −6.4 ± 2.4 mV, respectively; *P* > 0.05, unpaired *t* test; [Fig. 1F](#fig01) and [Table S1](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=ST1)).

(A and B) Representative currents evoked from −50 mV to −10, 10, 30, and 50 mV are shown for dysgenic myotubes expressing either YFP-CaV1.1 R174W (A) or YFP-CaV1.1 (B).

In the case of YFP-CaV1.1 R174W, I–V data were collected only from the 7 myotubes where channel expression was confirmed by charge movement; no inward current was observed in 10 additional dysgenic myotubes displaying yellow fluorescence. Currents were evoked at 0.1 Hz by test potentials ranging from −20 mV through +90 mV in 10-mV increments, following a prepulse protocol (41). Current amplitudes were normalized by linear cell capacitance (pA/pF). The smooth curve for YFP-CaV1.1 is plotted according to Eq. 1, with best-fit parameters presented in Table S1.

### EC Coupling Is Little Affected by the CaV1.1 R174W Mutation.

To determine whether the R174W mutation altered EC coupling, as has been demonstrated for other MH-causing mutations in either RyR1 ([14](#r14)–[20](#r20), [25](#r25)–[27](#r27)) or Ca_V_1.1 ([21](#r21)), we measured myoplasmic Ca^2+^ transients in the whole-cell configuration. As shown in [Fig. 2A](#fig02), *dysgenic* myotubes expressing YFP-Ca_V_1.1 produced robust Ca^2+^ transients with a mean Δ*F*/*F*_max_ of 1.82 ± 0.63 (*n* = 11) and an activation midpoint (*VF*) of 14.0 ± 2.5 mV. *Dysgenic* myotubes expressing YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W yielded Ca^2+^ transients that were similar both in magnitude (Δ*F*/*F*_max_ = 1.85 ± 0.49, *n* = 6; *P* > 0.05, unpaired *t* test; [Fig. 2 B and C](#fig02) and [Table S2](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=ST2)) and in voltage dependence (*VF* = 10.1 ± 1.5 mV; *P* > 0.05, unpaired *t* test; [Table S2](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=ST2)).

The R174W mutation has little effect on the ability of CaV1.1 to function as the voltage sensor for EC coupling. (A and B) Recordings of myoplasmic Ca2+ transients elicited by 50-ms depolarizations from −50 mV to −20, −10, 0, 10, 20, and 30 mV are shown for dysgenic myotubes expressing either YFP-CaV1.1 (A) or YFP-CaV1.1 R174W (B). (C) Average ΔF/F–V relationships for dysgenic myotubes expressing either YFP-CaV1.1 (●; n = 11) or YFP-CaV1.1 R174W (○; n = 7) fitted by Eq. 3 with the parameters presented in Table S1. (D and E) Representative elevated K+-induced Ca2+ transients in dysgenic myotubes stably expressing wild-type CaV1.1 (D) or CaV1.1 R174W (E). (F) K+ dose–response relationships for dysgenic myotubes stably expressing either wild-type CaV1.1 (n = 19) or CaV1.1 R174W (n = 32) fitted by Eq. 4. (G and H) Representative caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients in dysgenic myotubes stably expressing CaV1.1 (G) or CaV1.1 R174W (H). At the beginning of each experiment, myotubes were exposed to K+ (60 mM) for 10 s to confirm either wild-type or mutant CaV1.1 expression. (I) Caffeine dose–response relationships for dysgenic myotubes stably expressing either wild-type CaV1.1 (n = 24) or CaV1.1 R174W (n = 28) fitted by Eq. 4.

As an additional means to study possible alterations in the ability of Ca_V_1.1 R174W to engage EC coupling, we created cell lines stably expressing either wild-type Ca_V_1.1 or Ca_V_1.1 R174W from *dysgenic* progenitor cells ([Fig. S2](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF2)). Myoplasmic Ca^2+^ transients in these cells were measured in response to depolarization by elevated extracellular K^+^. In these experiments, myotubes expressing either Ca_V_1.1 or Ca_V_1.1 R174W displayed virtually identical responses to elevated K^+^ (EC_50_ = 18.9 ± 0.6 mM, *n* = 19, and 18.0 ± 0.9 mM, *n* = 31, respectively; *P* > 0.05, *t* test; [Fig. 2 D–F](#fig02)). Thus, the R174W mutation ablates the ability of Ca_V_1.1 to conduct L-type Ca^2+^ current but has little, if any, effect on its function to serve as the voltage sensor for EC coupling.

Hypersensitivity to the RyR1 agonist caffeine in the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) is a benchmark diagnostic assay for MH susceptibility ([3](#r3), [28](#r28)). For this reason, we assessed the caffeine sensitivities of wild-type Ca_V_1.1- and Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes. At the beginning of each experiment, myotubes were first exposed to a 60-mM K^+^ challenge to confirm channel expression. Then, myotubes were exposed to progressively higher concentrations of caffeine to elicit Ca^2+^ release from the SR ([Fig. 2 G and H](#fig02)). As would be expected for MH-susceptible muscle ([10](#r10), [29](#r29)), Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes were more sensitive to caffeine (EC_50_ = 2.6 ± 0.2 mM, *n* = 28) than myotubes expressing Ca_V_1.1 (EC_50_ = 4.8 ± 0.4 mM, *n* = 24; *P* < 0.001, *t* test; [Fig. 2I](#fig02)).

### Dysgenic Myotubes Expressing CaV1.1 R174W Have Elevated Resting Ca2+ Levels and Are More Sensitive to MH Triggers.

Despite ablating L-type Ca^2+^ current and having no discernible effect on EC coupling, the R174W mutation surprisingly resulted in an elevation of resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^ ([Fig. 3](#fig03)). As measured with Ca^2+^-selective microelectrodes, Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes had an average resting Ca^2+^ concentration that was nearly twice that observed in myotubes expressing wild-type Ca_V_1.1 (234 ± 4 nM, *n* = 33 vs. 120 ± 1 nM, *n* = 18, respectively; *P* < 0.001, unpaired *t* test) and similar to those previously reported for other MH susceptibility genotypes ([30](#r30)). The mutation also altered the effects of known MH triggers on Ca^2+^ levels. In wild-type Ca_V_1.1-expressing myotubes, neither isoflurane nor the more potent halothane (both 0.1% by volume) caused a change in myoplasmic Ca^2+^ (120 ± 1 nM, *n* = 15 and 121 ± 2 nM, *n* = 12, respectively; *P* > 0.05, ANOVA; [Fig. 3](#fig03)). In stark contrast, these volatile anesthetics caused myoplasmic Ca^2+^ in Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes to increase by nearly fivefold (863 ± 21 nM, *n* = 8 and 1,234 ± 21 nM, *n* = 10, respectively; *P* < 0.001, ANOVA; [Fig. 3](#fig03)). We next investigated whether a partially depleted SR Ca^2+^ store was associated with the elevation in resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^, by exposing myotubes to ionomycin (5 μM) in a nominally Ca^2+^-free medium ([22](#r22)). As shown in [Fig. 4](#fig04), the content of the SR Ca^2+^ store was less in Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes than in those expressing wild-type Ca_V_1.1 (integrated area under transient = 16.21 ± 3.05 arbitrary fluorescence units (afu)⋅s, *n* = 39 and 31.94 ± 3.57 afu⋅s, *n* = 33, respectively; *P* < 0.01, *t* test), consistent with the idea that resting SR Ca^2+^ leak is increased by Ca_V_1.1 R174W.

Application of the L-type channel antagonist nifedipine had little effect on resting Ca^2+^ in either wild-type Ca_V_1.1-expressing or Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes (118 ± 3 nM, *n* = 6 and 238 ± 3 nM, *n* = 6, respectively; *P* > 0.05, ANOVA, in both cases; [Table 1](#t01)), suggesting that the elevated resting Ca^2+^ levels were not a consequence of depolarization-dependent Ca_V_1.1 activity. On the other hand, exposure to dantrolene decreased resting Ca^2+^ in Ca_V_1.1 R174W myotubes (94 ± 2, *n* = 10; *P* < 0.05, ANOVA; [Table 1](#t01)) but produced little effect on resting Ca^2+^ in wild-type Ca_V_1.1-expressing myotubes (89 ± 1, *n* = 10; *P* > 0.05, ANOVA; [Table 1](#t01)). Additionally, the elevation in resting Ca^2+^ was partially blocked by bastadin 5, obtained from the marine sponge *Ianthella basta* ([Table 1](#t01)) ([31](#r31)).

## Discussion

The results reported here identify a mechanism for MH susceptibility fundamentally different from those ascribed to other MH-causing mutations, which either enhance entry of Ca^2+^ via the L-type channel or shift the equilibrium of RyR1 toward the activated (open) state. Importantly, we find that the R174W mutation does not alter the voltage dependence of EC coupling ([Fig. 2](#fig02)), which indicates that this mutation does not shift the equilibrium of RyR1 toward the activated state. Furthermore, the mutation obviously does not promote L-type Ca^2+^ entry ([Fig. 1](#fig01)). However, our results are consistent with the idea that the R174W mutation in Ca_V_1.1 derepresses Ca^2+^ efflux from the SR in resting muscle cells. Thus, the Ca_V_1.1–RyR1 interaction appears to have three manifestations: (*i*) Ca_V_1.1-mediated engagement of EC coupling via RyR1, (*ii*) RyR1-dependent retrograde enhancement of L-type current via Ca_V_1.1, and (*iii*) Ca_V_1.1-mediated suppression of a resting SR Ca^2+^ leak via RyR1. Evidence for the last of these is provided by our previous work, which showed that resting SR Ca^2+^ stores are reduced, and myoplasmic Ca^2+^ levels are higher, in naive *dysgenic* (i.e., Ca_V_1.1-lacking) myotubes compared with wild-type myotubes ([22](#r22)), suggesting that Ca_V_1.1 represses a resting Ca^2+^ leak from the SR via RyR1 ([Fig. 5A](#fig05)). The increase in resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^ in Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing myotubes is also accompanied by a reduction in the resting SR Ca^2+^ store ([Fig. 4](#fig04)). This leak pathway in *dysgenic* myotubes appears to be distinct from the conventional activated state of RyR1 because it is blocked by bastadin 5 (or bastadin 5 in the presence of ryanodine) but not by ryanodine alone ([32](#r32), [33](#r33)); bastadin 5 (B5) application also causes a partial reduction in resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^ in *dysgenic* myotubes expressing Ca_V_1.1 R174W ([Table 1](#t01)). As shown in [Fig. 5B](#fig05), expression of wild-type Ca_V_1.1 in *dysgenic* myotubes represses the resting Ca^2+^ leak ([22](#r22)) and restores both EC coupling and L-type current ([6](#r6)). The R174W mutation alters the resting conformation of Ca_V_1.1 such that it no longer suppresses resting Ca^2+^ leak via RyR1 but does not noticeably alter its function as the voltage sensor for EC coupling ([Fig. 5C](#fig05)). It should be pointed out that the level of resting Ca^2+^ in Ca_V_1.1 R174W-expressing *dysgenic* myotubes (234 ± 4 nM; [Table 1](#t01)) is higher than that in naive *dysgenic* myotubes (163 ± 2.5 nM) ([22](#r22)), which suggests that in addition to removing block of the resting RyR1 leak, the R174W mutation also serves to amplify this resting leak.

The R174W mutation in CaV1.1 disrupts the resting interaction between CaV1.1 and RyR1 that supresses Ca2+ leak from the SR. (A) Our previous work in dysgenic myotubes has demonstrated that the absence of CaV1.1 reveals a leak state of RyR1 (Left) that increases resting Ca2+ (22). Additionally, the absence of the CaV1.1 voltage sensor renders dysgenic myotubes incapable of EC coupling or generating L-type Ca2+ current during plasma membrane depolarization (Right) (42). (B) When present, CaV1.1 inhibits Ca2+ leak from the SR via RyR1 at rest (Left) and responds to depolarization by engaging EC coupling in Ca2+ release and producing L-type current (Right) (6). (C) The R174W mutation alters the conformation of CaV1.1 such that it does not suppress resting SR Ca2+ leak, leading to an increase in resting Ca2+ and enhanced sensitivity to MH triggers (Left; Fig. 3); the R174W mutation also ablates the ability of CaV1.1 to produce L-type current but has little, if any, effect on the ability of CaV1.1 to engage EC coupling (Right).

Additional evidence supporting a causative role of resting leak in MH pathogenesis is that dantrolene, the clinical “antidote” for MH crises, restores resting Ca^2+^ to normal levels in *dysgenic* myotubes expressing Ca_V_1.1 R174W ([Table 1](#t01)). Thus, our findings identify a unique mechanism underlying a potentially fatal human disorder. In particular, the R174W mutation disrupts the ability of Ca_V_1.1 to repress resting Ca^2+^ leak from the SR via RyR1, leading to elevated resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^ and increased sensitivity to MH triggers. Significantly, elevations in resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^ that are not blocked by ryanodine have also been observed in *dyspedic* myotubes expressing eight distinct RyR1 MH-linked mutations ([30](#r30)). Thus, other mutations in either Ca_V_1.1 or RyR1 may potentially lead to increased resting Ca^2+^ leak. Although increased SR Ca^2+^ leak may represent a sensitizing mechanism, it is almost certain that multiple mechanisms are at work in MH susceptibility. In this regard, any mechanism that causes sustained, partial SR Ca^2+^ store depletion would presumably result in a sustained increase in store-operated Ca^2+^ entry ([34](#r34), [35](#r35)) and thus increased resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^. Simply raising myoplasmic Ca^2+^ would be expected to increase the efficacy of other activators (e.g., caffeine and volatile anesthetics). Moreover, chronically elevated myoplasmic Ca^2+^ levels could have downstream sequelae as a result of altered mitochondrial metabolism ([17](#r17), [36](#r36)).

In conclusion, we have described a unique mechanism whereby a mutation of Ca_V_1.1 promotes MH susceptibility by causing an increase in resting SR Ca^2+^ leak. It will be important to determine the extent to which an enhanced resting leak contributes to MH susceptibility for other Ca_V_1.1 and RyR1 mutations.

## Materials and Methods

YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W was derived from the plasmid YFP-Ca_V_1.1 ([37](#r37)), using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies).

### Primary Culture and cDNA Expression.

All procedures involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of University of Colorado Denver and Harvard Medical School. Primary cultures of *dysgenic* myotubes were prepared as described previously ([38](#r38)). Single nuclei of differentiated myotubes were microinjected with 200 ng/μL plasmid cDNA encoding either YFP-Ca_V_1.1 or YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W.

### Generation of Myoblasts Stably Expressing Wild-Type CaV1.1 or CaV1.1-R174W.

cDNAs encoding either wild-type Ca_V_1.1 ([22](#r22)) or Ca_V_1.1 R174W were subcloned between the LTRs of a lentiviral vector driven by an EF1α human promoter ([22](#r22), [39](#r39)). The lentiviral particles were packaged by transfection of HEK 293T cells as described previously ([40](#r40)). *Dysgenic* myoblasts were transduced with lentiviral particles and were replated with one cell per well in 96-well culture plates 24 h later. After 2–3 wk, myoblasts from 20–30 clones were plated in 96-well plates and differentiated into myotubes. To screen for expression of either Ca_V_1.1 or Ca_V_1.1 R174W, myotubes were loaded with Fluo-4 AM and challenged by K^+^ depolarization (see below); positive myotubes were identified by the ability to support Ca^2+^ transients in response to depolarization.

### Electrophysiology.

Electrophysiological experiments were performed with *dysgenic* myotubes expressing either YFP-Ca_V_1.1 or YFP-Ca_V_1.1 R174W 2 d postmicroinjection. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass and had resistances of ∼2.0 MΩ when filled with internal solution, which consisted of 140 mM Cs-aspartate, 10 mM Cs_2_-EGTA, 5 mM MgCl_2_, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with CsOH. The external solution contained 145 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA)-Cl, 10 mM CaCl_2_, 0.002 mM tetrodotoxin, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with TEA-OH. For measurement of charge movements, 0.5 mM CdCl_2_ and 0.1 mM LaCl_3_ were added to the external solution. Filtering was at 2 kHz (eight-pole Bessel filter; Frequency Devices) and digitization was either at 10 kHz (l currents) or 20 kHz (charge movements). Current–voltage (*I–V*) curves were fitted according to

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
where *I* is the current for the test potential *V*, *V*_rev_ is the reversal potential, *G*_max_ is the maximum Ca^2+^ channel conductance, *V*_1/2_ is the half-maximal activation potential, and *kG* is the slope factor. Plots of the integral of *Q*_on_ as a function of test potential (*V*) were fitted according to

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
where *Q*_max_ is the maximal *Q*_on_, *VQ* is the potential causing movement of half the maximal charge, and *kQ* is a slope parameter.

### Whole-Cell Measurement of Ca2+ Transients.

Changes in intracellular Ca^2+^ were recorded with Fluo-3 (F-3715; Invitrogen). The dye was added to the internal solution for a final concentration of 200 μM. After entry into the whole-cell configuration, a period of >5 min was used to allow the dye to diffuse into the cell interior. The peak fluorescence change (Δ*F*/*F*) for each test potential (*V*) was fitted according to

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
where (Δ*F*/*F*)_max_ is the maximal fluorescence change, *VF* is the potential causing half the maximal change in fluorescence, and *kF* is a slope parameter.

### Intact Myotube Ca2+ Imaging.

Differentiated *dysgenic* myotubes stably expressing wild-type Ca_V_1.1 or Ca_V_1.1 R174W were loaded with 5 μM Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C and washed with Imaging Solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl_2_, 1 mM CaCl_2_, 5.5 mM glucose, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH). The Ca^2+^ signal was monitored using 480/30-nm excitation and 535/40-nm emission wavelengths. The peak response to a given K^+^ or caffeine concentration [(Δ*F*/*F*)_norm_] was quantified as the integrated area under the curve normalized by the maximal response to either agent (60 or 40 mM, respectively). Dose–response relationships were fit by the equation

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
where EC_50_ is the concentration that produces the half-maximal response, *X* is the concentration of K^+^ or caffeine applied, and *k* is a slope parameter.

### Resting Myoplasmic Ca2+ Measurements.

Resting myoplasmic Ca^2+^ levels in intact myotubes were assessed with double-barreled Ca^2+^-selective microelectrodes as described previously in ref. [22](#r22).

### Assessment of SR Ca2+ Stores.

*Dysgenic* myotubes stably expressing either wild-type Ca_V_1.1 or Ca_V_1.1 R174W were loaded with Fluo-4 AM (5 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated with nominally 0 mM Ca^2+^ Krebs Ringer solution supplemented with 2 mM EGTA. Ca^2+^ release from the SR was induced by the application of Krebs Ringer containing ionomycin (5 μM) and quantified by the integrated area under the resultant Ca^2+^ transient. The Ca^2+^ signal was monitored using 480/30-nm excitation and 535/40-nm emission wavelengths; the emission signal was acquired at 30 frames per second.

### Statistical Analysis.

Figures were made using SigmaPlot 11.0 (SSPS). All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Comparisons were made by unpaired, two-tailed *t* test or one-way ANOVA coupled with Tukey’s *t* test (as appropriate), with *P* < 0.05 considered significant. A more complete description of experimental methods is included in [SI Materials and Methods](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1119207109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201119207SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=STXT).
