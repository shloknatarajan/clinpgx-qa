## Abstract

**Aim:** 
To evaluate top-ranking genes identified through genome-wide association studies for an association with corticosteroid-related osteonecrosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received Dana–Farber Cancer Institute treatment protocols.

**Patients & methods:** 
Lead SNPs from these studies, as well as other variants in the same genes, pooled from whole exome sequencing data, were analyzed for an association with osteonecrosis in childhood ALL patients from Quebec cohort. Top-ranking variants were verified in the replication patient group.

**Results:** 
The analyses of variants in the ACP1-SH3YL1 locus derived from whole exome sequencing data showed an association of several correlated SNPs (rs11553746, rs2290911, rs7595075, rs2306060 and rs79716074). The rs79716074 defines *B haplotype of the APC1 gene, which is well known for its functional role.

**Conclusion:** 
This study confirms implication of the ACP1 gene in the treatment-related osteonecrosis in childhood ALL and identifies novel, potentially causal variant of this complication.

## Patients & methods

### Study population

The discovery cohort, Quebec childhood acute lymploblastic leukemia (QcALL), consisted of 297 Caucasian children and adolescent from Quebec diagnosed with ALL (incident cases) at the University Health Center Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada. Patients were treated in accordance with DFCI ALL Consortium protocols (DFCI 87-01, 91-01, 95-01 or 00-01) between January 1987 and July 2005 [[17](#B17)]. The replication cohort (DFCI) consisted of 177 nonincident Caucasian patients who underwent treatment with DFCI 00-01 protocol in the nine remaining DFCI Consortium Institutions. Patients with available clinical data and DNA samples that allowed successful genotyping were included in the study ([Supplementary Figure 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2019-0087/suppl_file/pgs-20-1189-s1.pdf)). Description of these cohorts and DFCI treatment regimens is provided elsewhere [[4–6](#B4),[17–19](#B17)]; patients' characteristics are also given in [Supplementary Table 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2019-0087/suppl_file/pgs-20-1189-s2.pdf). Briefly, all patients received PDN during the induction phase (40 mg/m^2^/day); CS were administered during the intensification and continuation phases as 5-day pulses every 3 weeks until the completion of therapy. On protocols 87-01 and 95-01, PDN was used during these treatment phases, on Protocol 91-01, DXM was used instead of prednisone and on Protocol 00-01, patients were randomized to receive either PDN or DXM. Standard-risk (SR) patients received DXM at a dose of 6 mg/m^2^/day or PDN at a dose of 40 mg/m^2^/day and high-risk (HR) patients received doses three-times higher than those received by SR patients during both the intensification and continuation phases, except on protocol 00-01 when HR patients received the same dose as SR patients during the continuation phase [[18](#B18)]. Information on symptomatic ON (corresponding to NCI grades 2–4) [[20](#B20)] in QcALL was collected from the patients' medical files and was defined as persistent bone pain or motor function limitations associated with ON lesion confirmed by radiological examination such as x-ray radiography, computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. For the DFCI patients, ON was reported by each participating institution as part of bony morbidity.

### Genotyping

GWAS hits [[12](#B12),[15](#B15),[16](#B16)] have been investigated for an association with symptomatic ON in QcALL cohort; 16 SNPs were reported as top-ranking SNPs associated with ON ([Supplementary Tables 2 & 3](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2019-0087/suppl_file/pgs-20-1189-s2.pdf)) [[12](#B12),[15](#B15),[16](#B16)]. *ACP1/SHY3L1* locus was the only top-ranking locus reported by Kawedia *et al.* [[16](#B16)]; several SNPs associated with ON were identified in that study with p ranging from 1.2 × 10^-6^ to 4.6 × 10^-6^. Remaining SNPs were lead SNPs reported in GWAS by Karol *et al.* in 2015 and 2016 [[12](#B12),[15](#B15)]. From Karol *et al.* [[12](#B12),[15](#B15)], we included all SNPs reported by the authors as top-ranking SNPs from meta-analysis of several cohorts (provided in the main table of the article, p range from 2.7 × 10^-8^ to 8.6 × 10^-6^). Similar reasoning, while keeping the same p-value range, was followed for the selection of SNPs from Karol *et al.* [[12](#B12),[15](#B15)]. Three SNPs with MAF lower than 5% in the population of European ancestry were excluded, resulting in 13 SNPs included in the analyses ([Table 1](#T1)). The genotypes were obtained at Sequenom platform at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre or by PCR-coupled allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization assay [[18](#B18),[21](#B21)]. In addition, other variants located in the same genes, were pooled from WES data, which were available for 277 patients of QcALL cohort [[22](#B22)]. For the common SNP analyses, exonic variants that had MAF lower than 5%, with missing rate higher than 20% or not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.001) were excluded from the analysis, resulting in 43 SNPs located in 12 genes that were included in the association analyses with ON ([Supplementary Table 4](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2019-0087/suppl_file/pgs-20-1189-s2.pdf)). Positively associated SNPs were subsequently genotyped in all patients of QcALL cohort and analyzed in the replication DFCI cohort. The rare variants (MAF < 5%) from WES data were also analyzed in the same set of genes using collapsing approach whereby minor alleles of at least two variants within one gene, each in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and with missing rate <20% are analyzed together ([Supplementary Table 5](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2019-0087/suppl_file/pgs-20-1189-s2.pdf)).

### Statistical analysis

Association of genotypes with the presence of ON (at least one incident during the 2 years of therapy) was assessed by χ^2^ test or Fisher exact test in all patients and in patients assigned to the HR group, given the higher CS doses administered to this group. The effect of genotype is presented by odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI according to the best model, which, in all cases, was either dominant or recessive. Unadjusted p-values were reported. False discovery rate (FDR) [[23](#B23)] was also calculated to account for multiple testing corrections. For the significantly associated variants, multivariable logistic regression analysis was also performed to assess the effect of genotype while controlling for nongenetic covariates, including age, sex, CS type, treatment protocol, leukemia cell type and risk groups. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS statistical package (IL, USA), version 22.0. The Optimal Sequence Kernel Association test [[24](#B24)] was used in RStudio^©^ software for rare variants associations.

## Results

Association analysis of 13 GWAS SNPs with ON ([Table 1](#T1)) revealed a significant association of one polymorphism, G>A substitution (rs6797178) in *SOX14* gene, according to the recessive model. Lower frequency of AA genotype was noted among affected patients as compared with nonaffected (0% vs. 11.8%; p = 0.03; [Table 1](#T1)). However, the association did not sustain correction for multiple testing. The analyses of 43 exonic variants in GWAS genes ([Supplementary Table 4](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2019-0087/suppl_file/pgs-20-1189-s2.pdf)) identified in HR patients, significant associations of 3 SNPs in *ACP1/SHY3L1* locus, of which two remained significant after correction for multiple testing with FDR lower than 15% (rs2306060 and rs2290911). Associated SNP belong to the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block in which rs2306060 and rs22909115 are in complete LD with 3 other variations (rs11553746, rs7595075 and rs79716074, [Figure 1](#F1)). All five SNPs were further genotyped in entire QcALL and all were associated with ON in HR patients according to the recessive model ([Table 2](#T2)). For example, the frequency of TT genotype of rs11553746 C>T was 35.7% versus 8.3% in cases with and without ON respectively (p = 0.009; [Table 2](#T2)), resulting in higher risk of ON for TT genotype (OR: 6.2; 95% CI: 1.8–21.6). The rs11553746 C>T polymorphism was also tested in multivariable models; TT genotype and the use of DXM were both associated with an increased risk of ON in patients assigned to HR group (OR: 9.1; 95% CI 2.1–39.1; p = 0.003, OR: 6.2; 95% CI: 1.6–24.3, p = 0.01 respectively; [Table 3](#T3)).

DFCI protocols (87-01, 91-01, 95-01 and 00-01) are recoded from 1 to 4 starting from the most recent protocol.

The rs11553746 was further genotyped in the replication cohort and association with ON was noted for *T* allele carriers when all patients of that cohort were analyzed (p = 0.04, [Figure 2](#F2)).

Among five SNPs in LD which were associated with ON, the G allele of the rs79716074 *A>G* defines haplotype **B* of functional *ACP1*A/*B/*C* alleles ([Figure 3](#F3)) [[25](#B25)]. Given that the *GG* genotype of this SNP was associated with ON ([Table 2](#T2)), there was also an association of the resulting **B*B* diplotype,

rs11553742 splicing variant and rs79716074 missense variant defines ACP1*A/*B/*C alleles. rs79716074 defines allele *B and is one of the SNPs in linkage disequilibrium associated with osteonecrosis in this study. Frequency of each allele in Quebec childhood acute lymploblastic leukemia cohort is indicated.

The rs11553746 (and other related SNPs) were not in complete LD with previously identified GWAS SNPs in *ACP1/SHY3L1* ([Figure 1](#F1)) [[16](#B16)]. The rs11553746 (and other SNPs in LD) or occurrence of ON did not correlate with event free survival (data not shown).

Analysis of rare variants in GWAS genes identified association of collapsed variants in *SOX14* and *EBF1* genes (p = 0.03 and 0.02 respectively; [Supplementary Table 5](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2019-0087/suppl_file/pgs-20-1189-s2.pdf)). However, in both cases, FDR was higher than 15% and they were not further analyzed in the replication group.

## Discussion

Here we investigated previously reported top-ranking GWAS *loci* of ON as well as other variants located in the same genes for their influence on development of this complication in childhood ALL patients treated with DFCI protocols. Although originally reported GWAS SNPs in *ACP1* gene (and in *SHY3L1* in close proximity) were not replicated, several variants in the same locus were associated with ON. The association was maintained in replication cohort. Among five SNPs in LD, two are interesting from functional perspective; the rs11553746 C>T, which depending on mRNA isoform, is either synonymous (Asp45Asp) or missense leading to *ACP1* Thr95Ile replacement and the rs79716074 A>G variation that defines **B* haplotype of *ACP1* gene. *ACP1* controls the synthesis of cytosolic low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase [[26](#B26)], which is a key regulator in many cellular processes, including regulation of growth factors and cellular adhesion [[25](#B25),[27](#B27),[28](#B28)]. Two different isoenzymes that arise through alternative splicing have been described and based on electrophoretic mobility are defined as ‘fast’ (F) and ‘slow’ (S). Alternative splicing is influenced by the presence of 3 codominant **A, *B* and **C* alleles [[29](#B29)]. The rs79716074, which defines allele **B*, is a missense Glu106Arg variant, whereas rs11553742, defining allele **C*, alters motif recognized by splicing factors SRp40 and SRp55 [[30](#B30)]. Allele **B* and **C* are associated with higher levels of F and S isoform, respectively [[25](#B25)]. *ACP1* alleles have been associated with susceptibility to several diseases, such as inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, cancer growth and metastatic bone cancer [[26](#B26),[31](#B31)]. The pathogenesis of CS-induced bone disease (in ALL patients and beyond) is thought to arise from an increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes and prolongation of the osteoclasts lifespan [[32](#B32)]. CS excess causes overproduction of reactive oxygen species [[32](#B32)] and may modulate vascular responsiveness to vasoactive substances leading to apoptosis of endothelial cells. CS were also reported to elevate the level of adipogenesis, leading to fat hypertrophy in the bone marrow [[32](#B32)]. *ACP1* contribution to ON can be linked to its role as an important signaling molecule in osteoblast biology and bone formation [[33](#B33)] and its expression/activity, which is modulated during osteoblastic differentiation in response to the redox status of the cells [[33](#B33)]. In regard to *ACP1* isoforms, it has been shown that *ACP1* increases osteoclastic differentiation likely at the expense of the F isoform [[34](#B34)], whose highest concentration was reported for **B* allele [[25](#B25)]. F isoform may also have a specific role in the regulation of quantity of adipose tissue [[35](#B35)], whereby higher F levels were associated with higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia and high cholesterol levels [[36](#B36)].

In conclusion, we confirmed the implication of *ACP1* locus in the development of ON in childhood ALL patients. We did not confirm the association of the same SNP(s) in this gene, as in original GWAS of ON in childhood ALL [[16](#B16)]. This might be due to difference in population studied (GWAS was performed in population of mixed ancestry), reflected by different minor allele frequency and resulting LD pattern, difference in the treatment protocol relative to corticosteroid type, cumulative dose or administration schedule and limited sample size of our study. These differences along with the wide range of SNPs might have also contributed to the lack of association noted for other studied genes. Possible implication (not maintained after corrections for multiple testing) was nevertheless noted for *SOX14* and *EBF1* genes, which warrant further attention.

This study identified potential causal SNP in *ACP1* gene that can through the influence on F isoform level and resulting pathophysiological mechanisms, contribute to the development of ON, at least in patients of European ancestry treated with DFCI protocols.
