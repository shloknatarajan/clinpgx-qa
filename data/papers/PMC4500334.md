## Abstract

**Aims:** 
Genetic factors, notably CYP2B6 516G→T [rs3745274] and 983T→C [rs28399499], explain much of the interindividual variability in efavirenz pharmacokinetics, but data from Africa are limited. We characterized relationships between genetic polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz concentrations in HIV-infected Black South African adults and children.

**Methods:** 
Steady-state mid-dosing interval efavirenz concentrations were measured. We genotyped 241 polymorphisms in genes potentially relevant to efavirenz metabolism and transport, including ABCB1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, NR1I2 and NR1I3.

**Results:** 
Among 113 participants (59 adults and 54 children), minor allele frequencies for CYP2B6 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15582C→T [rs4803419] were 0.36, 0.07, and 0.09, respectively. Based on composite CYP2B6 15582/516/983 genotype, there were 33 extensive metabolizer, 62 intermediate metabolizer and 18 slow metabolizer genotypes. Median (IQR) mid-dose efavirenz concentrations were 1.44 (1.21–1.93) µg ml–1, 2.08 (1.68–2.94) µg ml–1 and 7.26 (4.82–8.34) µg ml–1 for extensive, intermediate and slow metabolizers, respectively. In univariate analyses, a model that included composite genotype best predicted efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.28, 95% CI 0.21, 0.35, P = 2.4 × 10–11). Among individual CYP2B6 polymorphisms, 516G→T best predicted efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.22, 95% CI 0.13, 0.30, P = 1.27 × 10−6). There was also associations with 983T→C (β = 0.27, 95% CI 0.10, 0.44, P = 0.002) and 15582C→T (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.22, P = 0.04). Associations were consistent in adults and children. No other polymorphisms were independently associated with efavirenz concentrations.

**Conclusions:** 
Composite CYP2B6 genotype based on CYP2B6 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15582C→T best described efavirenz exposure in HIV-infected Black South African adults and children.

### Aims

Genetic factors, notably *CYP2B6* 516G→T [rs3745274] and 983T→C [rs28399499], explain much of the interindividual variability in efavirenz pharmacokinetics, but data from Africa are limited. We characterized relationships between genetic polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz concentrations in HIV-infected Black South African adults and children.

### Methods

Steady-state mid-dosing interval efavirenz concentrations were measured. We genotyped 241 polymorphisms in genes potentially relevant to efavirenz metabolism and transport, including *ABCB1*, *CYP2A6*, *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *NR1I2* and *NR1I3*.

### Results

Among 113 participants (59 adults and 54 children), minor allele frequencies for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15582C→T [rs4803419] were 0.36, 0.07, and 0.09, respectively. Based on composite *CYP2B6* 15582/516/983 genotype, there were 33 extensive metabolizer, 62 intermediate metabolizer and 18 slow metabolizer genotypes. Median (IQR) mid-dose efavirenz concentrations were 1.44 (1.21–1.93) µg ml^–1^, 2.08 (1.68–2.94) µg ml^–1^ and 7.26 (4.82–8.34) µg ml^–1^ for extensive, intermediate and slow metabolizers, respectively. In univariate analyses, a model that included composite genotype best predicted efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.28, 95% CI 0.21, 0.35, *P* = 2.4 × 10^–11^). Among individual *CYP2B6* polymorphisms, 516G→T best predicted efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.22, 95% CI 0.13, 0.30, *P* = 1.27 × 10^−6^). There was also associations with 983T→C (β = 0.27, 95% CI 0.10, 0.44, *P* = 0.002) and 15582C→T (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.22, *P* = 0.04). Associations were consistent in adults and children. No other polymorphisms were independently associated with efavirenz concentrations.

### Conclusions

Composite *CYP2B6* genotype based on *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15582C→T best described efavirenz exposure in HIV-infected Black South African adults and children.

## Introduction

Efavirenz is extensively prescribed for HIV-1 infection worldwide. It is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 [1](#b1). Analyses with AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocol 5097s first showed that the non-synonymous polymorphism *CYP2B6* 516G→T (rs3745274) was strongly associated with increased plasma efavirenz exposure [2](#b2). Many studies have since replicated this association [3](#b3)–[17](#b17). The *CYP2B6* 516G→T polymorphism is more frequent with African ancestry than with European ancestry [18](#b18), which largely explains the greater mean plasma efavirenz concentrations reported among populations of African descent [19](#b19),[20](#b20). A less frequent *CYP2B6* polymorphism, 983T→C (rs28399499), also predicts increased plasma efavirenz exposure [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21)–[25](#b25). The *CYP2B6* 983 C allele is found almost exclusively with African ancestry, where it is still much less frequent than 516G→T [18](#b18). A recent genome-wide association study of White, Black and Hispanic adults in the United States showed that a third polymorphism, *CYP2B6* 15582C→T (rs4803419), was also associated with estimated efavirenz trough concentrations independent of 516G→T and 983T→C [26](#b26).

Additional *CYP2B6* polymorphisms suggested to affect *CYP2B6* activity have been extremely infrequent [21](#b21),[27](#b27),[28](#b28), or have not predicted plasma efavirenz exposure [2](#b2),[29](#b29),[30](#b30). Polymorphisms in genes beyond *CYP2B6* reported to affect efavirenz pharmacokinetics include *CYP2A6* [7](#b7),[30](#b30), *CYP3A5* [2](#b2), *UGT2B7* [7](#b7) and *CAR* [31](#b31), *CYP3A5* [2](#b2), *UGT2B7* [7](#b7) and *CAR* [31](#b31), although results have been inconsistent. The genome-wide associations study noted above did not identify additional associations in or beyond *CYP2B6* [26](#b26).

Data from Africa have repeatedly replicated the association between efavirenz exposure and both *CYP2B6* 516G→T [7](#b7)–[17](#b17),[24](#b24),[25](#b25) and *CYP2B6* 983T→C [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21),[24](#b24),[25](#b25), but data from Africa beyond these two polymorphisms are limited. We characterized relationships between genetic polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz concentrations among HIV-infected adults and children in South Africa.

## Methods

### Study Participants

We included adults and children who had been enrolled in two observational studies. In the adult study, adults from the public sector antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme were enrolled in a cross sectional study to evaluate associations between plasma efavirenz concentrations and metabolic complications. Eligible participants were on efavirenz-based therapy for at least 1 month, and were excluded for renal or hepatic disease, active opportunistic infections, known diabetes or dyslipidaemia, self-reported non-adherence, pregnancy, or concomitant drugs with the potential to interact with efavirenz.

In the paediatric study, African children (aged 3–15 years and weighing more than 10 kg) on efavirenz-based therapy with or without rifampicin-based anti-tuberculosis therapy were enrolled to evaluate the effect of rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy on efavirenz concentrations [32](#b32). The present analyses included only data from children who were not receiving rifampicin.

All participants self-identified as Black. This study complied with the Helsinki Declaration, was approved by institutional review boards for each site, and participants or their parents gave written informed consent or assent.

### Characterization of Genetic Polymorphisms

Human DNA was extracted from buffy coats using the Wizard® Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A total of 241 polymorphisms (70 in *ABCB1* (also called *MDR1*), 22 in *CYP2A6*, 54 in *CYP2B6*, one in *CYP2C19*, 23 in *CYP3A4*, one in *CYP3A5*, 31 in *NR1I2* (also called *PXR*) and 39 in *NR1I3* (also called *CAR*)) were successfully genotyped in the Vanderbilt DNA Resources Core using MassARRAY® iPLEX Gold (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, California, USA). Our strategy for genotyping was as follows: For *CYP2B6*, *ABCB1* and *NR1I2* we tagged each entire gene using SeattleSNPs [33](#b33) using a cosmopolitan strategy across populations (Yoruba, Asian, African-American, European-American and Hispanic) with a 5% allelic frequency cut-off, a 0.80 threshold for *r*^2^, 85% data convergence for tagging polymorphisms and 70% data convergence for clustering. For *CYP2B6* we included 5 kB in each 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR), and for *ABCB1* and *NR1I2* 20 kB in each UTR. For *CYP2B6*, additional polymorphisms of interest (but that were not extremely infrequent) were added based on a previous report [3](#b3), as were polymorphisms with at least 5% allelic frequency in 20 kB of the 5’ UTR identified using Ensembl Genome Browser [34](#b34) and upstream polymorphisms possibly associated with CYP2B6 expression [35](#b35). We also included *ABCB1* 3435C→T (rs1045642) and 2677G/T/A (rs2032582), *CYP2C19* 681G→A (rs4244285) and *CYP3A5* 6986A→G (rs776746). (*CYP2C19* 681G→A was part of the already designed multiplex assay, but was not expected to affect efavirenz exposure). The final Sequenom assay design is available upon request. Laboratory personnel with no knowledge of clinical data performed genotyping. Ample duplicate and blank assays were included to assure validity. Polymorphisms were excluded for genotyping efficiency less than 95%.

Composite *CYP2B6* 15582/516/983 genotypes were assigned as follows: extensive metabolizer genotype (15582CC-516GG-983TT or 15582CT-516GG-983TT), intermediate metabolizer genotype (15582TT-516GG-983TT, 15582CC-516GT-983TT, 15582CC-516GG-983CT, 15582CT-516GT-983TT or 15582CT-516GG-983CT) and slow metabolizer genotype (15582CC-516TT-983TT, 15582CC-516GT-983CT or 15582CC-516GG-983CC) [26](#b26).

### Efavirenz Concentrations

Plasma efavirenz concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MC/MS) as previously described [36](#b36). Intraday and interday precision ranged from 1.2 to 4.1% and 2.5 to 5.3%, respectively. The calibration range was linear from 0.1 to 15 µg ml^–1^ and accuracy ranged from 95.2 to 104.6%. Several samples were obtained on the same day from each participant. Sampling times were not pre-specified, and time of prior dose was by self-report for adults, and was reported by caregivers for children. We excluded efavirenz data from samples obtained less than 10 h or greater than 20 h post-dose, or before 1 month of efavirenz therapy, and from children within 1 month after discontinuing rifampicin. An average of measured concentrations was used when multiple samples from the same participant were obtained. The repeated measurements of efavirenz concentrations were used in exploratory multilevel mixed effects (MLME) analyses.

### Statistical Analysis

The pharmacokinetic data were not normally distributed. Therefore, a logarithmic (log_10_) transformation was done. Genetic associations with log_10_ transformed average efavirenz concentrations were analyzed by univariate linear regression. The tri-allelic *ABCB1* rs2032582 was analyzed as A *vs*. not A, G *vs*. not G and T *vs*. not T. We also performed analyses adjusting for *CYP2B6* 516G→T. All tests used a 5% two-sided significance level. Analyses were performed with PLINK version 1.07 ([http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/∼purcell/plink/](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/)). Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple testing [37](#b37). For polymorphisms previously associated with efavirenz pharmacokinetics, the threshold to carry forward into subsequent linear regression models was *P* = 0.01.

Haplotypic blocks were defined using the D’ confidence intervals method in Haploview [38](#b38) and haplotype phases were inferred using the standard E-M algorithm in PLINK [39](#b39). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) plots and values were generated with Haploview ([www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/](http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/)).

The multilevel mixed effect regression model performed in Stata 11 [40](#b40), which accounted for within individual correlations, evaluated associations of efavirenz concentrations with the three polymorphisms adjusted for effects of time post-dose and age group.

## Results

### Study Participant Characteristics

Pharmacokinetic data were available from 152 participants, of whom 113 with sufficient DNA for successful genotyping are included in the present analyses. Among 59 adults, median age was 38 years (range 20 to 59 years), median weight was 65.9 kg (range 45.2 to 104.5 kg) and 45 (76%) were female. Of participants with available plasma HIV-1 RNA data, values were <400 copies ml^–1^ in 78% of adults and in 87% of children. Characteristics of study participants are presented in Table[1](#tbl1).

### Genetic Polymorphisms

Among the 113 participants, 241 polymorphisms were successfully genotyped, of which 18 were monomorphic (i.e. no minor alleles). Each of the remaining 223 polymorphisms was in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium based on a Bonferroni adjusted *P* value threshold of 0.0002; six had unadjusted *P* values <0.05 (*NR1I3* rs4489574, *P* = 0.002, *NR1I2* rs2461817, *P* = 0.021, *ABCB1* rs17149792, *P* = 0.024, *NR1I3* rs2502815, *P* = 0.026, *ABCB1* rs10264990, *P* = 0.035 and *CYP3A4* rs28539499, *P* = 0.036). Minor allele frequencies for the 241 polymorphisms are in Supplemental Material Table [S1](#sd1).

### Genetic Associations with Efavirenz Concentrations

The median plasma mid-dose efavirenz concentration was 2.03 µg ml^–1^ (interquartile range 1.46–3.46 µg ml^–1^). In univariate linear regression models, composite *CYP2B6* 15582/516/983 genotype was most strongly associated with efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.28, 95% CI 0.21, 0.35, *P* = 2.4 × 10^–11^). Of the 223 polymorphisms, 15 (all in *CYP2B6*) were associated with efavirenz concentrations at *P* < 0.01. These include *CYP2B6* 516G→T (β = 0.22, 95% CI 0.13, 0.30, *P* = 1.3x10^–6^) and eight polymorphisms in LD with 516G→T at *r*^2^>0.6. The minor allele frequency of *CYP2B6* 516G→T was 0.36, with 43 (38.1%) homozygous for GG, 58 (51.3%) heterozygous for GT and 12 (10.6%) homozygous for TT. The minor allele frequency of *CYP2B6* 983T→C was 0.07, with 98 (86.7%) homozygous for TT, 15 (13.3%) heterozygous for TC and none homozygous for CC. The minor allele frequency of *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was 0.09, with 94 (83.2%) homozygous for CC, 18 (15.9%) heterozygous for TC and one (0.9%) homozygous for TT.

To identify independent predictors of efavirenz concentrations we performed multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T. By this analysis, the only additional polymorphism associated at *P* < 0.01 was *CYP2B6* 983T→C (β = 0.37, 95% CI 0.23, 0.52, *P* = 2.78 × 10^-6^). In an analysis that adjusted for both *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, no additional polymorphism was associated with efavirenz concentrations at *P* < 0.01, the lowest *P* value being for *CYP2B6* rs28723610 (β = 0.21, 95% CI 0.04, 0.38, *P* = 0.013). There was no apparent association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T (β = 0.06, 95% CI –0.06, 0.19, *P* = 0.34). Final multivariable linear regression models are presented in Table[2](#tbl2).

Table 2 Caption: Genetic associations with efavirenz concentrations in all 113 participants.

In the above analyses, two individuals had extreme outlier efavirenz values. One individual, a 41-year-old woman with a body mass index of 22 kg m^–2^, had three concentrations of 28.1, 28.2 and 32.3 µg ml^–1^ (mean 29.30 µg ml^–1^). She was homozygous for 15582CC, 516GG and 983TT. One individual, a 7-year-old boy weighing 21 kg at a height of 114 cm, had three concentrations of 0.32, 0.29 and 0.28 µg ml^–1^ (mean 0.30 µg ml^–1^). He was heterozygous for 15582CT and homozygous for 516GG and 983TT. To characterize associations with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T further, we performed *post hoc* sensitivity analyses after censoring the two outliers. In such analyses, adjusting for both 516G→T and 983T→C, five more *CYP2B6* polymorphisms in weak LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T showed trends toward association with low efavirenz concentrations in unadjusted analyses (Table[3](#tbl3)), and *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was now associated with efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.22, *P* = 0.04) (Table[3](#tbl3)). Relationships between genotypes and efavirenz concentrations in all individuals are presented in Figure[1A](#fig01).

Relationships between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and log10 transformed efavirenz concentrations in adults and children. Efavirenz concentrations were determined as described in Methods. Relationships with CYP2B6 polymorphisms and log10 efavirenz concentrations are shown in all participants (A), adults (B) and children (C). On the x-axis, CYP2B6 haplotypes represent (in order) CYP2B6 15582C→T (CC, CT, TT), 516G→T (GG, GT, TT) and 983T→C (TT, TC). Number per CYP2B6 haplotype is also displayed. On the y-axis, the log10 transformed efavirenz concentrations are displayed. On each graph, each marker represents a different participant. Horizontal bars are medians and interquartile ranges. Median values are above

In the final multivariable model, each 516 T allele was associated with a 31% increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.27, *P*<0.0001), each 983 C allele with a 46% increase (β = 0.38, *P*<0.0001), and each 15582 T allele with a 6% increase (β = 0.06, *P* = 0.340). These three polymorphisms explained 34% of variance in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations. A model that included only *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C also explained 34% of variance in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations. Univariate linear regression models for each individual polymorphism explained 19%, 8% and only 0.59% of variance for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T, respectively.

In the *post hoc* sensitivity analysis that censored the two outlier participants, each 516 T allele was associated with a 33% increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.29, *P* < 0.0001), each 983 C allele with a 48% increase (β = 0.39, *P* < 0.0001) and each 15582 T allele with a 12% increase (β = 0.12, *P* = 0.04), which together explained 45% of variance. A model that included only *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C explained 43% of variance. Univariate linear regression models for each individual polymorphism explained 24%, 10% and only 0.02% of variance for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T, respectively.

We also performed separate analyses among children and adults. Linear regression results for children and adults are shown in Supplemental Material Table [S2](#sd2) and S3, respectively. In both analyses, *CYP2B6* 516G→T (and polymorphisms in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T) and 983T→C were strongly associated with log_10_ efavirenz concentrations. In unadjusted analyses, there was no association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T. In adults, unadjusted analyses revealed that *NR1I2* rs9847782 had the greatest effect size (β = 0.37, 95% CI 0.11, 0.62, *P* = 7.3 × 10^−3^), which was no longer apparent when one outlier was excluded (a 41-year-old with very high efavirenz concentrations and homozygous for *NR1I2* rs9847782TT). Interestingly, in children only, when the outlier with an exceptionally low log_10_ efavirenz concentration was excluded (a 7-year-old heterozygous for *CYP2B6* 15582 CT), *CYP2B6* 15582C→T showed a trend towards significance when adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C (β = 0.08, 95% CI 0.005, 0.30, *P* = 0.05). Relationships between genotypes and efavirenz concentrations in children and adults are presented in Figure[1B](#fig01) and Figure[1C](#fig01), respectively.

As there were clinical differences (including age and sampling time post-dose) between adults and children in our analyses, we explored multilevel mixed effects modelling using each measured efavirenz value separately in each participant, rather than the mean of concentration values. We fitted a hierarchical model that predicted log_10_ efavirenz concentrations as a function of 1) fixed effects of age group, time after dose, *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T and 2) random effects for the individual to account for within individual correlations. In this model, compared with individuals in the lowest concentration stratum (i.e. 15582CC-516GG-983TT, β = 0.58), when time after dose and age group were held constant, homozygosity for *CYP2B6* 516TT was associated with an 0.64 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (2.9-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations), heterozygosity for *CYP2B6* 983TC with an 0.36 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (2.1-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations), heterozygosity for *CYP2B6* 516GT with an 0.19 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (1.5-fold increase in measured concentrations), homozygosity for *CYP2B6* 15582TT with an 0.21 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (1.4-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations) and heterozygosity for *CYP2B6* 15582CT with an 0.06 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (1.2-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations).

### Linkage Disequilibrium Between CYP2B6 Polymorphisms

To understand relationships between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms associated with efavirenz concentrations better, we considered LD. In the first model, without adjusting for any polymorphisms, two groups of polymorphisms were associated with efavirenz concentrations (Table[2](#tbl2)), the first comprising eight polymorphisms in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T and with minor alleles associated with higher efavirenz concentrations (i.e. positive β values), and the second comprising five polymorphisms in weaker LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T and with minor alleles trending towards an association with lower efavirenz concentrations (i.e. negative β values). In the second analyses, which adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, none of the above 13 polymorphisms remained associated with efavirenz concentrations, with only *CYP2B6* 983T→C becoming significant, with a greater effect size and even lower *P* value (Table[2](#tbl2)). No polymorphisms were in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 983T→C. In the third analyses, which adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, no other polymorphisms were associated with efavirenz concentrations (Table[2](#tbl2)). Linkage disequilibrium between the *CYP2B6* polymorphisms is shown in Figure[2](#fig02). We only show polymorphisms with *P* values < 0.01 on unadjusted analyses, as well as *CYP2B6* 15582C→T and *CYP2B6* -2320T→C (rs7251950) polymorphisms. The latter was included because it was reported to be in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T in other populations [26](#b26). In our cohort, it was in weak LD with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T (*r*^2^ =0.19).

### Previously Reported Associations Beyond CYP2B6

Polymorphisms in genes beyond *CYP2B6* reported to affect efavirenz pharmacokinetics include *ABCB1* [12](#b12),[41](#b41), *CYP2A6* [7](#b7),[30](#b30), *CYP3A5* [2](#b2), *UGT2B7* [7](#b7) and *CAR* [42](#b42),[43](#b43). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed no associations beyond *CYP2B6* and the results are shown in Supplemental Material Table S4. The minor allele frequencies are also displayed. The *CYP2A6* rs1801272 was monomorphic in our cohort. With only 18 participants with *CYP2B6* slow metabolizer genotypes, we were unable to replicate a previously reported association with *CYP2A6* -48T→G (rs28399433) in this group (*P* = 0.89).

## Discussion

Efavirenz is one of the most extensively prescribed medications worldwide for HIV-1 infection, and multiple previous studies have associated *CYP2B6* 516 G→T [2](#b2)–[13](#b13) and *CYP2B6* 983 T→C [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21)–[25](#b25), with increased plasma efavirenz concentrations. Our study replicated these associations in Black South Africans. In addition, we showed for the first time that *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was associated with plasma efavirenz concentrations in Black South Africans, which had previously only been reported for efavirenz in one study from the United States [26](#b26). In univariate analyses, a model that included composite genotype best predicted efavirenz concentrations. These associations were consistent in adults and children. An association between *CYP2B6* 15582C→T and slower plasma drug clearance has also been reported among Cambodians for the CYP2B6 substrate nevirapine [44](#b44), further supporting the validity of our finding. We did not find significant associations beyond *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T. Although one analysis suggested an association with *NR1I2* rs9847782, this was no longer apparent after excluding one outlier, suggesting a spurious association. Our study also provided information regarding minor allele frequencies for *ABCB1*, *CYP2A6*, *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *NR1I2* and *NR1I3* polymorphisms in a South African population.

We observed somewhat lower efavirenz concentrations in children, which is probably explained by the higher clearance in children compared with adults relative to their size [45](#b45). Although WHO weight-based dosing in children is intended to achieve efavirenz concentrations similar to those in adults with fixed dosing, high prevalence of low efavirenz concentrations in children has been observed in a South African population similar to ours, and has been attributed to the current weight based WHO guidelines [46](#b46). We assessed associations between polymorphisms and efavirenz concentrations separately in adults and children. In both children and adults, *CYP2B6* 516G→T had the strongest overall association with efavirenz concentrations, although *CYP2B6* 983T→C had the greatest effect size per allele. The association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T could not be demonstrated in adults and children analyzed separately, possibly due to smaller samples sizes.

In the present analysis, minor allele frequencies of *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15882C→T were 0.36, 0.07 and 0.09, respectively. In the multivariate regression model including all three polymorphisms, *CYP2B6* 983T→C had the greatest magnitude of effect on log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.38 for 983T→C, β = 0.27 for 516G→T, β = 0.06 for 15882C→T), but due to lower frequency only explained approximately 8% of variance in univariate analysis *vs*. 19% for 516G→T, and negligible effect for 15882C→T. In sensitivity analyses that excluded two individuals with extreme outlier efavirenz concentrations, the variance explained by all three polymorphisms increased from 34% to 45%.

Our analyses included two participants with extreme outlier efavirenz concentrations, and in neither of the cases could we identify an explanation. Dose-to-sampling times were reported to be within the 10–20 h mid-dose interval window and there were multiple efavirenz determinations from each participant. However, non-adherence in the participant with the lowest concentrations cannot be excluded. Sensitivity analyses that excluded these two participants allowed a significant association between *CYP2B6* 15882C→T and log_10_ efavirenz concentrations to be demonstrated. This same approach to censor outliers was used by Bertrand *et al*. [44](#b44) and highlights the critical importance of minimizing phenotype misclassification for detecting true associations.

Our primary analyses considered genetic associations with log_10_-transformed efavirenz concentrations. Where data from multiple samples were available from the same individual, the time adjusted average was used. We also employed the hierarchical model to consider repeated measurements taking into account variation on fixed (*CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582 C→T genotypes, age group, time after dose) and random (individual) effects. The advantage of this analysis is that it provides more information about the contribution of genotype to the increase in efavirenz concentrations when all other parameters are equal.

Previous studies from Africa have replicated the association between *CYP2B6* 516G→T and plasma efavirenz exposure, including studies of patients from Zimbabwe [8](#b8),[9](#b9),[13](#b13), South Africa [10](#b10),[11](#b11),[17](#b17),[25](#b25), Ghana [7](#b7),[24](#b24), Uganda [12](#b12),[13](#b13), Tanzania [14](#b14),[15](#b15), Rwanda [16](#b16) and Ethiopia [14](#b14). Multiple studies of patients from Africa have also shown the association with 983T→C [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21),[24](#b24),[25](#b25). Data for association beyond *CYP2B6* are limited. A study of patients in Ghana found associations with *CYP2A6* and *UGT2B7* polymorphisms [7](#b7), but a subsequent study of patients in Ghana did not replicate independent associations with these polymorphisms [24](#b24).

The association between *CYP2B6* 15582C→T and plasma efavirenz concentrations was first discovered and replicated in a genome-wide association study from the United States [26](#b26). This polymorphism was also associated with increased plasma efavirenz concentrations in Cambodians receiving concomitant antituberculosis therapy with isoniazid and rifampicin [47](#b47). In Cambodians receiving nevirapine, *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was also associated with decreased plasma nevirapine clearance, as was *CYP2B6* -2320T→C (rs7251950), which was in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T in that study [44](#b44). In contrast, in the present study *CYP2B6* -2320T→C was in weak LD with 15582C→T (r^2^ = 0.19) and was not associated with efavirenz concentrations. In addition, Lamba *et al.* reported that *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was associated with lower hepatic CYP2B6 expression in females [48](#b48). In the present study, while the association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was only significant in analyses that included both adults and children and with outliers excluded (to provide a cleaner phenotype), this association was highly likely to be valid considering the above reports in non-African populations. Additional studies on other populations will help to replicate and refine this association further.

This study increases our understanding of efavirenz pharmacogenetics and has potential clinical implications. Because many patients (especially those with intermediate and slow metabolizer *CYP2B6* genotypes) have plasma efavirenz exposure in considerable excess of what is needed to control HIV-1 replication, there has been interest in alternative dosing strategies for efavirenz. The ENCORE1 study evaluated routinely initiating a lower dose of efavirenz (400 mg rather than 600 mg) in adults without genetic testing, and showed somewhat improved tolerability and no apparent loss of antiviral efficacy [49](#b49). If that approach is to be translated into clinical practice, the present study suggests that the group at greatest risk for subtherapeutic efavirenz concentrations will be patients who lack polymorphisms at all three loci (i.e. *CYP2B6* 516GG-983TT-15582CC). Only by genotyping for all three polymorphism can this group be defined. Consideration has also been given to using genetic testing to individualize better efavirenz dosing. This may be most practical in paediatrics, where individualized weight-based dosing is already used. In this setting, testing for polymorphisms at all three loci will allow the most precise dosing.

The present study considered combined analyses involving both adults and children, as well as subgroup analyses involving adults and children separately. A potential concern with combined analyses is the different approach to dosing efavirenz, with adults receiving a uniform dose and children receiving a weight-based dose, which might offset the advantage of a larger sample size. Several considerations provided reassurance that combined analyses were not problematic, and improved our likelihood of finding true associations. First, associations with the known loss-of-function polymorphisms, *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, were far more significant in combined analyses than in subgroup analyses, suggesting that our ability to detect true associations was increased, not decreased, by combining groups. Second, the association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T only achieved significance in combined analyses. Third, the rationale for a weight-based dose in children was to approximate plasma exposure in adults, which reduces concern about combining groups.

There were limitations to the present study. Sample size limited our power to identify novel genetic associations for polymorphisms that were infrequent or had small effects, even with the dataset that included both adults and children. For example, assuming a standard deviation of 0.33 for log_10_ efavirenz concentration within each genotype group and a type II error of 0.2, we have 80% power for the following differences in pair-wise means homozygotes and heterozygotes: with 59 subjects and MAF = 0.1 a difference of 0.24 log_10_ (∼75% absolute), with 59 subjects and MAF = 0.3 a difference 0.19 log_10_ (∼55% absolute), with 113 subjects and MAF = 0.1 a difference of 0.17 log_10_ (∼50% absolute), with 113 subjects and MAF = 0.3 a difference of 0.14 log_10_ (∼40% absolute). Small sample size also limited our ability to test for interactions between *CYP2B6* genotype and age in children, although we did not anticipate such interactions. Because the dose of efavirenz was not observed, we could not be certain of dose sampling times.

In summary, the present study improves the understanding of genetic determinants of efavirenz plasma exposure in an African population, including adults and children. Studies of associations between efavirenz concentrations and polymorphisms in African populations should consider *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, and ideally also 15582C→T.
