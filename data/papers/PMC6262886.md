## Abstract

Chromosome 12q15 was identified in Genetic Epidemiology of Response Assessment (GERA) and replicated in Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) for its association with blood pressure (BP) response to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). However, the functional variant is unknown and we aimed to identify the likely functional variants through targeted sequencing. The chromosome 12q15 region was sequenced in 397 best and worst responders to HCTZ in PEAR (N=199) and GERA (N=198) hypertensive study participants. Logistic regression was used for the association analysis adjusting for age, gender, race and principal components 1 and 2. For validation, the significant SNP was tested for association with the change in systolic (ΔSBP) and diastolic BP (ΔDBP) post treatment in the entire PEAR (N=370) and GERA (N=570) cohorts. A novel missense polymorphism (G>A, Pro383Leu) in BEST3, rs61747221, was significantly associated with better HCTZ response (p=0.0021, OR=2.05). It was validated in the entire cohort of PEAR (ΔSBP: p=0.021, β=−1.60, ΔDBP: p=0.023, β=−1.08) and GERA (ΔSBP: p=0.028, β=−1.95, ΔDBP: p=0.032, β=−1.28). BEST3 encodes the calcium sensitive chloride channel in the vascular smooth muscle implicated in regulation of BP, especially in response to vasoconstrictors like angiotensin II. These results suggest that BEST3 is involved in the chronic BP lowering mechanism of thiazides and highlight its importance as a genetic predictor of the BP response to thiazide diuretics.

## Introduction:

Hydrochlorothiazide(HCTZ) is the most commonly prescribed thiazide in the US. However, there is inter-individual variability in blood pressure(BP) response to HCTZ, and genetics may contribute to this variability^1, 2^

Two pharmacogenomic studies from our laboratories – The Genetic Epidemiology of Response Assessment(GERA) and Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Anti-hypertensive Response(PEAR) have investigated the genetic markers associated with differential BP response to HCTZ treatment. GERA identified a three-nucleotide haplotype(rs317689/rs315135/rs7297610) present on chromosome12q15 that was significantly associated with better BP response to HCTZ treatment^3^ and was further replicated in the PEAR^4^. Even though these studies suggested the potential involvement of this novel region in the HCTZ mediated BP response, they did not identify any functional polymorphisms that could explain the mechanism underlying the association. Moreover, the mechanism of the novel genes identified in this region in BP regulation is not fully understood. With the goal of identifying the functional polymorphism associated with HCTZ drug response in the chromosome12 locus we performed targeted sequencing to capture all the polymorphisms in this region.

## Methods:

### Study design:

PEAR and GERA([clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) identifier:[NCT00246519](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00246519) and [NCT00005520](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00005520)) studies^5, 6^ were aimed at assessing the genomic variability attributed to BP following treatment with atenolol or HCTZ and the combination in PEAR and HCTZ in GERA. For both, participants underwent a washout period to re-establish hypertensive BPs before starting the drug treatment. Blood samples were collected, along with BP measurement at the end of washout(baseline) and following treatment with HCTZ (PEAR:9 weeks, GERA:4 weeks). The difference in the BP from baseline to post treatment was defined as delta systolic BP(ΔSBP) and delta diastolic BP(ΔDBP).

### PhaseI:

A total of 361 participants (119 European Americans(EA) and 242 African Americans(AA), from PEAR(n=196) and GERA(n=165), were selected based on the top and bottom quartiles of the distribution of the ΔDBP response to HCTZ such that half of the participants in PhaseI comprised of the best responders to HCTZ(cases) and the other half comprised of poor responders to HCTZ(controls). These participants were sequenced for chr12q15 locus (hg19 coordinates:69357185–70047375) that included *CPFS6*, *LYZ*, *YEATS4*, *FRS2*, *CCT2*, *LRRC10* and 3’ end of *BEST3*. Case-control association analysis was conducted in PLINK1.07^7,8^ using logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, race and principal components 1 and 2.

### PhaseII:

The candidate polymorphism identified through PhaseI sequencing was in the tail end of the targeted region, in *BEST3.* This gene had not been annotated at the time PhaseI sequencing was planned and only the 3’ distal part of this gene was captured. The PhaseII sequencing effort was undertaken to capture the entire *BEST3* and adjacent *RAB3IP* (hg19 coordinates:70,047,349–70216949) to insure no additional SNPs with stronger associations in this region were present. PhaseII included 397 participants (355 participants were in PhaseI with an additional 42 participants in PhaseII). Similar to Phase I, the 397 participants (154 EA and 243 AA) came from both PEAR(n=200) and GERA(n=197) consisting of responders (n=202) and non-responders (n=195). All the participants of PhaseII were genotyped for the candidate polymorphism identified in Phase I, for inclusion in the PhaseII analysis. Case-control association analysis like PhaseI was performed.

Detailed sequencing methods have been outlined in the [Supplementary Methods](#SD3).

### Validation:

The candidate polymorphism identified from PhaseI and PhaseII was further validated by genotyping the entire population of GERA(N=571) and PEAR(N=370) for the variant and testing for association with ΔSBP and ΔDBP. Analysis was performed in SAS9.4 using linear regression for ΔSBP and ΔDBP adjusting for the same covariates as before.

### In-silico analysis:

In-silico analysis that predicts the effect of variants on protein function using two bioinformatics tools – PROVEAN and SIFT([http://provean.jcvi.org/index.php](http://provean.jcvi.org/index.php)), was used to assess rs61747221.

## Results:

The clinical characteristics of PhaseI and PhaseII participants are described in [Table1](#T1). Association analysis for PhaseI revealed several SNPs to be associated with BP response to HCTZ([Table S1](#SD1)). To investigate functional variants, we further focused only on coding region variants([Table S2](#SD2)). No new functional variants were identified in LD with the originally discovered haplotype (rs317689/rs315135/rs7297610). However we did identify rs61747221, a missense variation in *BEST3*, which was the most significant potentially functional SNP associated with BP response to HCTZ in the PhaseI analysis (p-value=0.0021, OR=2.056, 95% confidence interval=1.298,3.286)([Figure1](#F1)). Post PhaseII sequencing, which captured the entire *BEST3 and RAB3IP,* a total of 108,853 variants were detected of which 3,349 were novel and classified as: stop gain/stop loss-1, frameshift-17, missense-133, synonymous-682, intronic-84,178, intergenic-9,574 and others including UTRs and ncRNAs-14,268.

In PhaseII, rs61747221 remained the most significant SNP in the region associated with HCTZ BP response (p-value=0.010, OR=1.76, confidence interval=1.131,2.752) ([Figure 1](#F1)). For further validation, we tested this association in the entire cohort of PEAR(N=370) and GERA (N=570) treated with HCTZ. Rs61747221 remained associated with BP response in PEAR (ΔSBP:p=0.021,β=−1.60mmHg, ΔDBP:p=0.023,β=−1.08mmHg) and GERA (ΔSBP:p=0.028,β=−1.95mmHg, ΔDBP:p=0.032,β=−1.28 mmHg). For assessing the magnitude of effect of rs61747221 on BP response, we grouped the carriers of the variant(AA+AG) together in a dominant model due to the low sample size of the homozygote variant group(Minor allele frequency=0.13). Rs61747221 was significantly associated with BP response in a dominant model as well (PEAR-ΔSBP: β=−1.96mmHg, ΔDBP: β=−1.39mmHg and GERA-ΔSBP: β=−2.24mmHg, ΔDBP: β=−1.46mmHg). A-allele carriers of rs61747221 had better BP response to HCTZ compared to the non-carriers in all analyses([Figure 2](#F2)). Furthermore, though PROVEAN predicted this variant as “tolerant” SIFT predicted this missense variant, rs61747221 to have an “intolerant/damaging” effect on BEST3 protein(SIFT prediction score=0.019).

The blood pressure responses are least square adjusted means that have been adjusted for baseline blood pressure levels, age, sex, race and principal components 1 and 2. The p-value represents the difference in the adjusted blood pressure means by genotype.

## Discussion:

With the aim of identifying the functional polymorphism in the previously identified chromosome12 locus, we undertook targeted resequencing of this region. We identified a novel missense SNP, rs61747221 in the *BEST3* that was significantly associated with better BP response to HCTZ treatment. Rs61747221 was not in LD with the original 3-SNP haplotype that was previously identified, thus the functional variation or mechanism underlying the association with this haplotype(rs317689/rs315135/rs7297610) remains unclear.

However, through the resequencing effort we did identify a novel missense variant rs61747221 in *BEST3*, which was the most significant association among the coding variants, associated with increased BP response in the PhaseI sequencing of the chr12q15 locus. Since only the distal 3’ region of *BEST3* was captured in PhaseI sequencing, PhaseII sequencing with an extended cohort of participants was undertaken, which captured *BEST3* and *RAB3IP* completely. Upon PhaseII analysis, rs61747221 was still the most significantly associated coding variant with HCTZ BP response. Further validation came with the successful documentation of the association between BP response and rs61747221 in the entire cohort of PEAR and GERA, when genotyped for this variant and analyzed for association with ΔSBP and ΔDBP. In each analysis the variant carriers had better BP response to the HCTZ versus the non-carriers.

Rs61747221(G>A) is a missense polymorphism in *BEST3* resulting in proline to leucine substitution at position 383(**c.1148C>T and p.Pro383Leu**). Bestrophin-3(BEST3) is a transmembrane protein that acts as a calcium-activated chloride channel^11, 12^ and is widely expressed in the heart, smooth muscle cells, endothelium, and kidney^13–16^. Studies have shown the involvement of calcium-activated chloride channels in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction^17–20^. Additionally, downregulation of *BEST3* is associated with a significant reduction in cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase^14^ which is associated with vascular smooth muscle relaxation via its effect on calcium-activated potassium channels^21, 22^. Interestingly, previous studies have hypothesized that thiazide diuretics chronic BP lowering mechanism might be mediated via the opening of the calcium-activated potassium channels^23^. Taken together, these data suggest that *BEST3* might be involved in the chronic BP lowering mechanism underlying thiazide diuretics via their effect on the vascular smooth muscle regulation. Rs61747221 is eQTL for *RAB3IP*(Heart_Atrial_Appendage,adrenal glands GTEx_v7)^24^ and may have an plausible role to play in the BP response to HCTZ. RAB3IP is a guanylyl exchange factor and has been reported to be downregulated in the prefrontal cortex of hypercholesteremic plus hypertensive rabbits^25^ and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of high altitude pulmonary hypertension susceptible cattle^26^. However no specific studies have so far implicated the involvement of this gene in BP regulation or related pathways.

We acknowledge that our study has limitations, primarily the lack of an independent replication cohort. However, rs61747221 is present in 1000G reference panel and to our knowledge all the previous GWAS studies aimed at determining genetic determinants of HCTZ BP response have used HAPMAPII reference panel which does not include this SNP^27–29^. This is possibly the reason why this SNP has not been reported by other GWAS’s and we were able to discover this association only through our deep sequencing efforts. We have, however, attempted to provide additional evidence in support of rs61747221 by validating this association in two larger cohorts albeit with some overlap in the patient population between discovery and validation. Furthermore, SIFT pathogenicity prediction predicts rs61747221 to have deleterious effect on BEST3 protein, further strengthening this association. However, this association though validated in a larger cohort needs to be tested for replication in an independent cohort. In conclusion, these results highlight the importance of *BEST3* and rs61747221 as a potential genetic marker associated with BP response to HCTZ and elucidation of the exact mechanism of *BEST3* and the underlying functional role of rs61747221 can help advance our current understanding of HCTZ mediated long term BP control.
