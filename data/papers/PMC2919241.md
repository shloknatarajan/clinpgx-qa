## Abstract

We characterized relationships between 22 polymorphisms in CYP2B6, ABCB1 and CYP3A5, plasma efavirenz exposure, and/or treatment responses in AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocols 384, A5095, and A5097s. A stepwise logistic regression procedure selected polymorphisms associated with reduced drug clearance adjusted for body mass index and composite CYP2B6 516/983 genotype. Competing risk methodology characterized relationships between selected polymorphisms and treatment responses. Association analyses involved 821 individuals (317 for pharmacokinetics, 643 for treatment response). Models that included CYP2B6 516/983 genotype best predicted pharmacokinetics. Slow metabolizer genotypes were associated with increased central nervous system events among whites, and decreased virologic failure among blacks.

## INTRODUCTION

Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-1 infection, but some efavirenz recipients experience virologic failure [[1](#R1)] and/or central nervous system (CNS) symptoms [[2](#R2)]. Efavirenz is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6. In analyses involving 154 ACTG study 5097s participants (a 24-week substudy of A5095), *CYP2B6* 516G→T predicted increased plasma efavirenz exposure and CNS adverse experiences [[3](#R3)]. Subsequent studies have replicated this pharmacokinetics association (e.g. [[4](#R4)]). A less frequent *CYP2B6* polymorphism, 983T→C, also predicts plasma efavirenz exposure [[5](#R5), [6](#R6)]. Increased frequencies of 516G→T and 983T→C among blacks largely explain their greater mean plasma efavirenz concentrations. Additional *CYP2B6* polymorphisms suggested to affect *CYP2B6* activity have been extremely infrequent or have not predicted plasma efavirenz exposure [[7](#R7), [8](#R8)].

Polymorphisms in *ABCB1*, which encodes P-glycoprotein, may predict altered pharmacokinetics of some drugs, albeit not efavirenz [[3](#R3), [4](#R4)]. Two studies suggested that *ABCB1* 3435C→T predicted more favorable virologic responses to efavirenz-containing regimens [[4](#R4), [9](#R9)]. A weak association between *CYP3A5* 6986A→G and plasma efavirenz exposure has been suggested [[3](#R3)].

We evaluated whether 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms in *CYP2B6, ABCB1* and *CYP3A5* predicted plasma efavirenz exposure among participants in ACTG 384 and A5097s, and explored associations with treatment responses in A5095.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Study Participants

Treatment-naïve individuals were randomized to efavirenz-containing regimens in ACTG studies 384 [[10](#R10)] or A5095 [[1](#R1)](including its neurologic substudy A5097s [[2](#R2)]), with DNA obtained under protocol A5128.

This study comprises: 1) pharmacokinetic association analyses involving individuals with efavirenz assay data from ACTG 384 and A5097s, and 2) treatment outcome association analyses involving efavirenz recipients from A5095. Almost all participants in the pharmacokinetic association studies were included in two previous studies describing the association between *CYP2B6* 516G→T and efavirenz exposure [[3](#R3), [4](#R4)]. This study complied with the Helsinki Declaration, were approved by institutional review boards for each site, and subjects gave written informed consent.

Self-identified race/ethnicity categories “white, non-Hispanic”, “black, non-Hispanic”, and “Hispanic” are hereafter referred to as white, black, and Hispanic, respectively. Analyses are limited to whites, blacks, and Hispanics, which comprised 97% of participants.

### Identifying Genetic Polymorphisms

For pharmacokinetic association analyses, genotyping was by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Assay details are described in part elsewhere [[7](#R7), [11](#R11)]. We assayed 15 non-synonymous *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and an upstream untranslated region polymorphism. We also assayed *ABCB1* 1236C→T, 3435C→T, 2677G→T/A, two tagging intronic polymorphisms, and the *CYP3A5* 6986A→G loss-of-function polymorphism. For treatment response analyses, genotyping of selected polymorphisms was with ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Customized TaqMan™ assay IDs are available upon request.

### Pharmacokinetic Endpoint

Plasma efavirenz concenrations were assayed by HPLC at treatment weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24; sampling times were not pre-specified; time of prior dose was by patient report. Association analyses for efavirenz pharmacokinetics were based on raw efavirenz concentration data adjusted for dosing time using simulated efavirenz concentration-time curve percentiles, generated by pharmacokinetic model simulations [[12](#R12)]. Based on dosing time, each observed concentration was assigned to a percentile. For each subject the summary statistic for analysis was median of observed time-adjusted percentiles over up to 4 time-points for each individual. To minimize confounding by non-genetic factors and to assure steady state, we excluded individual efavirenz concentrations if beyond 24 hours post-dose or before at least 2 weeks of efavirenz, and subjects with only one evaluable efavirenz value or >30-percentile difference between any two concentrations. A binary outcome was defined for prediction modeling based on whether a subject's median time-adjusted percentile was ≥75^th^ percentile (corresponding to an efavirenz trough ≥2,350 ng/mL). Sensitivity analyses were performed using alternative percentile cut-offs and different tolerance ranges for intra-individual variability.

### Treatment Response Endpoint

Response endpoints included time from randomization to: 1) first grade 2 or higher CNS adverse event; 2) virologic failure (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels >200 copies/ml at or after week 16); 3) virologic failure with detectable efavirenz and/or lamivudine resistance; and 4) first plasma HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/mL. Scheduled A5095 study visits were at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 and every 8 weeks thereafter.

### Statistical Analyses

Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) expectations was evaluated using exact tests. Allelic frequencies were compared among ethnic groups with Fisher's exact tests.

Predictors of high efavirenz concentrations were assessed using logistic regression. All models adjusted for baseline body mass index (BMI) and then used a forward stepwise approach adding the polymorphism significant at P=0.05 and resulting in the largest change in likelihood. Sensitivity and specificity of resulting models were estimated assuming an estimated prediction probability of >75% as a positive response. We included *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C in all models as composite *CYP2B6* 516/983 genotype (hereafter called *516/983 genotype*) based on combined number of minor allele polymorphisms (0, extensive metabolizer; 1, intermediate metabolizer; 2, slow metabolizer).

For association analyses of treatment response, in the absence of a prior event, time to first CNS event was truncated at 24 weeks; other time to event endpoints were censored at study completion or discontinuation. Discontinuation of efavirenz was handled as a competing risk event; resistance-free virologic failure was an additional competing risk event for resistance-based endpoints. The cumulative incidence of each outcome was estimated over time by genotype and compared using Gray *k*-sample tests. Stepwise Cox regression models examined associations between each polymorphism and cause-specific hazard (using P<0.05 to determine whether polymorphisms enter or exit the model). With the exception of 516/983 genotype, genotype effects were introduced as a categorical covariate on 3 levels for 0, 1, or 2 polymorphic copies; 516/983 genotype was included as a binary covariate for 2 polymorphisms versus 0 or 1. Gender and BMI were included as candidate covariates as part of model selection. Analyses of virologic failure endpoints also included self-reported non-adherence (defined at week 12 as missing at least 1 dose during a 4-day recall) and thus included only subjects at risk at week 12.

All analyses were performed including all participants with adjustment for self-reported race/ethnicity, and separately among race/ethnicity subgroups. Since the inception of the present study, this same clinical trials population has undergone whole genome analysis for a separate project [[13](#R13)]. A sensitivity analysis that more rigorously adjusted for population stratification incorporated EIGENSTRAT values generated from whole genome data. Analyses were also repeated excluding individuals with any inconsistency in *CYP2B6* or *ABCB1* genotypes assayed by different methodologies.

All P-values are nominal and unadjusted for multiple comparisons. Analyses used SAS version 9.1 and SPLUS Version 6.2.

## RESULTS

### Study populations

Analyses comprised 831 subjects (19% female, 48% white, 34% black, 18% Hispanic). Mean baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.89 log_10_ copies/ml, and CD4+ T-cells 246/mm^3^. In the pharmacokinetic analysis cohort, of 16 *CYP2B6* polymorphisms assayed, only 516G→T, 785A→G, 983T→C, and 1459C→T were at greater than 5% frequency in at least one population ([Figure 1A](#F1)). There were no deviations from HWE among whites or Hispanics in either cohort. In the treatment response cohort there were deviations from HWE in blacks at *ABCB1* positions 3435 (P=0.01) and 2677 (P<0.001), which are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). Assay reliability at these two positions was confirmed among the 171 subjects with results obtained through both cohorts by both MALDI-TOF MS [[11](#R11)] and Taqman, among 154 individuals with results previously obtained using a different real-time PCR methodology [[3](#R3)], and among all treatment response participants by a different mass spectroscopy-based assay [[14](#R14)].

Panel A: Allelic frequencies among 489 participants genotyped for the pharmacokinetic analysis cohort. Panel B: Concentration-time relationships between plasma efavirenz concentrations and hours post-dose among all 489 participants. Some individuals contribute multiple datapoints to the figure. Bottom panels: Median time-adjusted concentration percentile ranks, stratified for composite CYP2B6 516/983 genotype, among the 317 pharmacokinetic modeling cohort participants, regardless of race/ethnicity. Each individual contributes a single datapoint to the figure. Separate displays generated for each race/ethnicity group were consistent (data not shown).

### Pharmacokinetic association analysis

The distribution of plasma efavirenz concentration-time values among 489 individuals with both efavirenz concentration and genotype data is presented in [Figure 1B](#F1). Pharmacokinetic modeling analyses were limited to 317 individuals meeting inclusion criteria. Relationships between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and concentration percentiles are shown in [Figure 1C](#F1). No independent associations were apparent for the other two frequent *CYP2B6* polymorphisms, 785A→G and 1459C→T. Low allelic frequencies limited our ability to test associations with other *CYP2B6* polymorphisms. One individual heterozygous for *CYP2B6* 136A→G (*11) with concomitant 516/983 intermediate metabolizer genotype had among the highest plasma efavirenz concentrations. There was no other apparent association with other *CYP2B6, ABCB1* or *CYP3A5* polymorphisms.

These descriptive findings were confirmed by modeling. Consistently across ethnicity groups, none of the additional polymorphisms improved prediction of high plasma efavirenz concentrations. Although the estimated model specificity including only 516/983 genotype and BMI was >90%, model sensitivity was only ~50%. This suggests that while 516/983 slow metabolizer genotype was highly predictive of efavirenz concentrations in the top 75^th^ percentile, the absence of this genotype could not reliably predict efavirenz concentrations below this cut-off. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses that adjusted for ACTG protocol, concomitant NRTI, nelfinavir use, used cut-points other than 75^th^ percentile for slow metabolizers, and alternative ranges of allowable intra-individual variability.

### Treatment Response Analyses

We next characterized relationships between genetic polymorphisms and responses to efavirenz-containing regimens among 643 participants in A5095, of whom 129 were also in the pharmacokinetic analyses. In addition to 516/983 genotype we evaluated *ABCB1* polymorphisms, as these might affect intracellular but not plasma drug concentrations.

Among whites there was some evidence of increased cumulative incidence of first CNS event associated with 516/983 slow metabolizer genotype (P=0.04). This was not apparent among blacks or Hispanics ([Figure 2A-D](#F2)). Among blacks the incidence of virologic failure over time was lower among those with 516/983 slow metabolizer genotype (P=0.02). This association was not apparent among whites or Hispanics ([Figure 2E-H](#F2)). No other associations between *CYP2B6* or *ABCB1* genotype and any other treatment response endpoints were observed overall and among whites, blacks, or Hispanics analyzed separately. No change in these results were observed in sensitivity analyses that incorporated EIGENSTRAT values, nor after excluding individuals with any inconsistency in *CYP2B6* or *ABCB1* genotypes assayed with different methodologies.

According to CYP2B6 516/983 genotype, within each panel the decreasing lines on the top display the estimates of cumulative probability of remaining on efavirenz; the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or higher CNS event (panels A-D) or virologic failure (panels E-H) by genotype are displayed at the base on the figure. The mid-area between the two curves represents the probability of remaining event free over time. P-values are given by Gray k-sample tests for comparing the cumulative incidence of competing risks. Solid lines represent extensive metabolizers; dashed lines intermediate metabolizers, and dotted lined slow metabolizers. Adverse events were graded using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS toxicity scale. AE, adverse events; VF, virologic failure.

To test for genotype-adherence interactions we applied a stepwise selection Cox proportional hazards regression model. This analysis confirmed results of univariate analyses. In particular, regarding virologic failure among blacks, no interaction between 516/983 genotype and non-adherence was detected (P=0.97).

## DISCUSSION

Numerous studies have associated *CYP2B6* 516 G→T with higher plasma efavirenz concentrations. We genotyped *CYP2B6* more extensively than almost every prior study, to assess whether additional non-synonymous variants better explain interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics and treatment response. We clearly establish that *CYP2B6* 983T→C improves the predictive ability of *CYP2B6* 516G→T for efavirenz pharmacokinetics, as suggested by smaller studies [[5](#R5), [6](#R6)]. In multivariable models, the ability of 516/983 genotype to predict efavirenz exposure was not improved by additional non-synonymous *CYP2B6* polymorphisms, or selected *ABCB1* and *CYP3A5* polymorphisms. Considerable interindividual variability remains unexplained by these two polymorphisms.

Regarding virologic response, we found no strong consistent associations with the polymorphisms assayed. Among blacks the cumulative incidence of virologic failure was lowest with 516/983 slow metabolizer genotypes. While biologically plausible, extensive metabolizers should still have sufficient efavirenz concentrations to control HIV-1 replication. We hypothesize that among slow efavirenz metabolizers, sustained high efavirenz concentrations during brief periods of non-adherence may allow continued control of HIV-1 replication. In exploratory analyses, however, we saw no interaction between *CYP2B6* genotype and self-reported non-adherence. Although intriguing, this association of 516/983 slow metabolizer genotype and virologic failure was not seen in whites or Hispanics, and thus requires replication in other cohorts.

Regarding CNS events, among whites the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or higher events was highest among individuals with 516/983 slow metabolizer genotypes. This association is again plausible. It was therefore unexpected that this association was not seen among blacks, in whom slow metabolizer genotypes are more frequent. Furthermore, none of the 16 subjects with slow metabolizer genotypes in the Hispanic subgroup reported adverse CNS events. The original report that associated *CYP2B6* 516G→T with CNS adverse experiences (and which included 154 individuals from the present study) was too small for subgroup analyses [[3](#R3)], and captured efavirenz side effects with more sensitive targeted questionnaires.

A small open-label study suggested that, among individuals receiving efavirenz-based regimens, dose reduction among individuals with slow metabolizer genotypes may reduce self-reported CNS symptoms [[15](#R15)]. Our study, however, suggests that slow metabolizer genotypes may confer some virologic benefit, and raises concern that dose reduction may increase risk of virologic failure.
