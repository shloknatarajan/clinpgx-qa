## Abstract

**Aim:** 
Oxycodone is partly metabolized to the active metabolite oxymorphone by hepatic CYP2D6 in the liver. Significant genetic variability in CYP2D6 activity affects oxymorphone formation. This study aimed to associate CYP2D6 genotype and oxycodone's metabolism.

**Methods:** 
30 children were administered oral oxycodone postoperatively. Plasma levels of oxycodone and oxymorphone, and CYP2D6 genotype were analyzed. CYP2D6 genotype and oxycodone metabolism phenotype were determined based on CYP2D6 total activity score (TAS) and metabolism phenotype: poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), extensive metabolizer (EM) or ultrarapid metabolizer (UM).

**Results:** 
Compared with PM/IM subjects, significantly greater oxymorphone exposure was seen in EM subjects (p = 0.02 for Cmax, p = 0.016 for AUC0–6 and p = 0.026 for AUC0–24). Similarly, higher TAS value was found to be associated with greater oxymorphone exposure. Higher conversion of oxycodone to oxymorphone was observed in EM subjects compared with PM/IM subjects (p = 0.0007 for Cmax, p = 0.001 for AUC0–6 and p = 0.004 for AUC0–24).

**Conclusion:** 
CYP2D6 phenotypes explain metabolism of oxycodone in children, and oxymorphone exposure is higher in CYP2D6 EM phenotype. Further studies are needed to predict the occurrence of adverse event and tailor oxycodone dose for a specific CYP2D6 phenotype.

### Aim:

Oxycodone is partly metabolized to the active metabolite oxymorphone by hepatic CYP2D6 in the liver. Significant genetic variability in CYP2D6 activity affects oxymorphone formation. This study aimed to associate *CYP2D6* genotype and oxycodone's metabolism.

### Methods:

30 children were administered oral oxycodone postoperatively. Plasma levels of oxycodone and oxymorphone, and *CYP2D6* genotype were analyzed. *CYP2D6* genotype and oxycodone metabolism phenotype were determined based on CYP2D6 total activity score (TAS) and metabolism phenotype: poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), extensive metabolizer (EM) or ultrarapid metabolizer (UM).

### Results:

Compared with PM/IM subjects, significantly greater oxymorphone exposure was seen in EM subjects (p = 0.02 for C_max_, p = 0.016 for AUC_0–6_ and p = 0.026 for AUC_0–24_). Similarly, higher TAS value was found to be associated with greater oxymorphone exposure. Higher conversion of oxycodone to oxymorphone was observed in EM subjects compared with PM/IM subjects (p = 0.0007 for C_max_, p = 0.001 for AUC_0–6_ and p = 0.004 for AUC_0–24_).

### Conclusion:

*CYP2D6* phenotypes explain metabolism of oxycodone in children, and oxymorphone exposure is higher in *CYP2D6* EM phenotype. Further studies are needed to predict the occurrence of adverse event and tailor oxycodone dose for a specific *CYP2D6* phenotype.

## Methods

### Study design

We conducted a prospective observational study that is part of an ongoing Phase IV study to characterize the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate the safety of oxycodone administered to children following a surgical procedure. Approval was obtained from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from parents/legal guardians. This study is registered with C[linicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov), identifier #[NCT01959204](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01959204).

### Participants

Children aged 2–17 years undergoing painful orthopedic, thoracic, urology and colorectal procedures were enrolled as part of the larger study. Subjects of American Society of Anesthesiologists status I or II were either enrolled preoperatively or postoperatively with the expectation that they would require IV access after inpatient surgery and postoperative analgesia with an opiate-level medication. Children were excluded if they were known to have used an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 within 14 days of dosing with oxycodone [[21](#B21)]. Children were excluded if they had a history of smoking, alcohol consumption or drug addiction.

Patients were given oxycodone oral solution (0.1 mg/kg for children aged 2–6 years, 0.08 mg/kg for ages 7–12 years and 0.07 mg/kg for ages 13–17 years) after being postoperatively cleared to transition to oral pain medication. Safety was assessed for 24 h following oxycodone dose by monitoring and recording adverse events, vital sign measurements and physical examination findings.

### Pharmacokinetic sampling

Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected for the determination of plasma concentrations of oxycodone at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h following oxycodone administration. Oxycodone and oxymorphone levels in plasma were analyzed by LC–MS/MS (Biologistic Services, CO, USA). The assay's lower limit of quantitation for oxycodone and oxymorphone was 0.02 ng/ml.

### Pharmacokinetic analysis

Oxycodone and oxymorphone pharmacokinetics after a single dose of oxycodone oral solution were characterized using noncompartmental analysis using Phoenix Win-Nonlin^®^ (version 6.1, Pharsight, CA, USA). The peak concentration (C_max_), time to peak concentration (T_max_), terminal half-life (T_1/2_) and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for oxycodone and oxymorphone using the plasma concentration–time profiles. Actual postdose sample collection times were utilized to generate individual concentration–time profiles using noncompartmental analysis. Terminal half-lives were typically calculated using the terminal 2–3 time points after carefully examining the individual concentration time profile. The area under the plasma concentration time curve was calculated by the linear up/log down method. In addition to the observed AUC_0–last_, partial areas under the concentration–time curves were evaluated to calculate the exposure up to 6 h (AUC_0–6_), 12 h (AUC_0–12_) and 24 h (AUC_0–24_). All pharmacokinetic parameters were normalized by the actual oxycodone dose for standardization.

### Genotyping

Blood was drawn in the operating room upon placement of intravenous line prior to surgery. DNA was isolated on the same day and frozen at -20°C. Batched genotyping for a panel of *CYP2D6* alleles was performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments approved and Certification Authorization Professional-certified laboratory after clinical data were entered on study participants. *CYP2D6* alleles, as defined in the internationally recognized human CYP450 database [[22](#B22)] included functional alleles **2, *2A* and **35*, reduced function alleles **9, *10, *17* and **41*, and nonfunctional alleles **3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *11, *14, *15, *18, *19, *20, *40, *42* and **44*. When these variants were not identified, **1* was assumed. The TaqMan allelic discrimination system (Applied Biosystem, CA, USA) was used to analyze all alleles except *CYP2D6*5* allele (full gene deletion) and *CYP2D6* duplication, which were detected by long-PCR [[23](#B23)].

Predicted oxycodone metabolism phenotypes were designated by two methods: a total activity score (TAS) [[24](#B24)] and the descriptive metabolism phenotype ([Table 2](#T2)). The summed TAS of 1.0 represents both full function + null function alleles and reduced function + reduced function alleles which may represent two distinctive pharmacokinetic groups. Evidence exists not only for reduced expression [[22](#B22),[25](#B25)] but also for substrate specificity of reduced function *CYP2D6* alleles [[26](#B26)]. Our second method using descriptive metabolism phenotype distinguishes between predicted phenotypes that contain at least one full function allele and those that do not.

### Pharmacogenetic analysis

The pharmacokinetic parameters such as dose-normalized C_max_, AUC_0–6_, AUC_0–24_ were plotted with respect to *CYP2D6* genotype groups PM/IM or EM. To establish relationship among dose-normalized C_max_, AUC_0–6_, and AUC_0–24_ of oxycodone and oxymorphone with TAS, these parameters were plotted with respect to TAS of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2. Extent of conversion of oxycodone to oxymorphone with respect to *CYP2D6* genotype group PM/IM or EM was investigated by plotting oxymorphone/oxycodone ratio of C_max_, AUC_0–6_, AUC_0–24_ with respect to *CYP2D6* genotype. Similarly, oxymorphone/oxycodone ratio of C_max_, AUC_0–6_, AUC_0–24_ was compared with distinct pharmacokinetic groups formed by TAS.

### Statistical analysis

Numerical data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The statistical difference of pharmacokinetic parameter in two groups was calculated by performing nonparametric unpaired Mann–Whitney test using GraphPad software^®^ (GraphPad Prism, CA, USA). The p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Distribution of genotypes & phenotypes

[Table 2](#T2) details the list of the observed *CYP2D6* genotype, *CYP2D6* phenotype and the corresponding counts. Of all the enrolled children, only one was classified as PM with **4/*41* genotype. Thirteen children were classified as intermediate metabolizer (IM) with five children with **1/*4* genotype and four children with **2A/*4* genotype. The remaining 16 children were classified as extensive metabolizers (EMs), with **1/*1* (n = 5) and **1/*2A* (n = 6) being the most frequent genotypes.

### Oxycodone & metabolite pharmacokinetics and modeling

The concentration–time profiles for oxycodone appeared to have a single phase post-C_max_ ([Figure 2](#F0002)A). Oral absorption of oxycodone typically resulted in 1–2 concentration peaks with a median peak time of about 2 h with no noticeable difference across the three age groups. While fast absorption was observed in most of the subjects, delayed absorption was observed in a few subjects with peak concentrations occurring about 12 h postdosing. Overall, concentration–time profiles of oxymorphone were parallel to the observed oxycodone concentration with oxymorphone concentrations between 1 and 5% of the observed oxycodone concentration. None of the 24 h samples had observable oxymorphone concentrations ([Figure 2](#F0002)B). Times to peak concentration for oxymorphone were very similar to that of oxycodone. The mean terminal half-life for oxycodone was 2.7 (±0.7) h and that for oxymorphone was 3.6 (±1.9) h. Dose-normalized C_max_ of 2.2 (±1.5) arbitrary unit (AU) was observed for oxycodone while it was estimated to be 0.054 (±0.056) AU for oxymorphone. The dose-normalized AUC_0–24_ was estimated to be 10.9 (±4.5) AU for oxycodone and 0.22 (±0.14) AU for oxymorphone.

Oxycodone was administered orally to children postoperatively; dosing was based on age (0.1 mg/kg for children ages 2–6 years, 0.08 mg/kg for ages 7–12 years, and 0.07 mg/kg for ages 13 –17 years). The blood samples were collected till 24 hours.

### Genetic association: impact of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism

The impact of *CYP2D6* genetic polymorphism on the oxycodone pharmacokinetics was evaluated by observing the variation of exposure markers (C_max_, AUC_0–6_ and AUC_0–24_) with respect to the *CYP2D6* genotype and CYP2D6 TAS. There was no significant difference in exposure markers of oxycodone metabolism among PM/IM and EM of *CYP2D6* ([Figure 3](#F0003)A for dose-normalized C_max_, [Figure 4](#F0004)A for dose-normalized AUC_0–6_ and [Figure 5](#F0005)A for dose-normalized AUC_0–24_). A similar comparison of oxymorphone exposure among PM/IM and EM showed significantly higher exposure in EM. The p-value of 0.028 was observed for dose-normalized C_max_ levels ([Figure 3](#F0003)A) in PM/IM and EM. Higher dose-normalized AUC_0–6_ (p = 0.0162; [Figure 4](#F0004)A) and dose-normalized AUC_0–24_ (p = 0.026; [Figure 5](#F0005)A) for oxymorphone were seen in EM. As shown in [Figure 5](#F0005)B, TAS had clear impact on dose-normalized oxymorphone AUC_0–24_ (p = 0.0091 among TAS 1 and 2 groups), though a similar impact on dose-normalized oxycodone AUC_0–24_ was not observed. This is consistent with the current understanding that oxymorphone formation accounts for about 1–5% of oxycodone elimination. Dose-normalized oxymorphone AUC_0–24_ estimates tended to be unreliable because extrapolation after the last dose accounted for >20% of the sample. Similar results were obtained when the impact of TAS on dose-normalized AUC_0–6_ ([Figure 4](#F0004)B) and C_max_ ([Figure 3](#F0003)B) of oxymorphone was evaluated. IMs consistently had lower oxymorphone exposures than EMs as determined by the Mann–Whitney test.

(A) Dose normalized maximum plasma concentration values of oxycodone in oxymorphone were compared in CYP2D6 phenotype groups PM/IM (n = 14) and EM (n = 16). The results are expressed as mean ± 95% CI. No statistical difference was observed in two groups in oxycodone Cmax values. The two groups were statistically significant in oxymorphone Cmax as determined by unpaired Mann–Whitney test. (B) Oxycodone and oxymorphone Cmax values were plotted with respect to CYP2D6 total activity score (TAS). A trend line was drawn connecting mean Cmax of groups with TAS values 1 and 2. The trend line showed higher slope for oxymorphone with high TAS associated with bigger Cmax. EM: Extensive metabolizer; IM: Intermediate metabolizer; PM: Poor metabolizer.

(A) Dose normalized integrated exposure of oxycodone and oxymorphone were compared in CYP2D6 phenotype groups PM/IM (n = 14) and EM (n = 16). The results are expressed as mean ± 95% CI. No statistical difference was observed in two groups in oxycodone AUC0–6. A statistically significant difference in oxymorphone AUC0–6 was observed by unpaired Mann–Whitney test. (B) Oxycodone and oxymorphone AUC0–6 were plotted with respect to CYP2D6 total activity score (TAS). A trend line was drawn connecting mean AUC­0–6 of groups with TAS values 1 and 2. The trend line showed higher slope for oxymorphone with high TAS value associated with higher AUC­0–6. AUC: Area under the curve; EM: Extensive metabolizer; IM: Intermediate metabolizer; PM: Poor metabolizer.

(A) Dose normalized integrated exposure of oxycodone and oxymorphone were compared in CYP2D6 phenotype groups PM/IM (n = 14) and EM (n = 16). The results are expressed as mean ± 95% CI. No statistical difference was observed in two groups in oxycodone AUC0–24. A statistically significant difference in oxymorphone AUC0–24 was observed by unpaired Mann–Whitney test. (B) Oxycodone and oxymorphone AUC0–24 were plotted with respect to CYP2D6 total activity score (TAS). A trend line was drawn connecting mean AUC­0–24 of groups with TAS values 1 and 2. The trend line showed higher slope for oxymorphone with high TAS value associated with higher AUC­0–24. AUC: Area under the curve; EM: Extensive metabolizer; IM: Intermediate metabolizer; PM: Poor metabolizer.

The impact of CYP2D6 activity was further evaluated using the ratio of oxymorphone-to-oxycodone exposures to normalize the impact of intersubject variation in exposure due to variable bioavailability. Significantly higher oxymorphone/oxycodone ratio was observed for EM for C_max_ (p = 0.0007; [Figure 6](#F0006)A), AUC_0–6_ (p = 0.001; [Figure 7](#F0007)A) and AUC_0–24_ (p = 0.004; [Figure 8](#F0008)A). As observed previously, the oxymorphone exposure relative to oxycodone exposure was consistently dependent on the *CYP2D6* phenotype with higher activity phenotypes having higher oxymorphone exposures ([Figures 6](#F0006)B, [7](#F0007)B & [8](#F0008)B).

## Discussion

Our study offers early evidence that *CYP2D6* phenotype significantly affects oxycodone metabolism in pediatric surgical patients. Patients with more active CYP2D6 activity and oxycodone metabolism had higher levels of oxymorphone in comparison to phenotypes with less CYP2D6 activity.

In an age where personalized medicine is gaining more popularity, there is increasing focus to better understand the pharmacogenetic influence on the response and side effects of opioid medications [[27–30](#B27)]. To this end, the main purpose of this study was to identify the role of pharmacogenetic variability on the pharmacokinetics of oral oxycodone in children undergoing surgery. We have demonstrated that phenotypic activity of *CYP2D6* significantly influenced oxymorphone levels in children taking oxycodone. By normalizing the impact of intersubject variation in exposure due to variable bioavailability of oxycodone, we again showed that oxymorphone exposure was higher with increased phenotypic activity of *CYP2D6*. Overall, these results suggest that there is variability in oxycodone metabolism as determined by the child's underlying *CYP2D6* genotype. More attention should be paid while administering oxycodone to EM and PM due to possibility of toxic effects or lack of efficacy [[31](#B31)].

Certain populations have higher prevalence of *CYP2D6* UM phenotype (20% in Saudi Arabians [[32](#B32)] and 29% in Ethiopians [[33](#B33)]) compared with 1–7% prevalence in Caucasians [[19](#B19)]. These individuals are likely at higher risk of toxicity from opioids metabolized by CYP2D6 pathway including oxycodone, codeine, tramadol and hydrocodone, and more vigilance is required when these opioids are administered in these population and *CYP2D6* UMs.

This study included children of different age ranging from 2 to 16 year. Initially, we recruited older children (>6 years). We are trying to recruit younger children (2–6 years) in a larger study. The fractional CYP2D6 expression at birth is 3.6% of adult value and 50% adult level expression is reached at 1.2 months [[34](#B34)]. Thus, our findings correlating *CYP2D6* phenotype with oxycodone dosing could be extrapolated for young children and even neonates. However, we need to validate our findings from older children in younger children.

In a cross-sectional study in adult cancer patients taking oxycodone, it was observed that while different *CYP2D6* genotypes resulted in varying pharmacokinetics of oxycodone, they did not produce any observable difference in markers of efficacy such as pain score, symptoms of nausea, sedation and cognitive failure [[35](#B35)]. This adult study had many confounders and limitations in terms of robust clinical phenotypes. In another study, in healthy adult volunteers by Zwisler *et al*., significant difference was observed in pain reduction, pain tolerance, discomfort and oxymorphone/oxycodone ratio between *CYP2D6* EM and PM individuals [[36](#B36)]. This study further corroborates our oxycodone PK and *CYP2D6* association findings in children. This study is clinically important as children tend to experience more adverse effects including deaths and life-threatening respiratory depression from clinical use of opioids compared with adults [[4](#B4)]. In this study, we focused on clinical doses of oxycodone and *CYP2D6* genotype on oxycodone's metabolism in children for the first time.

Recent Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines [[37](#B37)], cautions against the use of codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone and oxycodone in *CYP2D6* PMs for analgesic efficacy reasons and in UM for toxicity reasons. Further studies are needed to verify if difference in oxycodone pharmacokinetics in children results in varying postoperative response.

One limitation to our pilot study is the small number of extreme *CYP2D6* phenotypes studied, which lead to fewer numbers of phenotypes in our study population. Only one child was classified as a PM and no children were identified as UMs. More patients are required to better understand the effect of low and ultra-rapid activity *CYP2D6* phenotypes on oxycodone pharmacokinetics. It is an ongoing study and we will have a bigger sample with more PMs and UMs at the end of the study to associate not only with oxycodone's pharmacokinetics but also with clinical outcomes. Another limitation is that we were not able to perform a direct prospective comparison of clinical effects of oxycodone with codeine. In our institution, we have stopped the use of codeine in children following tonsillectomy and other surgery after the FDA's black box warning on codeine's use in the same because of its unpredictability and number of postoperative deaths and anoxic brain injuries.

More studies are warranted to investigate whether the incidence of adverse events in children taking oxycodone is influenced by the genetic impact on oxycodone metabolism. This will help in determining the safety profile of this opioid medication in children following painful surgery. Additionally, it may allow us to better tailor pain management strategies for individual children by optimizing pain relief while avoiding adverse reactions.

## Conclusion & future perspective

In conclusion, our pediatric pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic association pilot study shows that *CYP2D6* genotypes play a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and its metabolite, oxymorphone. Specifically, children identified as being EMs of oxycodone had greater exposure to oxymorphone, an active and potent metabolite of oxycodone compared with PMs.

Pharmacokinetic variations due to multiple phenotypes of *CYP2D6* need to be considered when personalizing oxycodone use in a specific child. Based on *CYP2D6* phenotype, a patient might need oxycodone dose adjustment or even a different therapeutic alternative not metabolized by CYP2D6 such as oral morphine, hydromorphone and tapentadol. Large studies are warranted to further ascertain whether the influence of pharmacogenetic variability on oxycodone pharmacokinetics is associated with clinically important outcomes in children. Personalized opioid selection and oxycodone dosing based on *CYP2D6* genotype for an individual child may improve pain control following surgery while limiting dangerous adverse side effects.
