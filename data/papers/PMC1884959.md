## Abstract

**Aims:** 
To study the effect of CYP2C8*3, the most common CYP2C8 variant allele on the dis-position of (R)-ibuprofen and the association of CYP2C8*3 with variant CYP2C9 alleles.

**Methods:** 
Three hundred and fifty-five randomly selected Spanish Caucasians were screened for the common CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 mutations. The pharmacokinetics of (R)-ibuprofen were studied in 25 individuals grouped into different CYP2C8 genotypes.

**Results:** 
The allele frequency of CYP2C8*3 (0.17) was found to be higher than that reported for other Caucasian populations (P = 0.0001). The frequencies of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 were 0.19 (0.16–0.21) and 0.10 (0.08–0.12), respectively. An association between CYP2C8*3 and CYP2C9*2 alleles was observed, occurring together at a frequency 2.4-fold higher than expected for a random association of alleles (P = 0.0001). The presence of the CYP2C8*3 allele was found to influence the pharmacokinetics of (R)-ibuprofen in a gene–dose effect manner. Thus, after administration of 400 mg ibuprofen, the plasma half-life (95% confidence intervals) for individuals with genotypes CYP2C8*1/*1, CYP2C8*1/*3 and CYP2C8*3/*3, was 2.0 h (1.8–2.2), 4.2 h (1.9–6.5; P < 0.05) and 9.0 h (7.8–10.2; P < 0.002), respectively. A statistically significant trend with respect to the number of variant CYP2C8*3 alleles was also observed for the area under the concentration-time curve (P < 0.025), and drug clearance (P < 0.03).

**Conclusion:** 
Polymorphism of the CYP2C8 gene was found to be common, with nearly 30% of the population studied carrying the variant CYP2C8*3 allele. The presence of the latter caused a significant effect on the disposition of (R)-ibuprofen. This suggests that a substantial proportion of Caucasian subjects may show alterations in the disposition of drugs that are CYP2C8 substrates.

## Introduction

Interindividual variability in drug metabolism is a major cause of adverse drug effects. In many cases such variability is linked to polymorphisms in genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes. Among the enzyme families that compose the cytochrome P-450 multi-enzyme (CYP) system, the most relevant for drug metabolism are the CYP2 and CYP3 families. CYP2C enzymes account for about 20% of the total CYP in liver microsomes [[1](#b1), [2](#b2)] and are involved in the metabolism of about 20% of clinically used drugs [[3](#b3)]. All members of the *CYP2C* gene subfamily, namely *CYP2C8*, *CYP2C9*, *CYP2C18* and *CYP2C19*, are polymorphic. An updated list of allelic variants is available at ([http://www.imm.ki.se/CYPalleles/](http://www.imm.ki.se/CYPalleles/)).

In contrast to other members of the *CYP2C* gene subfamily, little is known regarding *CYP2C8* gene polymorphism, because mutations have only recently been described, and because most of them seem to occur at low frequencies. Four variant alleles causing amino acid changes have been reported, and are designated as *CYP2C8***2* to **5*, with the wild-type being *CYP2C8***1*[[4](#b4)–[6](#b6)]. Two of these variant alleles, *CYP2C8***3* and *CYP2C8***4,* occur at frequencies of greater than 5% among Caucasians [[5](#b5)]. The *CYP2C8***3* allelic variant encodes an enzyme containing two amino acid changes, namely R139K and K399R [[4](#b4)]. *CYP2C8***2* and *CYP2C8*5* have been detected in black and oriental individuals, respectively [[4](#b4), [6](#b6)], but do not occur among Caucasians. *CYP2C8***4* does not seem to cause a significant effect on enzyme activity [[5](#b5)].

Heterologously expressed, *CYP2C8***3* causes impaired paclitaxel metabolism [[4](#b4)], however no studies have been conducted *in vivo* to test the hypothesis that inheritance of *CYP2C8*3* influences metabolism. Two factors have hampered the study of the effect of variant *CYP2C8* alleles *in vivo*. One is the relatively low frequency of these variant alleles, which for *CYP2C8***3* ranges from 0.095–0.155 in Caucasians [[4](#b4), [5](#b5), [7](#b7), [8](#b8)] ([Table 1](#tbl1)). This makes it difficult to identify subjects that are homozygous for *CYP2C8***3*, unless a large population sample is analysed. The second problem has been the identification of a suitable substrate of CYP2C8. Many are either nonspecific or too toxic to be used as probe drugs *in vivo*. CYP2C8 plays a significant role in the metabolism of the anticancer drug paclitaxel [[5](#b5), [9](#b9), [10](#b10)], the antimalarial drug amodiaquine [[11](#b11)], the hypoglycaemic agent troglitazone [[12](#b12)], as well as amiodarone [[13](#b13)], verapamil [[14](#b14)] and ibuprofen [[15](#b15)]. In addition, CYP2C8 plays a secondary role in the metabolism of fluvastatin [[16](#b16)], amitriptyline [[17](#b17)], perphenazine [[18](#b18)], diclofenac [[19](#b19)], gallopamil [[20](#b20)], omeprazole [[21](#b21)] and carbamazepine [[22](#b22)]. Out of these substrates we selected ibuprofen because it is widely used and relatively well tolerated [[23](#b23)]. The main phase I enzymes involved in ibuprofen metabolism are CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. Ibuprofen metabolism is stereoselective, and it has been shown that CYP2C8 plays a key role in the hydroxylation of the (R)-enantiomer [[15](#b15), [24](#b24)]. It may be possible, therefore, to use the disposition of (R)-ibuprofen as an index of CYP2C8 activity *in vivo*.

Table 1 Caption: CYP2C8*3 allele frequencies in different Caucasian populations

In this study we have analysed the *CYP2C8* genotype in a large population to determine the frequency of *CYP2C8*^*^*3*, and to identify individuals with nonmutated, heterozygous and homozygous mutated *CYP2C8* genotypes. The effect of the different genotypes on (R)-ibuprofen pharmacokinetics was then investigated.

## Methods

The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Infanta Cristina, Badajoz, Spain. Written consent was obtained from participants, all of whom were Spanish nationals. Because in a previous study we detected significant differences in the frequency of *CYP2C9* variant alleles between Spanish and other Caucasians [[25](#b25)], for the present study we selected a new group of 355 healthy subjects, of whom 182 were women with mean age ± SD of 45.4 ± 14.8 years, and 173 were men with mean age of 43.5 ± 14.3 years. The subjects underwent a medical examination to confirm good health. Over 95% of the subjects agreed to provide DNA samples for genotyping analyses. Blood samples were frozen immediately after collection and kept at −80 °C until analysed. Genomic DNA was prepared from leucocytes and dissolved in sterile 10 m m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at a final concentration of 400–600 µg ml^−1^. The samples were stored at 4 °C in sterile plastic vials.

Genotyping analyses were carried out to detect *CYP2C8***3*, *CYP2C9***2* and *CYP2C9***3*. According standard procedures, CYP2C8*1 and CYP2C9*1 variant alleles were assigned as those lacking the mutations analysed in the corresponding genes. In this regard it should be stated that other variant alleles are rare among Caucasian individuals, and therefore the risk for a misclassification of other variant alleles as CYP2C8*1 or CYP2C9*1 is negligible. Screening for *CYP2C8***3* was carried out by amplification-restriction as described previously [[4](#b4)]. Briefly, primers 5′-CTTCCGTGCTAC ATGATGACG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTGAGAA AGGCATG AAG-3′ were used in a mismatch PCR-RFLP test. The 117 bp PCR product was purified and digested with the endonuclease *Xmn*I. This produced two fragments of 92 and 25 bp in the *CYP2C8***1* PCR product, but did not digest the *CYP2C8***3* PCR product. Screening for the *CYP2C9* variants was performed as described elsewhere [[26](#b26)].

### (R)-ibuprofen pharmacokinetics

Subjects received 400 mg racemic ibuprofen (Dalsy®, Abbot Laboratories, S.A., Madrid, Spain) between 8.00 am and 10.00 am after an overnight fast. Plasma samples were collected from 0 to 12 h after administration, and immediately frozen until analysis. The determination of (R)-ibuprofen was carried by HPLC with ultraviolet detection at 220 nm by using a LiChroCart 250–4 Whelk01(S,S) column [[27](#b27)]. Plasma samples 0.5 ml were acidified with 0.2 ml 0.1 m HCl and vortexed. They were then extracted for 15 min with 3 ml *n*-hexane/diethyl ether (95/5 v/v) and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × **g**. Two millilitres of the supernatant was evaporated under a nitrogen stream and the residue was resuspended in 250 µl mobile phase composed of *n*-hexane/*t-*butyl methyl ether/acetic acid 70/30/0.1 (v/v). The limit of determination was 0.2 mg litre^−1^. The interday and intraday coefficients of variation were less than 11% and less than 10%, respectively. Pharmacokinetic analyses were carried out using WinNonlin 1.1 software (Scientific Consulting Inc., Apex, North Carolina, USA).

### Statistical analysis

The intergroup comparison values were performed using the statistical package SPSS 11.0.1. (SPSS Inc., Chigaco, Ill, USA). The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters between individuals with different genotypes. The confidence intervals for the differences between means were calculated using the *t*-test for unpaired observations. The chi-squared (χ^2^) test was used for comparison of genotype frequencies and association of *CYP2C8* and *CYP2C9* variant alleles, unless the conditions for the application of this test were not adequate. In such cases, Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the *P*-value.

## Results

The allele frequency (95% CI) of *CYP2C8***3* in the population studied (*n* = 355 individuals) was 0.17 (0.14–0.20), which is significantly higher than that of the pooled frequencies reported for other Caucasian subjects ([Table 1](#tbl1)) (*n* = 1770, frequency (95% CI) 0.10 (0.09–0.11), 95% CI on the differences 0.040–0.099, chi-squared = 25.0, *P* = 0.001). Frequencies (95% CI) of 0.19 (0.16–0.21) and 0.10 (0.08–0.12) were observed for the *CYP2C9***2* and *CYP2C9***3* alleles, respectively, which were higher than those observed in a large study of Swedish subjects, 0.11 (0.10–0.12) and 0.07 (0.06–0.07) respectively. The differences (95% CI, *P*-value) between allele frequencies were 0.080 (0.049–0.111, *P* = 0.0001) for *CYP2C9***2* and 0.031 (0.007–0.055, *P* = 0.001) for *CYP2C9***3*[[8](#b8)]. No unexpected bands were detected after PCR amplification of either *CYP2C8* or *CYP2C9* gene fragments. All variants alleles were at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the population studied.

Most individuals that possessed the *CYP2C8***3* allele were also carriers of *CYP2C9***2* ([Table 2](#tbl2)). The proportion of individuals carrying combinations of both alleles (0.259) is higher than expected from the allele frequencies. The difference (95% CI, *P*-value) between the actual and the expected proportion of carriers of *CYP2C8***3* and *CYP2C9***2* combination was 0.149 (0.093–0.205, *P* = 0.0001). No association between *CYP2C8***3* and the other *CYP2C9* alleles was observed.

[Figure 1](#fig01) shows the plasma concentration–time courses for (R)-ibuprofen in individuals with the different *CYP2C8* genotypes. There were nine subjects homozygous for *CYP2C8***1*, 10 with the genotype *CYP2C8***1/CYP2C8***3*, and six who were homozygous for *CYP2C8***3*. None of these subjects had the *CYP2C9***3* allele. To determine the effect of *CYP2C9***2* allele alone, three individuals with genotype *CYP2C8***3* but who lacked *CYP2C9***2* were included in the heterozygous panel ([Figure 1](#fig01)). No significant differences were observed between carriers and noncarriers of *CYP2C9***2* in any of the parameters studied, and therefore the group composed of heterozygous subjects was analysed as a whole for comparison with other genotypes. [Figure 1](#fig01) shows that the presence of the *CYP2C8***3* allele is a determinant of pharmacokinetics for (R)-ibuprofen. The pharmacokinetic parameters for individuals with no, one and two *CYP2C8***3* alleles are shown in [Table 3](#tbl3). There was a statistically significant gene–dose effect for AUC (*P* = 0.025), *t*_1/2_ (*P* < 0.025) and drug clearance (*P* = 0.030).

## Discussion

Several polymorphisms of CYP have been studied extensively, but little information about variability in the allele frequency, and the effect on enzyme activity of the *CYP2C8* polymorphisms is available. In this study we observed the highest allele frequency for CYP2C8*3 described so far. Such finding is in agreement with growing evidences indicating that, even within caucasian individuals, major differences in CYP allele frequencies exist [[28](#b28)–[32](#b32)].

The frequency of *CYP2C8*3* alleles in the present Spanish population is similar to that reported for British subjects, but greater than that observed in Swedish individuals ([Table 1](#tbl1)). Our data indicate that over 30% of the population analysed carry variant *CYP2C8***3* alleles, making it a common polymorphism among Caucasians. The presence of *CYP2C8***3* alleles generally occurred in combination with *CYP2C9***2* alleles. Indeed, individuals carrying both alleles were at a 2.4-fold higher frequency than expected for a random association of alleles. In subjects homozygous for *CYP2C8***3*, the prevalence of *CYP2C9***2* homozygotes was 20.2-fold higher than expected. This is in agreement with previous reports indicating an association between *CYP2C8***3* and *CYP2C9***2* alleles, although in the present population, both alleles occurred with a frequency of nearly twofold higher than that in a previous report [[8](#b8)].

Both CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 contribute equally to the metabolism of (R)-ibuprofen *in vivo*[[15](#b15)]. In order to minimise an effect of *CYP2C9* genotype on (R)-ibuprofen pharmacokinetics, subjects carrying *CYP2C9***3* alleles were excluded. However, those with *CYP2C9***2* were not excluded, because in most cases *CYP2C8***3* is co-inherited with *CYP2C9***2*. Although a role for the CYP2C9*2 enzyme in decreased R-ibuprofen metabolism cannot be excluded, our findings suggest that the effect on (R)-ibuprofen pharmacokinetics is attributable to the *CYP2C8*3* allele, because there were no significant differences between the carriers of *CYP2C8*3* who did or did not possess the *CYP2C9***2* allele. Because of the high degree of association between *CYP2C8***3* and *CYP2C9***2*, we could include only one subject that carried one *CYP2C9***2* allele in the *CYP2C8*3* homozygote group, which precluded a statistical comparison between carriers and non-carriers of *CYP2C9***2*. Nevertheless, the concentration versus time curve of the former subject is similar to those of subjects double homozygous for *CYP2C8***3* and *CYP2C9*2* alleles. Our findings are in agreement with data indicating that *CYP2C9***2* does not contain mutations that affect substrate binding capacity [[32](#b32)], and with the observation that *CYP2C9* genotype does not influence (R)-ibuprofen pharmacokinetics [[27](#b27)]. Nevertheless, further analyses involving sufficient numbers with different combinations of *CYP2C8* and *CYP2C9* genotypes are required to elucidate fully the contribution of *CYP2C9***2* to decreased ibuprofen metabolism.

In summary our findings indicate that the *CYP2C8* polymorphism is a determinant of the pharmacokinetics of (R)-ibuprofen. This study also suggests that the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates, for example the highly toxic paclitaxel of the CYP2C8 enzyme, may be altered in nearly 20–30% of Caucasian subjects, depending on their ethnic origin. Further studies should focus on the impact of CYP2C8 polymorphism on the disposition and/or side effects caused by these drugs. Genotyping techniques, or phenotyping methods such as that described here, may be useful tools to predict impaired metabolism when using drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and that have reduced therapeutic range.
