## Abstract

**Aims:** 
Lopinavir (LPV) is not a first‐line regimen. According to recent WHO data, LPV usage in low‐ and middle‐income countries accounted for approximately 52% of the adult and 23% of the paediatric protease inhibitor market in 2017. Since LPV is a substrate for the SLCO1B1 (OATP1B1) transporter, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms (rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056) on LPV trough plasma concentrations (C trough) in Serbian patients.

**Methods:** 
Plasma samples from 104 HIV/AIDS Caucasians were collected. LPV C trough was quantified using liquid‐chromatography‐mass spectrometry. Genotyping was carried out using real‐time‐PCR‐based allelic discrimination. One‐way analysis of variance, t test and linear regression were used for data analysis.

**Results:** 
The overall mean (SD) LPV C trough was 5885 ± 2755 ng/mL. Significant differences were between patients with different rs11045819 genotypes: CC (LPV median C trough = 6072 ng/mL, interquartile range (IQR) = 4318–7617 ng/mL), CA (LPV median C trough = 4987 ng/mL, IQR = 4300–6295 ng/mL) and AA (LPV median C trough = 3648 ng/mL, IQR = 1949–4072 ng/mL) (P = .005). Significant differences were also observed according to rs4149032 genotype: CC (LPV median C trough = 6027 ng/mL, IQR =4548–8250 ng/mL), CT (LPV median C trough = 5553 ng/mL, IQR = 4300–6888 ng/mL) and TT (LPV median C trough = 4408 ng/mL, IQR = 3361–5233 ng/mL) (P = .007). For rs4149056 a statistically significant difference between T‐homozygotes (LPV median C trough = 5434 ng/mL, IQR = 3855–6830 ng/mL), heterozygotes (LPV median C trough = 6707 ng/mL, IQR = 5088–8063 ng/mL) and C‐homozygotes (LPV median Ctrough = 13906 ng/mL, IQR = 12946–14866 ng/mL) was observed (P = .002). In multivariate regression analysis, only the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 polymorphism was independently associated with higher LPV C trough (β = 2834.5 [1442–4226.9] ng/mL [P = .001]).

**Conclusions:** 
Our results demonstrate a statistically significant influence of the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 polymorphism on higher LPV C trough in Caucasian HIV/AIDS patients.

### Aims

Lopinavir (LPV) is not a first‐line regimen. According to recent WHO data, LPV usage in low‐ and middle‐income countries accounted for approximately 52% of the adult and 23% of the paediatric protease inhibitor market in 2017. Since LPV is a substrate for the SLCO1B1 (OATP1B1) transporter, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms (rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056) on LPV trough plasma concentrations (*C* _trough_) in Serbian patients.

### Methods

Plasma samples from 104 HIV/AIDS Caucasians were collected. LPV *C* _trough_ was quantified using liquid‐chromatography‐mass spectrometry. Genotyping was carried out using real‐time‐PCR‐based allelic discrimination. One‐way analysis of variance, *t* test and linear regression were used for data analysis.

### Results

The overall mean (SD) LPV *C* _trough_ was 5885 ± 2755 ng/mL. Significant differences were between patients with different rs11045819 genotypes: CC (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 6072 ng/mL, interquartile range (IQR) = 4318–7617 ng/mL), CA (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 4987 ng/mL, IQR = 4300–6295 ng/mL) and AA (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 3648 ng/mL, IQR = 1949–4072 ng/mL) (*P* = .005). Significant differences were also observed according to rs4149032 genotype: CC (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 6027 ng/mL, IQR =4548–8250 ng/mL), CT (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 5553 ng/mL, IQR = 4300–6888 ng/mL) and TT (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 4408 ng/mL, IQR = 3361–5233 ng/mL) (*P* = .007). For rs4149056 a statistically significant difference between T‐homozygotes (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 5434 ng/mL, IQR = 3855–6830 ng/mL), heterozygotes (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 6707 ng/mL, IQR = 5088–8063 ng/mL) and C‐homozygotes (LPV median C_trough_ = 13906 ng/mL, IQR = 12946–14866 ng/mL) was observed (*P* = .002). In multivariate regression analysis, only the *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 polymorphism was independently associated with higher LPV *C* _trough_ (β = 2834.5 [1442–4226.9] ng/mL [*P* = .001]).

### Conclusions

Our results demonstrate a statistically significant influence of the *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 polymorphism on higher LPV *C* _trough_ in Caucasian HIV/AIDS patients.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The availability of effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) for the treatment of HIV‐infected patients has stopped progression to AIDS and reduced mortality.[1](#bcp14230-bib-0001), [2](#bcp14230-bib-0002) However, significant interindividual variability in plasma concentration of antiretroviral drugs from extremely low to extremely high levels has been demonstrated.[3](#bcp14230-bib-0003), [4](#bcp14230-bib-0004) For instance, suboptimal plasma concentrations of antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz and nevirapine may lead to development of drug resistance,[5](#bcp14230-bib-0005), [6](#bcp14230-bib-0006) while high concentrations of efavirenz and indinavir may induce adverse events, including toxic side effects.[7](#bcp14230-bib-0007), [8](#bcp14230-bib-0008)

Drug transporters such as solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) have fundamental role in drug uptake, facilitating the clearance of many drugs by delivering them to metabolic enzymes.[9](#bcp14230-bib-0009), [10](#bcp14230-bib-0010) Transporters belonging to the solute carrier organic anion (SLCO) transporter family, which are involved in the transport of several endogenous compounds and drugs, such as cholic acid,[11](#bcp14230-bib-0011) glycocholic acid,[12](#bcp14230-bib-0012) thyroid hormones[13](#bcp14230-bib-0013) and statins,[13](#bcp14230-bib-0013) play an important role in the influx transport of many xenobiotics, particularly in the intestine, hepatocytes, kidneys and placenta.[14](#bcp14230-bib-0014), [15](#bcp14230-bib-0015), [16](#bcp14230-bib-0016), [17](#bcp14230-bib-0017), [18](#bcp14230-bib-0018), [19](#bcp14230-bib-0019), [20](#bcp14230-bib-0020) Genetic polymorphisms in the *SLCO1B1* gene influence the pharmacokinetics of some antiretroviral drugs, including lopinavir (LPV).[20](#bcp14230-bib-0020), [21](#bcp14230-bib-0021), [22](#bcp14230-bib-0022), [23](#bcp14230-bib-0023) Trough concentration (*C* _trough_) is usually used for therapeutic drug monitoring studies linking the concentration of the antiretroviral drug to antiviral effect.[24](#bcp14230-bib-0024), [25](#bcp14230-bib-0025), [26](#bcp14230-bib-0026) It has also been reported that low LPV *C* _trough_ are associated with impairment of virological response in HIV‐infected patients.[27](#bcp14230-bib-0027) Furthermore it is recognized that high LPV *C* _trough_ are associated with adverse effect in HIV‐infected patients.[28](#bcp14230-bib-0028) The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend ritonavir‐boosted LPV (LPV/r) in combination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) as the preferred first‐line regimen in children less than 3 years old, and as the preferred second‐line regimen in adults in resource‐limited settings.[29](#bcp14230-bib-0029) It is also listed as an alternative regimen when the preferred options are precluded,[30](#bcp14230-bib-0030) thus LPV/r is still prescribed in 135 low and ‐middle income countries worldwide.[31](#bcp14230-bib-0031) According to recent WHO data, LPV usage in middle‐ and low‐income countries was about 52% market share of protease inhibitor (PI) in the adult population and about 23% market share in the paediatric population in 2016.[32](#bcp14230-bib-0032) Furthermore, it is projected that in 2016 about 597 000 patients used an LPV regimen in middle‐ and low‐income countries worldwide and it is thought that number has increased to 935 000 in 2018.[32](#bcp14230-bib-0032)

Knowing the potential influence of polymorphisms in *SLCO* genes on LPV *C* _trough_ and the lack of data in the Serbian population, we aimed to quantify the influence of three *SLCO1B1* single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056) on *C* _trough_ of LPV in HIV/AIDS patients.

## 2. METHODS

### 2.1. Patients

In this study, clinically stable HIV‐infected adults, all Caucasians, being treated with LPV (400 mg BID) tablets together with two NRTI at the HIV/AIDS Centre of the University Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Belgrade, Serbia were included. The main inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, confirmed HIV diagnosis and stable on LPV/r‐containing cART regimen for at least 12 weeks. Patients with any hepatitis virus infection, liver cirrhosis and/or fibrosis, pregnancy or breastfeeding, intravenous drug use, recreational drug use, chronic alcohol consumption and concomitant treatment with any drug with known or suspected interaction with LPV/r[33](#bcp14230-bib-0033) were excluded. Patients with history of poor adherence were also excluded. Plasma samples were collected only in those patients who self‐reported that they had not missed a dose in the last 12 weeks, as well as in those who did not take any food together with proscribed cART containing LPV (1 hour before and 2 hours after food intake).

Complete medical history with standard biochemical analysis and liver function tests was taken from the patients' records. The following information was collected for each patient: demographic data (age, gender), medical history and physical findings, routes of HIV infection acquisition, duration of cART (months) and current cART. Body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption were also recorded. To assess adherence to cART, patients were interviewed regarding missing doses (the self‐report method).[34](#bcp14230-bib-0034)

The immunological and virological responses to cART were collected and evaluated on the same day as plasma samples were collected for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analysis by measuring CD4+ T‐cell counts and HIV RNA plasma viral loads (pVL). The CD4+ T‐cells were quantified by flow cytometry, while HIV RNA pVLs were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR; Ultrasensitive assay version 1.5 Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA) with a lower limit of detection of 50 copies/mL (1.7 log_10_).

This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines proposed in the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Written consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine, University of Belgrade.

### 2.2. LPV C trough and SLCO genotyping

Plasma samples were collected 10–14 hours after the last drug intake. Plasma was separated and heat inactivated (at 58°C for 40 min) and frozen at –80°C at the Department of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade until shipping. Samples were transported on dry ice to the Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, UK. Trough LPV plasma concentrations (*C* _trough_) were determined using a previously described liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method.[19](#bcp14230-bib-0019) The lower limit of quantification of LPV was taken as the lowest calibration standard (95 ng/mL). Intra‐assay and inter‐assay coefficients of variation at the limit of quantification were between 5% and 7%, respectively.

Using BD Vacutainer® blood collection devices, full blood samples were collected and pharmacogenetic analysis for *SLCO1B1* rs11045819, *SLCO1B1* rs4149032 and *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 polymorphism analysis was also performed at the Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, UK. Total genomic DNA was isolated using a GenElute Blood Genomic DNA kit (Sigma‐Aldrich, Poole, UK), according to manufacturer's instructions. Genotyping was carried out on 2 μL of the final eluent (100 μL) using a real‐time qPCR‐based allelic discrimination assay as described previously.[19](#bcp14230-bib-0019) All genotyping experiments were performed in duplicate and contained negative controls (no template) and three positive controls for each of the possible genotypes. Genotype was assigned only when both duplicates agreed.

### 2.3. Statistical analysis

Compliance with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated as previously described.[35](#bcp14230-bib-0035) Comparison of genotype frequencies with those reported in other populations was conducted using the chi‐square or Fisher exact test on StatsDirect (version 2.6.8; StatsDirect Ltd, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK). *P* values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Differences in the distribution of continuous variables between patient groups were investigated using independent sample *t* test or one‐way analysis of variance. The general linear model was used to explore associations between LPV *C* _trough_ and patients' age, BMI, time after dose and the selected SNPs. Univariate and multivariate linear regression was used to assess independent predictors of LPV *C* _trough_. All data were analysed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

### 2.5. Results

A total of 104 HIV‐infected patients with mean (standard deviation) age of 44.1 ± 11.6 years and 76.9% males were included in the study. The mean BMI was 23.3 ± 2.12 kg/m^2^. The mean duration of cART was 88.6 ± 12.54 weeks. All patients had undetectable pVL and relatively good immunological status with median CD4+ T‐cell counts of 590.4 cells/mm^3^ (Interquartile range (IQR) = 344.6–836.2 cells/mm^3^).

The allele frequency and genotype distribution of *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms of the study population are shown in Table [1](#bcp14230-tbl-0001). The genotype frequencies of each locus did not deviate from expected Hardy–Weinberg proportions because there were not significant differences between expected and observed frequencies (*P* > .05). The allele frequencies for *SLCO1B1* rs11045819 and *SLCO1B1* rs4149032 polymorphism are similar to frequencies observed in other European populations, including British, Iberian in Spain and Toscani in Italy (*P* > .05) while allele frequencies for *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 polymorphism are similar to frequencies observed in British and Iberian populations in Spain, but there are significantly different allele frequencies for rs4149056 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism between the Toscani population in Italy and allele frequencies for rs4149056 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism in the Serbian population observed in our study (*P* = .03). We also found that allele frequencies for rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism are different from allele frequencies of *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms in the African population (*P* < .05).

### 2.6. Influence of SLC01B1 polymorphisms on LPV C trough

The overall mean (SD) plasma LPV *C* _trough_ was 5885 (±2755) ng/mL. For rs11045819 polymorphism there was a significant trend for decreasing plasma *C* _trough_ of LPV from wild genotype CC (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 6072 ng/mL, IQR = 4318–7617 ng/mL) to CA (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 4987 ng/mL, IQR = 4300–6295 ng/mL) and to AA (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 3648 ng/mL, IQR = 1949–4072 ng/mL). There was a statistically significant difference in LPV C_trough_ between all three genotypes for rs11045819 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism (*P* = .005). When LPV *C* _trough_ values were compared between different genotypes it was observed that LPV *C* _trough_ was statistically lower for AA and AC genotypes in comparison with the CC genotype (*P* = .008 and *P* = .031, respectively).

The distribution of the LPV *C* _trough_ was also statistically associated with rs4149032 polymorphism. A statistically significant trend for decreasing LPV plasma *C* _trough_ from wild genotype CC (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 6027 ng/mL, IQR = 4548–8250 ng/mL) to CT (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 5553 ng/mL, IQR = 4300–6888 ng/mL) and TT (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 4408 ng/mL, IQR = 3361–5233 ng/mL) was recorded. There was a statistically significant difference in LPV *C* _trough_ between all three genotypes for rs4149032 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism (*P* = .007). When LPV *C* _trough_ values were compared between different genotypes it was observed that LPV *C* _trough_ was statistically lower for TT and CT genotypes in comparison with CC genotypes carriers (*P* = .043 and *P* = .002, respectively).

In contrast to the previous two polymorphism, for rs4149056 a trend of increasing LPV plasma *C* _trough_ from wild genotype TT (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 5434 ng/mL, IQR = 3855–6830 ng/mL) to TC (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 6707 ng/mL, IQR = 5088–8063 ng/mL) and CC (LPV median *C* _trough_ = 13906 ng/mL, IQR = 12946–14866 ng/mL) was observed. There was a statistically significant difference in LPV *C* _trough_ between all three genotypes for rs4149056 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism (*P* = .002). When LPV *C* _trough_ was compared between different genotypes it was observed that LPV plasma *C* _trough_ was statistically higher in TC and CC genotypes in comparison with the TT genotype (*P* = .009 and *P* = .011, respectively).

The differences in LPV plasma *C* _trough_ between genotypes of rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism are shown in Figure [1](#bcp14230-fig-0001). In univariate linear regression analysis, rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056 polymorphism was significantly associated with LPV *C* _trough_. The age and BMI of patients and time post dose were not statistically significantly associated with LPV *C* _trough_ in univariate regression analysis (*P* = .056, *P* = .205, *P* = .335). In multivariate regression analysis using backward elimination, only *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 polymorphism was independently associated with LPV *C* _trough_ (β = 2834.5 ng/mL [1442 to 4226.9], *P* = .001) (Table [2](#bcp14230-tbl-0002)). The *SLCO1B1* rs11045819 and *SLCO1B1* rs4149032 polymorphism was not associated with LPV *C* _trough_ (β = −975 ng/mL [−2693.7 to 743.6], *P* = .262; β = 689.4 ng/mL [−984.9 to 2363.8], *P* = .414) in multivariate regression analysis.

## 3. DISCUSSION

In this study we observed the influence of rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056 polymorphism of *SLCO1B1* gene on LPV plasma *C* _trough_ in HIV/AIDS patients, all Caucasians. There was a lack of data on *SLCO1B1* polymorphism in the Serbian population and to our knowledge this is the first study in which *SLCO1B1* polymorphism and its possible influence on LPV *C* _trough_ has been studied in the Serbian population.

The frequencies of alleles of rs11045819 and rs4149032 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism are similar to the frequencies of alleles of other European populations such as British in Great Britain and Scotland, the Iberian population in Spain and Toscani in Italy, while rs4149056 *SLCO1B1* polymorphism allele frequencies were similar to the British and Iberian populations, but statistically different to allele frequencies in the Toscani population in Italy.[36](#bcp14230-bib-0036) For all three polymorphism, allele frequencies were different to allele frequencies obtained in African populations.[36](#bcp14230-bib-0036)

We have observed association of *SLCO1B1* rs11045819 polymorphism and LPV *C* _trough_ in patients only in univariate analysis. Prasad et al. have shown that rs11045819 polymorphism leads to higher expression of OATP1B1 protein on the baso‐lateral membrane of hepatocytes. Higher expression of OATP1B1 leads to higher uptake of LPV in hepatocytes and lower levels of LPV in plasma.[21](#bcp14230-bib-0021), [37](#bcp14230-bib-0037) *SLC01B1* rs11045819 polymorphism is also associated with an increased activity of OATP1B1 transporter that leads to lower LPV *C* _trough_.[38](#bcp14230-bib-0038) The increased expression and activity of OATP1B1 transporter could explain the influence of rs11045819 polymorphism on LPV plasma *C* _trough_ that we have observed.

In univariate analysis we also observed a significant association between *SLCO1B1* rs4149032 polymorphism and lower LPV *C* _trough_. This result is in contrast with results reported by Hartkoorn et al.[19](#bcp14230-bib-0019). Chigutsa et al. have reported that rs4149032 polymorphism, which is prevalent in the African population, is associated with lower rifampin concentration.[39](#bcp14230-bib-0039)

For rs4149056 polymorphism we observed significant association with higher LPV *C* _trough_ in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Prasad et al. observed lower expression of OATP1B1 on hepatocytes of carriers of *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 polymorphism in comparison with carriers of wild‐type genotype.[37](#bcp14230-bib-0037) Lower expression leads to reduced uptake of LPV by hepatocytes and higher levels of LPV in plasma.[37](#bcp14230-bib-0037) Kameyama et al. and Nozawa et al. showed that rs4149056 polymorphism is associated with reduced transport activity of OATP1B1.[40](#bcp14230-bib-0040), [41](#bcp14230-bib-0041) Reduced uptake by hepatocytes leads to higher plasma concentration and reduced clearance of LPV.[21](#bcp14230-bib-0021), [22](#bcp14230-bib-0022), [23](#bcp14230-bib-0023), [42](#bcp14230-bib-0042)

According the results of multivariate linear regression, we have observed that *SLCO1B1* rs11045819 and *SLCO1B1* rs4149032 polymorphism are not associated with LPV *C* _trough._ Our results are in concordance with results reported from Kohlrausch et al., who observed that *SLCO1B1* rs11045819 is not associated with LPV *C* _trough_, but this is in contrast to results reported from Hartkoorn et al., who observed that *SLCO1B1* rs4149032 polymorphism is associated with the pharmacokinetics of LPV.[19](#bcp14230-bib-0019), [23](#bcp14230-bib-0023)

Monitoring LPV *C* _trough_ could have clinical significance, considering that target LPV *C* _trough_ is approximately 1000 ng/mL and that patients with lower LPV *C* _trough_ could experience virologic failure.[30](#bcp14230-bib-0030), [43](#bcp14230-bib-0043) Patients with high LPV *C* _trough_ could experience LPV adverse effects.[28](#bcp14230-bib-0028)

We have for the first time observed the association of polymorphism of rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056 of the *SLCO1B1* gene and LPV *C* _trough_ in the Serbian population. Our data contribute to better understanding the influence of polymorphism of rs11045819, rs4149032 and rs4149056 of *SLCO1B1* gene on LPV *C* _trough_ variability in Caucasian patients from Serbia. However, this study is limited by the lack of data on ritonavir plasma levels in our HIV/AIDS patients.

## 4. CONCLUSIONS

Our data show a statistically significant and independent influence of rs4149056 polymorphism of *SLCO1B1* on higher LPV *C* _trough_ in HIV/AIDS patients, all Caucasians.
