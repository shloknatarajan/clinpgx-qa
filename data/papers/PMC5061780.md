We reported in this journal [3](#bcp13064-bib-0003) that *UGT1A* haplotypes (denoted HapBr) comprising *UGT1A1* rs8175347, *UGT1A3* rs3806596 and *UGT1A3* rs1983023 associate with the dose of levothyroxine (T_4_; 3,5,3′,5′‐triiodo‐l‐thyronine) required for suppression of thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). This association was attributed to reduced UGT1A1 expression and T_4_ glucuronidation in the liver of carriers of low expression *UGT1A1* rs8175347 alleles [3](#bcp13064-bib-0003).

A novel polymorphism (rs11563250 A > G), located in the intergenic region downstream of *UGT1* has been identified recently [4](#bcp13064-bib-0004). Carriers of the minor rs11563250G allele exhibited decreased total bilirubin and reduced risk of irinotecan‐induced neutropenia, compared to carriers of the AA genotype. These findings led to the suggestion that the rs11563250G allele may be associated with elevated UGT1A1 activity and thereby ‘potentially affect the overall conjugation capacity of UGT1A‐targetted substrates’ [4](#bcp13064-bib-0004). Prompted by this suggestion, we examined the impact of rs11563250 A > G on the dose requirement of T_4_, a UGT1A substrate, in our cohort of DTC patients (*n* = 262).

A TaqMan allele discrimination assay (C__32051792_10; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) revealed that the minor allele (rs11563250G) frequency in the study cohort was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.07–0.13); no deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed (χ^2^ test *P* = 0.74). Because of the small number of patients with the variant homozygous genotype (GG, *n* = 2), the cohort was divided into carriers (genotypes AG + GG, *n* = 48) and non‐carriers (AA genotype, *n* = 214) of the rs11563250G allele. A two‐step (univariate followed by multivariate) regression modelling was used to assess the association of rs11563250 with daily T_4_ dose, adjusted to body weight. Body weight was previously shown to be a major determinant of T_4_ dose requirement in this cohort of DTC patients [3](#bcp13064-bib-0003).

Initially, we assessed the independent effect of rs11563250G carriage and observed that the T_4_ dose was, on average 5.2% higher in rs11563250G carriers (2.08 μg/kg, 95% CI 1.97–2.19) compared to non‐carriers (1.97 μg/kg, 1.91–2.03; *P* = 0.13, Student *t*‐test; Figure [1](#bcp13064-fig-0001)A). The direction of this effect was consistent with augmented UGT1A1 activity in rs11563250G carriers, as proposed by Chen *et al*. [4](#bcp13064-bib-0004). Led by these authors’ findings, we repeated the association assessment in two sub‐sets. First, only patients with the *UGT1A1 *1* */*1* genotype, where a considerably larger effect of the rs11563250 A > G SNP was seen: the T_4_ dose was, on average, 12.5% higher in carriers (2.24 μg/kg; 2.08–2.40) than non‐carriers of the rs11563250G allele (1.98 μg/kg; 1.89–2.08; *P* = 0.025; Figure [1](#bcp13064-fig-0001)B). Second, in carriers *vs.* non‐carriers of the haplotype III described by Chen *et al.* [4](#bcp13064-bib-0004), composed by the rs11563250G allele and the wild type allele for *UGT1A1* rs8175347. The T_4_ dose was, on average, 12.3% higher in carriers (2.20 μg/kg, 95% CI 2.03–2.37) compared to non‐carriers (1.96 μg/kg, 1.90–2.02; *P* = 0.023; Figure [1](#bcp13064-fig-0001)C).

Distribution of weight‐adjusted T4 daily dose according to rs11563250 genotype in the overall cohort (A) and in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*1 allele (B), and in carriers vs. non‐carriers of the haplotype III, composed by the rs11563250G allele and the wild type allele for UGT1A1 rs8175347. The number of patients in each group is indicated

Next we performed a multivariable regression analysis, adding the rs11563250 genotype and the number of copies of haplotype III to the variables which were previously shown to associate with daily T_4_ dose in DTC patients [3](#bcp13064-bib-0003). The final regression model retained only *UGT1A* HapBr (*P* = 0.03) and age (*P* < 0.0001) as covariates significantly associated with the body weight‐adjusted T_4_ dose. The final model accounted for 9.7% of the inter‐individual variation in T_4_ dose requirement in our DTC cohort.

In conclusion, our results showed a trend towards higher T_4_ dosage in DTC patients who are carriers of the rs11563250G allele *per se* or in combination with the wild‐type *UGT1A1* rs8175347 allele. This is consistent with the notion of augmented UGT1A activity in rs11563250G carriers [4](#bcp13064-bib-0004), leading to increased UGT1A‐mediated T_4_ glucuronidation in liver. However, rs11563250G carriage was not retained as a covariate associated with T_4_ daily dose in a multivariate regression analysis. We conclude that knowledge of the rs11563250 A > G genotype does not alter our previous proposal [3](#bcp13064-bib-0003) that *UGT1A* haplotypes associate with T_4_ dosage in DTC patients, but the effect accounts for a minor fraction of inter‐individual dose variability and recommendation of *UGT1A* genotyping is not warranted.
