## Abstract

**Aims:** 
Previously, we determined the phenotyping of in vivo nicotine metabolism and the genotyping of the CYP2A6 gene (CYP2A6*1 A, CYP2A6*1B, CYP2A6*2, CYP2A6*3, CYP2A6*4 and CYP2A6*5) in 92 Japanese and 209 Koreans. In the study, we found one Korean and four Japanese subjects genotyped as CYP2A6*1B/CYP2A6*4 who revealed impaired nicotine metabolism, although other many heterozygotes of CYP2A6*4 demonstrated normal nicotine metabolism (CYP2A6*4 is a whole deletion type). After our previous report, several CYP2A6 alleles, CYP2A6*6 (R128Q), CYP2A6*7 (I471T), and CYP2A6*8 (R485L), have been reported. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether the impaired nicotine metabolism can be ascribed to these CYP2A6 alleles. Furthermore, we also determined whether the subjects possessing CYP2A6*1×2 (duplication) reveal higher nicotine metabolism.

**Methods:** 
Genotyping of CYP2A6 alleles, CYP2A6*6, CYP2A6*7, CYP2A6*8, and CYP2A6*1×2 was determined by PCR.

**Results:** 
The five poor metabolizers were re-genotyped as CYP2A6*7/CYP2A6*4, suggesting that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) causing I471T decreases nicotine metabolism in vivo. Furthermore, we found that two subjects out of five with a lower potency of nicotine metabolism possessed SNPs of CYP2A6*7 and CYP2A6*8 simultaneously. The novel allele was termed CYP2A6*10. In the 92 Japanese and 209 Koreans, the CYP2A6*6 allele was not found. The allele frequencies of CYP2A6*7, CYP2A6*8, and CYP2A6*10 were 6.5%, 2.2%, and 1.1%, respectively, in Japanese, and 3.6%, 1.4%, and 0.5%, respectively, in Koreans. The CYP2A6*1×2 allele was found in only one Korean subject (0.5%) whose nicotine metabolic potency was not very high.

**Conclusions:** 
It was clarified that the impaired in vivo nicotine metabolism was caused by CYP2A6*7 and CYP2A6*10 alleles.

### Aims

Previously, we determined the phenotyping of *in vivo* nicotine metabolism and the genotyping of the *CYP2A6* gene (*CYP2A6***1 A*, *CYP2A6***1B*, *CYP2A6***2*, *CYP2A6***3, CYP2A6***4* and *CYP2A6***5*) in 92 Japanese and 209 Koreans. In the study, we found one Korean and four Japanese subjects genotyped as *CYP2A6***1B/CYP2A6***4* who revealed impaired nicotine metabolism, although other many heterozygotes of *CYP2A6***4* demonstrated normal nicotine metabolism (*CYP2A6***4* is a whole deletion type). After our previous report, several *CYP2A6* alleles, *CYP2A6***6* (R128Q)*, CYP2A6***7* (I471T), and *CYP2A6***8* (R485L), have been reported. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether the impaired nicotine metabolism can be ascribed to these *CYP2A6* alleles. Furthermore, we also determined whether the subjects possessing *CYP2A6***1×2* (duplication) reveal higher nicotine metabolism.

### Methods

Genotyping of *CYP2A6* alleles, *CYP2A6***6, CYP2A6***7, CYP2A6***8*, and *CYP2A6***1×2* was determined by PCR.

### Results

The five poor metabolizers were re-genotyped as *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***4*, suggesting that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) causing I471T decreases nicotine metabolism *in vivo*. Furthermore, we found that two subjects out of five with a lower potency of nicotine metabolism possessed SNPs of *CYP2A6***7* and *CYP2A6***8* simultaneously. The novel allele was termed *CYP2A6***10*. In the 92 Japanese and 209 Koreans, the *CYP2A6***6* allele was not found. The allele frequencies of *CYP2A6***7*, *CYP2A6***8, and CYP2A6***10* were 6.5%, 2.2%, and 1.1%, respectively, in Japanese, and 3.6%, 1.4%, and 0.5%, respectively, in Koreans. The *CYP2A6***1×2* allele was found in only one Korean subject (0.5%) whose nicotine metabolic potency was not very high.

### Conclusions

It was clarified that the impaired *in vivo* nicotine metabolism was caused by *CYP2A6***7* and *CYP2A6***10* alleles.

## Introduction

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a superfamily of haemoproteins, many of which can metabolize xenobiotics such as procarcinogens, drugs, and environmental pollutants. CYP2A6 is a major hepatic member of the family in humans, which metabolizes pharmaceutical agents such as coumarin (+) - *cis* - 3,5 - dimethyl - 2 - (3 - pyridyl) thiazolidin-4-one hydrochloride (SM-12502), methoxyflurane, halothane, losigamone, letrozole, valproic acid, disulfiram, fadrozole, and activates some procarcinogens such as 4-methylnitrosoamino-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and *N*-nitrosodiethylamine [[1](#b1)]. Especially, CYP2A6 is a major metabolic enzyme of nicotine. Nicotine is metabolized to cotinine by CYP2A6 [[2](#b2)], and cotinine is further metabolized to *trans*-3′-hydroxycotinine [[3](#b3)]. Nicotine metabolism is known to show large interindividual differences [[4](#b4), [5](#b5)]. Previously, we established a phenotyping method of *in vivo* nicotine metabolism [[6](#b6)]. Furthermore, we determined the relationship between the interindividual differences in nicotine metabolism and genetic polymorphism of the *CYP2A6* gene (*CYP2A6***1 A, CYP2A6***1B, CYP2A6***2, CYP2A6***3, CYP2A6***4*, and *CYP2A6***5*) in 92 Japanese and 209 Koreans [[7](#b7), [8](#b8)]. The *CYP2A6***1 A* is a wild type of the *CYP2A6* gene. The *CYP2A6***1B* allele has a gene conversion with *CYP2A7* in the 3′-untranslated region [[9](#b9)]. The *CYP2A6***2* allele has a single amino acid substitution (L160H) and encodes an unstable and catalytically inactive enzyme [[10](#b10)]. The *CYP2A6***3* allele has gene conversions with *CYP2A7* in exons 3, 6, and 8 [[11](#b11)], proposed to be inactive. The *CYP2A6***4* allele deletes the whole *CYP2A6* gene [[12](#b12), [13](#b13)]. The *CYP2A6***5* allele has a point mutation in exon 9 leading to a single amino acid substitution (G479V) as well as gene conversion in the 3′-untranslated region [[9](#b9)]. In our previous studies [[7](#b7), [8](#b8)], seven Japanese and five Korean subjects were phenotyped as poor metabolizers of cotinine formation from nicotine with probit analyses. Among them, three Japanese and four Korean subjects who were absolutely deficient in cotinine formation were genotyped as *CYP2A6***4/CYP2A6***4*. The other poor metabolizers whose nicotine metabolism was impaired were genotyped as *CYP2A6***1B/CYP2A6***4*, indicating the possibility of the presence of some other mutation(s) in the *CYP2A6***1B* allele in those subjects. Therefore, the alleles had been tentatively termed *CYP2A6***1B(unknown)/CYP2A6***4* [[8](#b8)].

Recently, several new *CYP2A6* alleles have been reported [[14](#b14)–[16](#b16)]. The *CYP2A6***6* allele has a point mutation in exon 3 leading to a single amino acid substitution (R128Q) [[14](#b14)]. It has been reported that the coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity of the CYP2A6.6 enzyme expressed in insect cells with baculovirus was significantly reduced. The *CYP2A6***7* and *CYP2A6***8* alleles have point mutations in exon 9, each leading to a single amino acid substitution, I471T and R485L, respectively [[15](#b15)]. These mutations link to *CYP2A6***1B*. The CYP2A6.7 enzyme expressed in *E. coli* are almost lacking in nicotine *C*-oxidase activity and show reduced coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity. However, the effects of the *CYP2A6***8* allele on CYP2A6 activity are still unclear. The *CYP2A6***1×2* allele has a *CYP2A6* gene duplication [[16](#b16)]. This allele is considered to be the reciprocal product of the *CYP2A6***4* allele after the unequal crossover event between the 3′-flanking region of the *CYP2A6* and *CYP2A7* genes. It has been reported the smokers who possess the *CYP2A6***1×2* allele appeared to show higher cotinine concentrations in plasma than do homozygotes of *CYP2A6***1* [[16](#b16)]. In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 5 (T670C) leading to a single amino acid substitution of S224P has been reported [[17](#b17)]. The effects of the SNP on the CYP2A6 activity are unknown. In the present study, to clarify further the relationships between nicotine metabolism and genetic polymorphism in the *CYP2A6* gene, we determined several *CYP2A6* alleles recently reported in the subjects whose *in vivo* nicotine metabolism had been previously phenotyped [[7](#b7), [8](#b8)].

## Methods

### Chemicals and reagents

Takara LA Taq DNA polymerase and Takara Ex Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara (Kyoto, Japan), and Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Greiner Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), Takara, or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals and solvents were of the highest grade commercially available.

### Phenotyping of in vivo nicotine metabolism

In our previous studies [[7](#b7), [8](#b8)], 92 Japanese and 209 Korean subjects were phenotyped for *in vivo* nicotine metabolism. Briefly, the subjects chewed one piece of nicotine gum (Nicorette®, containing 2 mg nicotine, Pharmacia & Upjohn Co, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min, chewing for 10 s per 30 s. Blood samples were collected from a cubital vein just before and 2 h after the start of chewing. The concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in the plasma samples were determined by h.p.l.c. as described previously [[18](#b18)]. The cotinine/nicotine ratio of the plasma concentration was calculated as an index of nicotine metabolism. Probit transformations of the data were conducted by plotting the cotinine/nicotine ratios of the plasma concentration against their corresponding percent areas under the normal probability curve on probability paper [[19](#b19)]. The cotinine/nicotine ratios of the plasma concentration were ranked from the lowest to the highest value, and the percent area under the normal probability curve was calculated for each data point. The percent area under the normal probability curve was 100 × i/(n + 1), where i is the rank of the data point and n is the sample size.

### Genotyping of CYP2A6 alleles

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using a Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Primers used in the present study are shown in [Table 1](#tbl1). The genotyping of *CYP2A6***1B*, *CYP2A6***2*, *CYP2A6***3*, *CYP2A6***4*, and *CYP2A6***5* was previously performed in our laboratory [[7](#b7), [8](#b8)]. In present study, genotyping of *CYP2A6***1×2*, **6*, **7*, **8* was performed for all subjects. The genotyping of T670C (S224P) was performed for only 92 Japanese. The *CYP2A6***7* allele was genotyped according to the method reported by Ariyoshi *et al.* [[15](#b15)] with two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the first PCR, primers of 2A6ex8F and 2A6R1 were used, and for the second PCR, primers 2 A-wt or 2 A-mt and 2A6R2 were used. The *CYP2A6***1×2* allele was genotyped by the method previously reported by Rao *et al.* [[16](#b16)]. The primers 2A6ex8F or 2A7ex8F and 2A7R1 were used.

Table 1 Caption: Sequence of the primers used in the present study.

In a previous report by Kitagawa *et al.* [[14](#b14)], for the detection of *CYP2A6***6*, PCR products of exon 3 were digested with *Msp* I with the PCR-PFLP method. The restriction enzyme *Msp* I digests PCR products derived from *CYP2A6***1* but not those derived from *CYP2A6***6* and *CYP2A7*. Therefore, if exon 3 in the *CYP2A7* gene were nonspecifically amplified in the PCR, the digestion pattern with *Msp* I would lead to a misclassification of *CYP2A6***6*. Therefore, we improved the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method as described below, using a restriction enzyme of *Aor51H* I which is specific for *CYP2A6***6*. In the first PCR reaction, regions from exon 1 to the 3′-untranslated region of the *CYP2A6* gene were specifically amplified with the primers of 2A6ex1 and 2A6-UTRAS1. The first LA-PCR product was used as a template for the second PCR with the primers of 2A6 E3F and 2A6 E3R. These PCR conditions were described previously [[6](#b6)]. A PCR product of 202 bp was digested with *Aor51H* I. The digested fragments were analysed in a 3.5% NuSieve 3 : 1 gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The wild type of the *CYP2A6* gene yielded a 202-bp fragment and the *CYP2A6***6* allele yielded 159 and 43 bp fragments ([Figure 1a](#fig01)).

(c) Schematic PCR-RFLP patterns for the detection of SNP of T670C (S224P).

An allele specific (AS)-PCR method for the detection of the *CYP2A6***8* allele was developed in the present study. The first PCR was performed with primers of 2A6ex8F and 2A6R1 according to the method of Oscarson *et al.* [[13](#b13)]. The first PCR products were used as a template for the second PCR with the primers of 2A6*8-wt or 2A6*8-mut and 2A6R2. The reaction mixture contained the first PCR product (1.0 µl), 1 X PCR buffer (Greiner), 1.5 mm MgCl_2_, 0.25 mm dNTPs, 0.4 µm each primer, and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Greiner) in a final volume of 25 µl. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3.0 min, the amplification was performed by denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 18 cycles. The expected size of the PCR product was 394 bp. An aliquot (5 µl) of the PCR product was analysed by electrophoresis using 0.8% agarose gel ([Figure 1b](#fig01)).

Genotyping method for the detection of T670C (S224P) reported by Daigo *et al.* [[17](#b17)] was developed in our laboratory with PCR-RFLP. CYP2A6 specific PCR was accomplished with the primers of 2A6 int4 and 2A6 int5. The reaction mixture contained approximately 50 ng genomic DNA, 1 X PCR buffer (Takara), 0.25 mm dNTP, 0.4 µm each primer, 1 U of Ex Taq polymerase (Takara) in a final volume of 25 µl. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, the amplification was performed by denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. A PCR product of 532 bp was digested with *Mbo* II restriction enzyme. The digestion patterns were determined by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gel. The wild type of the *CYP2A6* gene (T/T) yielded 263, 228, and 41 bp fragments and the mutant type (C/C) yielded 491 and 41 bp fragments ([Figure 1c](#fig01)).

### DNA sequencing

To confirm the presence of *CYP2A6***10*, DNA sequencing analysis was performed. The PCR product with the primers of 2A6ex8F and 2A6R1 from the subject who was genotyped as a heterozygote of *CYP2A6***10/CYP2A6***4* was subcloned into pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The plasmid DNA was purified by QIAGEN Plasmid Midi kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and submitted to DNA sequencing using a Thermo Sequenase Cy5.5 Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) with T7F primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA sequences were analysed on a Long-Read Tower DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

### Data analysis

Ethnic differences in metabolic ratios in the different genotype groups were tested by Mann–Whitney *U*-test. *P* < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results and Discussion

The cotinine/nicotine ratios of the different CYP2A6 genotype groups are shown in [Table 2](#tbl2). As we previously reported [[8](#b8)], in total subjects, Korean subjects (8.73 ± 11.88) revealed a significantly (*P* < 0.005) higher metabolic ratio than Japanese subjects (3.78 ± 3.09). Furthermore, in the genotypes *of CYP2A6***1 A/CYP2A6***1 A* (7.42 ± 6.56 *vs* 4.13 ± 3.00, *P* < 0.005), *CYP2A6***1 A/CYP2A6***1B* (10.4 ± 16.89 *vs* 6.05 ± 3.99, *P* < 0.05), *CYP2A6***1B/CYP2A6***1B* (12.53 ± 9.70 *vs* 4.94 ± 3.49, *P* < 0.005), *CYP2A6***1 A/CYP2A6***4* (4.79 ± 3.17 *vs* 2.55 ± 1.22, *P* < 0005), and *CYP2A6***1 A/CYP2A6***7* (6.27 ± 4.76 *vs* 1.47 ± 0.92, *P* < 0.05), the mean metabolic ratios in the Koreans were significantly higher than those in the Japanese. The allele frequencies of *CYP2A6* in Japanese and Koreans are also shown in [Table 2](#tbl2). Among the present 92 Japanese and 209 Koreans, no *CYP2A6***6* allele was found. Three DNA samples genotyped as heterozygotes of *CYP2A6***6* by their method were kindly provided by Drs Kitagawa and Kawamoto (University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyusyu, Japan). However, these DNA samples were not genotyped as *CYP2A6***6* with our improved genotyping method using *Aor51H* I that is specific for the *CYP2A6***6* allele. In their analysis [[14](#b14)], only just a part of exon 3 from the PCR product was analysed. In contrast, in our genotyping method, after the almost complete *CYP2A6* gene (from exon 1 to 3′-untranslated region) was amplified, exon 3 was amplified with the first PCR product as a template. Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that the SNP in *CYP2A6***6* allele might be from a certain pseudogene, because the *CYP2A6***6* allele was not amplified with our improved PCR method. Previously, Kitagawa *et al.* [[14](#b14)] reported that the allele frequency of *CYP2A6***6* was 0.4% in 894 Japanese studied. Our contradictory results might be due to the small sample size compared with their study.

As reported by Ariyoshi *et al.* [[15](#b15)], we confirmed that the T1412C mutation in the *CYP2A6***7* allele was not found on the *CYP2A6***1 A* allele. In the present study, the allele frequencies of *CYP2A6***7* in the Japanese and the Koreans were 6.5% and 3.6%, respectively. Although the allele frequency of *CYP2A6***7* was previously reported to be 15.7%[[15](#b15)], the inconsistency in the allele frequencies would be due to the small sample size analysed by Ariyoshi *et al.* [[15](#b15)] (only 21 subjects). Ariyoshi *et al.* [[15](#b15)] also reported the presence of *CYP2A6***8* allele. However, the frequency of the *CYP2A6***8* allele is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, the genotyping method for *CYP2A6***8* was developed to determine the allele frequency. The allele frequencies of *CYP2A6***8* in the Japanese and the Koreans were 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. We also confirmed that the G1454T mutation in the *CYP2A6***8* allele was not found on the *CYP2A6***1 A* allele. In the process of performing the *CYP2A6***7* and *CYP2A6***8* genotyping, two subjects were genotyped as *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***4* and *CYP2A6***8/CYP2A6***4* as well. Since the *CYP2A6***4* allele is a whole deletion type, the results suggested the presence of an allele possessing two SNPs of T1412C (*CYP2A6***7*) and G1454T (*CYP2A6***8*) simultaneously on an allele. The novel allele was termed as *CYP2A6***10*. Therefore, the two subjects were re-classified as *CYP2A6***10/CYP2A6***4*. Furthermore, since two other subjects were genotyped as homozygotes of *CYP2A6***7* as well as heterozygotes of *CYP2A6***8,* they were re-classified as *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***10*. We confirmed the DNA sequence of *CYP2A6***10* from DNA samples from a subject genotyped as *CYP2A6***10/CYP2A6***4* ([Figure 2](#fig02)). The allele frequencies of *CYP2A6***10* in the Japanese and the Koreans were 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively.

The electrophoregram of CYP2A6 gene sequence of exon 9 in a subject genotyped as CYP2A6*10/CYP2A6*4. Arrows indicate the nucleotides substituted in the CYP2A6*10 allele.

Rao *et al.* [[16](#b16)] reported that the frequency of the *CYP2A6***1×2* was 1.7% (5/296) in Caucasians. In the present study, one Korean subject possessed the *CYP2A6***1×2* allele. Therefore, the frequency was 0.5% (1/209) in Koreans. We first found the *CYP2A6***1×2* allele in an Oriental. However, there was no *CYP2A6***1×2* allele in Japanese subjects. Finally, one Japanese subject was heterozygote of T670C (S224P) allele.

In our previous studies [[7](#b7), [8](#b8)], one Korean and four Japanese subjects who had been genotyped as *CYP2A6***1B/CYP2A6***4* were phenotyped as poor metabolizers of nicotine. In the present study, these subjects were re-genotyped as *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***4* or *CYP2A6***10/CYP2A6***4*([Figure 3](#fig03)). It has been reported that CYP2A6.7 expressed in *E. coli* lacked *in vitro* nicotine *C*-oxidase activity [[15](#b15)]. Therefore, the present study could directly prove that the *CYP2A6***7* allele decreases the CYP2A6 activity *in vivo*. The nicotine metabolism potencies in two subjects genotyped as *CYP2A6***10/CYP2A6***4* (cotinine/nicotine ratio, 0.07 and 0.09) were lower than those in the three subjects genotyped as *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***4* (cotinine/nicotine ratio, 0.24, 0.32, and 0.46), indicating the SNP of *CYP2A6***8* (G1454T) might also decrease the CYP2A6 activity ([Table 2](#tbl2)). However, there was no *in vitro* study to determine the effect of SNP of *CYP2A6***8* allele on the CYP2A6 activity. Furthermore, in the present study, there was no subject homozygous for *CYP2A6***8/CYP2A6***8* and heterozygous for *CYP2A6***8/CYP2A6***4.* Thus, the effects of SNP of *CYP2A6***8* on CYP2A6 activity *in vivo* are still unclear. In our previous studies [[7](#b7), [8](#b8)], the antimode was determined as 0.6 of cotinine/nicotine ratio by the probit analysis. However, the present study revealed that the extensive metabolizers near to the antimode who were genotyped as *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***7* (cotinine/nicotine ratio, 0.82, 1.02, and 1.10), *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***10* (cotinine/nicotine ratio, 0.73 and 1.75), or *CYP2A6***7/CYP2A6***4* (cotinine/nicotine ratio, 0.76, 1.46, 1.48, and 3.40) showed a lower potency of nicotine metabolism ([Figure 3](#fig03), [Table 2](#tbl2)). The discordance of genotype and phenotype in these subjects possibly suggested that the phenotyping of *in vivo* nicotine metabolism might be affected by some factor(s) other than genetic factors, such as diet or environmental factors.

Probit analysis for the cotinine/nicotine ratio of the plasma concentration 2 h after chewing one piece of nicotine gum in 92 Japanese and 209 Koreans. The abscissa denotes the cotinine/nicotine ratio of the plasma concentration in different individuals. The ordinate represents the percent area under the normal probability curve for each data point. The arrow represents the antimode of the probit plot.

In the present study, one Korean subject possessing the *CYP2A6***1×2* allele did not show the highest potency of nicotine metabolism. It has been reported that smokers who possess the *CYP2A6***1×2* allele have higher plasma cotinine levels than homozygous wild type smokers [[16](#b16)]. However, their phenotyping was performed under a condition in which the nicotine intake was not controlled. Therefore, it is still unclear whether the existence of the *CYP2A6***1×2* allele could increase nicotine metabolism.

In conclusion, we clarified that impaired nicotine metabolism is due to the genetic polymorphism of *CYP2A6* gene. The CYP2A6 enzymatic activity is lost in the subjects homozygous for either *CYP2A6***4*, *CYP2A6***7*, or *CYP2A6***10*, or heterozygous for these alleles in combination.
