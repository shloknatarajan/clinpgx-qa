## Abstract

Voriconazole is the standard treatment for invasive aspergillosis but requires therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize therapy. We report two cases of central nervous system aspergillosis treated with voriconazole.

## TEXT

We report here two cases of central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis treated with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided voriconazole therapy. We identified low voriconazole (VCZ) trough plasma concentrations (TC) to be associated with therapeutic failure.

### Case 1.

A 75-year-old white woman with a history of kidney transplantation, treated with tacrolimus and steroids, was admitted to the hospital because of right-side hemiparesis. Four months before admission, she presented with a left oculomotor nerve palsy, which revealed sphenoidal sinusitis complicated by internal carotid artery aneurysms that were treated by vascular embolization.

Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed two cerebral abscesses located in the left occipital and frontal region and sphenoidal sinusitis. Galactomannan antigen (0.78) in serum and *Aspergillus* fumigatus PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid were positive. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) treatment was started initially; voriconazole was introduced 7 days later in combination.

Three weeks later, L-AmB was discontinued because of renal failure. VCZ TC were inferior to 1 mg/liter with a standard weight dose (patient weight, 45 kg), despite concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) administration. Voriconazole doses were thus gradually increased to 350 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) (8 mg/kg of body weight b.i.d.) ([Fig. 1A](#F1)).

Antifungal trough concentrations and outcome of patients 1 (A) and 2 (B). Time zero corresponds to the diagnosis of cerebral aspergillosis. qd, once a day; bid, twice a day; tid, three times a day. IV, intravenous administration; PO, oral administration; ISA, isavuconazole; ARF, acute renal failure (creatinine, >200 μmol/liter); TC, tonic-clonic. *, voriconazole was stopped for visual hallucinations and restarted 2 days later at 200 mg b.i.d.; **, voriconazole had been reduced to 200 mg b.i.d. because of cholestasis (alkaline phosphatase, 572 IU/liter; gamma-glutamyltransferase, 591 IU/liter).

At month 2 (M2), MRI showed a stability of the two cerebral abscesses but an extension of the infection to anterior ethmoidal air cells and to the left temporal lobe. A sinus biopsy specimen identified necrosis with intralesional septate hyphae, but mycological culture remained negative. From M3 to M7, minimal clinical improvement was noted and cerebral lesions on MRI were stable. Target VCZ TC (2 to 5 mg/liter) were difficult to achieve despite high doses of VCZ (8 mg/kg b.i.d.). The median TC was 1.7 mg/liter (range, <0.2 to 6.8 mg/liter), and 60% of the TC were <2 mg/liter.

A homozygous gain-of-function (GOF) mutation in CYP2C19*17 (rs12248560) was then identified in this patient, and treatment was changed to isavuconazole 200 mg once a day (q.d.) and then increased to 300 mg q.d. to obtain a good TC. Four months after isavuconazole introduction, the clinical outcome was favorable, with a marked improvement of the right-side hemiparesis despite stability of the fungal lesions seen on MRI.

### Case 2.

A 39-year-old white woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was admitted to the hospital because of febrile headaches. MRI showed a frontal abscess with peripheral edema. Fungal cultures of a cerebral biopsy specimen grew *Aspergillus fumigatus* susceptible to triazoles. She received 2 weeks of L-AmB treatment. Voriconazole was added in combination after 1 week of L-AmB. MRI showed stability of the frontal abscess 1 month after voriconazole introduction.

At M3, she was treated with one cycle of bendamustine for CLL progression with high-count lymphocytosis (200 × 10^3^/μl) and anemia. After 12 days of neutropenia, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. MRI showed worsening of the frontal lesion (20 by 14 mm versus 18 by 11 mm) with an intralesional hemorrhagic component and increased perilesional edema and the appearance of an occipital annular enhancement.

The VCZ TC was low (0.79 mg/liter) despite oral therapy with 650 mg per day divided into 2 intakes (patient weight, 55 kg) ([Fig. 1B](#F1)). The median VCZ TC was 1 mg/liter (range, 0.3 to 3.6 mg/liter), and 80% of the VCZ TC were <2 mg/liter. Caspofungin was added to voriconazole, and voriconazole was increased to a very high dose (400 mg three times a day [t.i.d.]; 7 mg/kg t.i.d.) to reach a TC of >2 mg/liter. Genotyping showed a heterozygous GOF mutation in CYP2C19*1/*17 (rs12248560). One month after combined and adjusted doses of VCZ, MRI showed the disappearance of the perilesional edema and the occipital annular enhancement.

We have reported two cases of cerebral aspergillosis with gain-of-function mutations of CYP2C19 that were partially responsible for the therapeutic failure of voriconazole. VCZ is the reference treatment for invasive aspergillosis, but TDM is mandatory for obtaining adequate TC and a favorable outcome ([1](#B1)[–](#B2)[3](#B3)). Current guidelines suggest TC of >1 to 1.5 mg/liter, but higher TC (>2 mg/liter) are recommended for treating cerebral aspergillosis ([2](#B2), [4](#B4), [5](#B5)).

In these two cases, optimal TC were difficult to reach despite very high doses of VCZ.

VCZ is metabolized mainly by the hepatic CYP2C19. We identified homozygous CYP2C19*17 and a CYP2C19*1/*17 polymorphisms responsible for ultrarapid and rapid metabolizer phenotypes. CYP2C19 polymorphisms directly impact serum levels, as it was shown that the twice-daily doses to achieve adequate TC were higher with CYP2C19*17/17 (6.8 mg/kg) and CYP2C19*1/*17 (3.9 mg/kg) than with CYP2C19*1/*1 (2.6 mg/kg) ([6](#B6)). The frequency of CYP2C19*17/17 and CYP2C19*1/*17 are 2 to 5% and 2 to 30% of patients, respectively ([7](#B7)).

Concomitant treatment with omeprazole, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, has successfully increased voriconazole concentrations in some case reports but had no impact in our case 1 ([8](#B8)). In case 2, with a heterozygous mutation, high doses of voriconazole were sufficient to obtain adequate TC, and the combination with caspofungin led to clinical improvement. When an adequate TC is not reached with a high dose of voriconazole, especially for a homozygous CYP2C19*17 mutation similar to that in our case 1, switching to combination therapy or isavuconazole has to be considered ([7](#B7), [9](#B9)). Isavuconazole is principally metabolized by CYP3A4 and is not impacted by CYP2C19 polymorphisms, but its efficacy has to be confirmed for CNS aspergillosis. Guidelines for the use of voriconazole in cases of CYP2C19 polymorphisms were recently published and recommend the use of a drug other than voriconazole, which is not metabolized by CYP2C19 in cases of ultrarapid and rapid metabolizer phenotypes ([7](#B7)).

Regarding an optimal TDM protocol, recent ESCMID guidelines recommend that TC be monitored 2 to 5 days after initiation of therapy and repeated the week after to confirm that the TC are adequate ([5](#B5)). In addition, we also suggest that TC be monitored 5 days after any dose modification.

Therapeutic failure in case 1 might also be due to an azole-resistant *Aspergillus* sp. strain, as the diagnosis was based on galactomannan antigen detected in serum and *A. fumigatus* in the cerebrospinal fluid, determined by PCR. Nevertheless, the frequency of the azole-resistant strain remains very low (<1%) in France ([10](#B10)), and the therapeutic response was favorable with another triazole, isavuconazole.

In conclusion, we suggest systematic CYP2C19 genotyping in cases of severe aspergillosis, mainly CNS aspergillosis, to avoid effective therapy delay in patients harboring the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype.
