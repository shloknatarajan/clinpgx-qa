## Abstract

**Background:** 
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an iatrogenic involuntary movement disorder occurring after extended antipsychotic use with unclear pathogenesis. CYP2D6 is a liver enzyme involved in antipsychotic metabolism and a well-studied gene candidate for TD.

**Materials & methods:** 
We tested predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype with TD occurrence and severity in our two samples of European chronic schizophrenia patients (total n = 198, of which 82 had TD).

**Results:** 
TD occurrence were associated with extreme metabolizer phenotype, controlling for age and sex (p = 0.012). In other words, individuals with either increased and no CYP2D6 activity were at higher risk of having TD.

**Conclusion:** 
Unlike most previous findings, TD occurrence may be associated with both extremes of CYP2D6 metabolic activity rather than solely for poor metabolizers.

### Background:

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an iatrogenic involuntary movement disorder occurring after extended antipsychotic use with unclear pathogenesis. *CYP2D6* is a liver enzyme involved in antipsychotic metabolism and a well-studied gene candidate for TD.

### Materials & methods:

We tested predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype with TD occurrence and severity in our two samples of European chronic schizophrenia patients (total n = 198, of which 82 had TD).

### Results:

TD occurrence were associated with extreme metabolizer phenotype, controlling for age and sex (p = 0.012). In other words, individuals with either increased and no CYP2D6 activity were at higher risk of having TD.

### Conclusion:

Unlike most previous findings, TD occurrence may be associated with both extremes of CYP2D6 metabolic activity rather than solely for poor metabolizers.

## Materials & methods

To add to the existing literature, we aimed to study the possible association between genotype-predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype (or CYP2D6 metabolizer status) and TD in two sample sets of European ancestry. The study was approved by individual institutional review boards and is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was given by each study participant. The first sample set (CAUS) included 148 participants from two countries (Canada and USA) whose sample characteristics have been described previously [[28–30](#B28)]. In short, participants were enrolled from four sites throughout North America: Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in ON, Canada (G Remington; n = 97); Case Western Reserve University in OH, USA (DHY Meltzer; n = 41); Hillside Hospital in NY, USA (JA Lieberman; n = 12); and the University of California at Irvine, CA, USA (SG Potkin; n = 8). Participants had either DSM-III-R or DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (American Psychiatric Association). Patients recruited in the USA had no prior exposure to atypical antipsychotics, while the chronic patients from Canada may have been on either typical or atypical antipsychotics. All patients, however, had been exposed to typical antipsychotics for at least one year before being assessed for TD. The rate of TD was not significantly different between the USA and Canadian subsamples (p = 0.626), but was significantly lower in males (65%) when compared with females (35%) in the sample (p = 0.034).

Our second sample set (PGx) consisted of schizophrenia or schizoaffective patients from a naturalistic pharmacogenetics study (The Individualized Medicine: Pharmacogenetics Assessment and Clinical Treatment) (n = 58) with 19 TD cases [[31](#B31),[32](#B32)]. A summary of sample characteristics is shown in [Table 1](#T1).

### Table 1. . Demographic information on the CAUS and pharmacogenomic schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patient samples included in the study.

| Samples | CAUS | PGx |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n (TD+/TD-) | 148 (63/85) | 58 (19/39) |
| Sex (male/female) | 97/51 | 45/13 |
| Mean age in years (standard deviation) | 39.01 (10.50) | 41.10 (13.42) |
| CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype (PM/IM/EM/UM) | 6/11/123/8 | 4/6/48/0 |

Table 1 Caption: EM: Extensive metabolizer; IM: Intermediate metabolizer; PGx: Pharmacogenomic; PM: Poor metabolizer; TD: Tardive dyskinesia; UM: Ultra-rapid metabolizer.

TD classification was based on the Schooler and Kane criteria, using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) or the modified Hillside Simpson Dyskinesia Scale for the 12 patients recruited from the Hillside Hospital [[33](#B33),[34](#B34)]. As per the aforementioned criteria, presence of TD included at least one moderate rating or at least two mild ratings on the first seven items of the AIMS. AIMS scores were available for 194 European participants in our sample.

## Genotyping & analysis

For the CAUS sample, we genotyped nine SNPs (rs1135840, rs16947, rs28371706, rs28371725, rs35742686, rs3892097, rs5030655, rs5030656 and rs1065852) in the *CYP2D6* gene; these are key variants for the individual star alleles for *CYP2D6*. Genotyping was performed by PCR amplification with the TaqMan genotyping assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ON, Canada) following the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by genotype determination in the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system. We also assessed the copy number of *CYP2D6* using a copy-number assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol in the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. Ten percent of the genotypes were repeated as quality controls, and no mismatches were observed. Genotypes for the PGx sample were extracted from the pharmacogenetic test panel based on the multiplex Luminex xTAG bead array done on cheek swab DNA for all of the SNPs mentioned for CAUS [[35](#B35)]. Using the *CYP2D6* nomenclature, all samples were genotyped for *CYP2D6**1–5, 2xN, 4xN, *10, *17 and *41. The DNA variants associated with these alleles is provided in [Table 2](#T2).

### Table 2. . CYP2D6 DNA variants that are tested in the present study.

| Variant ID | CYP2D6 Allele | Function | Variant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rs16947 | *2 | Normal (wild type) | 2851C>T (R296C) |
| rs1135840 | *2 | Normal | 4181G>C (S486T) |
| rs35742686 | *3 | None | 2550delA (259 frameshift) |
| rs3892097 | *4 | None | 1847G>A (splicing defect/169 frameshift) |
| Copy number | *5 | Gene deletion/duplication | Gene deletion/duplication |
| rs5030655 | *6 | None | 1708delT (152 frameshift) |
| rs5030656 | *9 | Decreased | 2616delAAG (K281del) |
| rs1065852 | *10 | Decreased | 100C>T (P34S) |
| rs28371706 | *17 | Decreased | 1022C>T (T107I) |
| rs28371725 | *41 | Decreased | 2851C>T (R296C) |
We translated the *CYP2D6* genotypes for each participant into an activity score and metabolizer phenotype according to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium system [[36](#B36)]. We conducted logistic regression analysis of TD occurrence and linear regression analysis of log-transformed AIMS scores separately for the CAUS and PGx samples, taking into account age and sex as covariates (SPSS).

## Results

Inspection of the boxplot for the CAUS sample ([Figure 1](#F1)A) revealed a U-shaped trend that shows that individuals categorized as being CYP2D6 PM or UM (each UM having three copies of functional *CYP2D6*) appear to have higher average total AIMS scores than those categorized as being CYP2D6 EM and IM, controlling of sex and age (beta = 0.277; 95% CI: 0.025–0.530; p = 0.032). Logistic regression analysis further revealed that CYP2D6 extreme metabolizer phenotypes were significantly associated with TD occurrence, controlling for sex and age (odds ratio [OR] = 5.580; 95% CI: 1.454–21.410; p = 0.012). However, activity score did not reveal any significant associations with TD in this comparison, controlling for sex and age (OR = 0.987; 95% CI: 0.604–1.612; p = 0.957). The results are summarized in [Table 3](#T3).

Upon visual inspection of the boxplot for the PGx sample ([Figure 1](#F1)B), we noticed individuals with CYP2D6 PM phenotype appeared to have higher AIMS scores than those with other CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes. CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype were associated with TD occurrence, controlling for sex and age (OR = 0.343; 95% CI: 0.119–0.989; p = 0.048; [Table 3](#T3)). A significant association was also found for the logistic regression analysis of activity score and TD, controlling for sex and age (OR = 0.361; 95% CI: 0.139–0.938; p = 0.037; [Table 3](#T3)).

## Discussion

We have conducted an association study of the *CYP2D6* gene in TD occurrence and severity. The association between extreme metabolizer phenotypes and TD presence supports a modulatory role for this gene in the risk of TD development, and ties in previous genetic findings. We observed patients with UM phenotype which, to our knowledge, was tested in only one previous TD study [[27](#B27)].

The majority of previous *CYP2D6* gene association studies with TD suggest that lower activity score, or PMs, incur greater risk for TD [[20](#B20),[21](#B21)]. We were able to support this association with our significant finding of CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype and activity scores with TD occurrence. Although we were unable to confirm the association with TD severity in our PGx sample, we observed trends for both low activity scores and CYP2D6 PM phenotype to be associated with TD severity.

In the CAUS sample, our initial logistic regression analysis between metabolizer phenotype and TD occurrence revealed no significant association. Subsequently, investigation of the boxplot revealed that CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype may have a U-shaped relationship with TD severity. By grouping together the two extreme metabolizer phenotypes, we found the CYP2D6 UM/PM group to have a higher risk for TD and higher TD severity than the IM/EM group. Not only does this confirm previous studies, but also conjoins the two opposing hypotheses regarding *CYP2D6* and TD in that both UM and PM are associated with higher TD risk and severity. Establishing that UM individuals may be predisposed to TD may also suggest that future studies will need to assay for *CYP2D6* gene deletion/duplication in addition to other DNA variants in *CYP2D6* in order to derive more precise metabolizer phenotypes that may unmask the relationship we have observed in this study.

## Conclusion

While the findings from the present study are encouraging, a number of limitations should be considered before drawing firm conclusions. First, an important risk factor in TD development is cumulative drug dose that incorporates treatment duration, medication type and treatment adherence; this information was not available for our samples. As mentioned earlier, certain antipsychotics, mainly FGAs, confer a greater likelihood of developing TD. CYP2D6 falls on either the major or minor metabolic pathway for all antipsychotic drugs. We have not accounted for the effects of other liver enzymes; this might have limited our ability to estimate the effect of CYP2D6 on TD risk and severity. A second limitation is the moderate sample size which affects almost all *CYP2D6* genetic investigations and is reflected in our study by the low counts for PM and UM participants. As many of the alleles which result in the CYP2D6 extreme metabolizer phenotypes are rare in the general population, larger samples will be needed in order to increase the chance of finding more CYP2D6 PM and UM patients. Third, there were a number of covariates that were not taken into account for our analysis. Smoking, drug and alcohol use were not available for all the participants and could have influenced our findings in light of evidence suggesting their role in TD [[2](#B2)]. Smoking in particular is known to induce CYP1A2 enzyme activity, which may in turn influence the steady-state concentrations of certain antipsychotic drugs [[37](#B37),[38](#B38)].

## Future perspective

Moving forward, there are several avenues that can be explored for future studies of the *CYP2D6* gene. First, deep sequencing will identify all *CYP2D6* gene variants in order to increase the accuracy of the predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype that we used in our analysis. Second, testing CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype with TD across ethnic groups would enhance our understanding of the role of this enzyme, especially with higher frequency of CYP2D6 IMs in East Asians and higher frequency of UMs in individuals of African ancestry [[25](#B25),[26](#B26),[39](#B39)]. Third, as we found in our samples, CYP2D6 PMs are not the only individuals who incur greater TD risk. Essentially, in CYP2D6 PMs the inability to lower antipsychotic drug plasma levels might have led to excessively high levels of the drug in the body, resulting in higher TD risk. However, TD risk observed in UMs may not act through the same mechanism. Since CYP2D6 UMs are able to clear the drug at an accelerated rate, the metabolites which result from drug metabolism accumulate in the body as well. This suggests that there may be active metabolites which are involved in the pathophysiology of TD. Additional studies on the effects of drug metabolites on TD and related phenotypes will help us understand the mechanism of the association between CYP2D6 UM and TD. Furthermore, since the levels of most drugs are influenced by more than one liver enzyme and drug transporters, the combined effect of gene panels on drugs of interest should be considered in future pharmacogenetic studies. At last, many chronic schizophrenia patients are often prescribed multiple medications [[40](#B40)], thus drug–drug interactions, which can alter liver enzyme activity, need to be considered [[41–43](#B41)]. Overall though, findings from our current study encourage more in-depth interrogation of liver enzyme genes in TD.
