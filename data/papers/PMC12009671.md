## Abstract

**Objective:** 
To describe patients with NSAID-DILI, including genetic factors associated with idiosyncratic DILI.

**Methods:** 
In DILIN subjects with presumed DILI are enrolled and followed for at least 6 months. Causality is adjudicated by a Delphic approach. HLA sequencing of multiethnic NSAID-DILI patients and HLA allele imputation of matching population controls were performed following overall, class, and drug-based association analysis. Significant results were tested in a Non-Hispanic White (NHW) case-control replication cohort.

**Results:** 
Between Sep 2004 and Mar 2022, causality was adjudicated in 2,498, and 55 [41 (75%) women] were assessed as likely due to NSAIDs. Median age at onset was 55 y [range 22–83 y]. Diclofenac was the causative drug in 29, celecoxib in 7, ibuprofen in 5, etodolac and meloxicam each in 4. Except for meloxicam and oxaprozin [n=2], the liver injury was hepatocellular with median R 15–25. HLA-DRB1*04:03 and HLA-B*35:03 were significantly more frequent in NSAID-DILI patients than in non-NSAID DILI controls. Interestingly, 85% of the HLA-DRB1*04:03 carriers developed DILI due to the use of acetic acid derivative NSAIDs, supporting the hypothesis that HLA-DRB1*04:03 could be a drug and/or class risk factor. HLA-B*35:03 but not HLA-DRB1*04:03 association was confirmed in the independent NHW replication cohort, which was largely driven by diclofenac.

**Conclusions:** 
Despite prevalent use, NSAID-DILI is infrequent in the US. Diclofenac is the most commonly implicated, and adherence to warnings of risk and close observation are recommended. The increased frequency of HLA-B*35:03 and DRB1*04:03, driven by diclofenac, suggests the importance of immune-mediated responses.

### Objective:

To describe patients with NSAID-DILI, including genetic factors associated with idiosyncratic DILI.

### Methods:

In DILIN subjects with presumed DILI are enrolled and followed for at least 6 months. Causality is adjudicated by a Delphic approach. *HLA* sequencing of multiethnic NSAID-DILI patients and *HLA* allele imputation of matching population controls were performed following overall, class, and drug-based association analysis. Significant results were tested in a Non-Hispanic White (NHW) case-control replication cohort.

### Results:

Between Sep 2004 and Mar 2022, causality was adjudicated in 2,498, and 55 [41 (75%) women] were assessed as likely due to NSAIDs. Median age at onset was 55 y [range 22–83 y]. Diclofenac was the causative drug in 29, celecoxib in 7, ibuprofen in 5, etodolac and meloxicam each in 4. Except for meloxicam and oxaprozin [n=2], the liver injury was hepatocellular with median R 15–25. *HLA-DRB1*04:03* and *HLA-B*35:03* were significantly more frequent in NSAID-DILI patients than in non-NSAID DILI controls. Interestingly, 85% of the *HLA-DRB1*04:03* carriers developed DILI due to the use of acetic acid derivative NSAIDs, supporting the hypothesis that *HLA-DRB1*04:03* could be a drug and/or class risk factor. *HLA-B*35:03* but not *HLA-DRB1*04:03* association was confirmed in the independent NHW replication cohort, which was largely driven by diclofenac.

### Conclusions:

Despite prevalent use, NSAID-DILI is infrequent in the US. Diclofenac is the most commonly implicated, and adherence to warnings of risk and close observation are recommended. The increased frequency of *HLA-B*35:03 and DRB1*04:03*, driven by diclofenac, suggests the importance of immune-mediated responses.

## Introduction

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] are widely and chronically used throughout the world, including in the USA. They are among the most widely prescribed and most widely purchased over-the-counter [OTC] medications. Liver injury caused by NSAIDs is ‘idiosyncratic’ [non-dose dependent], unpredictable, and clinically challenging. In fact, several NSAIDs were removed from the US market or ascribed black box warnings because of recognized risks of serious or even fatal drug-induced liver injury [DILI].^1^ The precise pathogenetic basis for idiosyncratic DILI due to NSAIDs remains uncertain. However, based upon the patterns of liver injury [typically hepatocellular] and associated liver histopathology [resembling acute viral hepatitis], it is likely that such injury is immune-mediated, occurring in subjects with genetic susceptibilities to immune-mediated liver and other diseases who are exposed to NSAIDs. A similar pathogenetic pathway has been postulated for most other drugs that cause rare, idiosyncratic DILI.^2–4^

In 2014, the first 9 years of our experience with NSAID-DILI was reported.^5^ The most common single agent was diclofenac; severity was sometimes severe, even fatal, or required urgent liver transplantation. The histopathology was predominantly like that of acute viral hepatitis, although with some variations.^5^ No data about *HLA* typing or other potential genetic correlates with NSAID-DILI were available then. However, several candidate variants located in ADME genes and other genes involved in inflammation were previously suggested to be associated with NSAID/Diclofenac DILI.^6–8^

In this work NSAID-DILI cases enrolled between September 2013—March 2022, are compared to those enrolled earlier, and *HLA* genetic polymorphisms and other genetic factors recently found relevant to DILI are analyzed.^7, 9, 10^ Salient histopathological findings of NSAID-DILI are also summarized.

### Patients and Methods:

The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) is a multicenter observational study established in 2003 to study DILI. Patients aged 2 years and older with suspected DILI and without known underlying autoimmune liver diseases were enrolled both prospectively [within 6 months of liver injury onset] and retrospectively [selected subjects of interest, not enrolled until >6 months after onset of DILI event]. The DILIN definitions of liver injury, approach to excluding competing etiologies, and follow up [6 months per protocol and longer for patients with persistent liver test abnormalities] are described in detail in the [Supplemental Materials](#SD1).

Adjudication of likelihood of DILI was carried out by consensus of expert opinion for each case of suspected DILI, as well as for each implicated agent on a 5-category scale of 1-definite, 2-highly likely, 3-probable, 4-possible and 5-unlikely, as previously described.^11^ Severity of liver injury was similarly assessed as previously described.^11^

The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method [RUCAM] score for each implicated agent was determined by the enrolling principal investigator.^12^ In this study, the recently described revised electronic causality assessment method [RECAM] was also used to score the probability of DILI for each implicated NSAID.^13^ In evaluable cases, RECAM and RUCAM scores were compared according to their respective categories of highly likely, probable, possible and unlikely DILI in relation to the final adjudication category by DILIN expert opinion ([Supplemental Materials](#SD1)).

Demographic and clinical data were compared between patients with NSAID-DILI and patients with non-NSAID-DILI, as were characteristics of liver injury and outcomes. The presence of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) was defined by a modified RegiSCAR score ≥4.^14^

#### Liver histopathology:

Available liver biopsies were reviewed by a single expert liver histopathologist (DEK). These biopsies were scored for multiple histological features as well as an overall pattern of liver injury.^15^

#### Statistical analysis:

Populations are described with summary statistics such as medians with (interquartile ranges) for continuous variables and frequencies with percent for categorical variables. Comparisons between the confirmed NSAID-DILI cases and the confirmed non-NSAID-DILI drug cases were compared by two sample Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables and by chi-square tests for categorical data. All analyses were carried out in SAS version 9.4.

#### Genetic analysis:

52 of the 55 NSAID-DILI reported cases were compared to 28,130 population controls. This is a large, ethnically matched population cohort obtained by merging five dbGaP datasets (see [Supplementary Materials](#SD1)). Cases in the current study had been genotyped either as previously described,^9^ or newly profiled with the Illumina Infinium^®^ Expanded Multi-Ethnic Genotyping (MEGA^EX^) array chip (Vantage Core, Vanderbilt University Medical Center). High resolution *HLA* class I and II typing of all the samples was performed using direct sequencing by Illumina MiSeq as previously described^16^. For controls in the current study four-digit *HLA* alleles were imputed by HIBAG program using available genotype data,^17^ as described in Li et al.^16^. Population stratification of cases and controls was inferred by EIGENSTRAT as described in Li et al.^16^ (see [Supplementary Materials](#SD1)). *HLA* associations were compared using allele frequency and prevalence differences between NSAID-DILI cases and controls and tested by Fisher’s exact test or by Firth-corrected logistic regression with covariate adjustment of gender and the two first principal component axes in analyses using the 52 NSAID-DILI cases. Rare *HLA* alleles, ≤3 carriers among cases, were excluded from the association analysis. The false discovery rate (FDR) using q-value was computed to correct for multiple testing, and alleles with q-value <0.10 were considered significant risk alleles.^18^ Finally, SNP imputation was performed as previously described.^9^ We selected 7 variants previously reported as associated with the NSAID/diclofenac DILI,^6–9^ and case/control association analysis was performed by PLINK as described above.^19^ SNPs associated with p <0.05 were considered significantly associated with the phenotype. Analyses of possible interactions among *HLA* alleles and risk SNPs were also conducted by PLINK.^19^ *HLA* haplotype analysis was performed by the *haplo.score* function in the *haplo.stats* R package with covariate adjustment of gender and the two first principal component axes.^20, 21^ We also tested combinations of *HLA* alleles that have been associated with auto-immune diathesis and diseases.^22^

### Replication cohort of the most significant HLA alleles:

We compared 121 Non-Hispanic White (NHW) cases of NSAID-induced liver injury collected from a number of European centers participating in the DILIGEN and iDILIC studies against 10,397 population controls^10^ to evaluate further the most significant *HLA* findings from DILIN. Causality assessment was performed as previously reported^23^. The cases and controls were previously genotyped and analyzed as a part of the broad GWAS on susceptibility to DILI^10,9^ For both DILI cases and controls four-digit *HLA* alleles were imputed by HIBAG program using available genotype data.^17^ Case/control association analysis was performed by PLINK by logistic regression with covariate adjustment of the ten significant principal component axes.

## Results

### Numbers of Subjects Enrolled and Studied:

Schmeltzer et al characterized NSAID-DILI in 30 cases enrolled in DILIN and adjudicated between 2004 and August 2013.^5^ In the present study, 25 additional subjects with NSAID-DILI with high causality likelihood scores of 1–3, enrolled and adjudicated between September 2013 and March 2022, were included in the study cohort. [Figure 1](#F1) provides a summary flow diagram of subjects studied. For the entire cohort of 55 subjects, 9 [16.4%] were assessed as definitely, 32 [58.2%] as highly-likely, and 14 [25.5%] as probably due to an NSAID. The distribution of causality scores did not differ significantly from those for all non-NSAID drugs.

Summary Flow Diagram of Subjects Studied. Total numbers of subjects studied between September 2004 and March 2022 are shown with the numbers of subjects previously described (studied between September 2004 and August 2013 shown in parentheses). Between September 2004 and Aug 2013, we enrolled 1,322 subjects and, for the earlier paper, had adjudicated causality in 1,221, with 30 ascribed to NSAIDs. Between September 2013—March 2022, we enrolled a similar number of subjects, namely, 1,304, among whom we had adjudicated causality in 1,275, with 25 ascribed to NSAIDs.

There was no observable trend in the overall frequency with which DILI was ascribed to one of the NSAIDs, comparing the first 9 years to the recent 8.5 years [p value for trend test = 0.64].

There also was no striking change in the relative numbers of subjects with DILI ascribed to individual NSAIDs [[Supplemental Table 1](#SD1)]. Diclofenac, with or without misoprostol, was the agent most often implicated, accounting for 29/55 [53%], with celecoxib accounting for 7, ibuprofen for 5, etodolac and meloxicam for 4 each, and oxaprozin accounting for 2 cases.

[Table 1](#T1) summarizes selected demographic and relevant clinical features of all 55 patients, separated into those with hepatocellular type DILI [R ≥5, [Table 1A](#T1)] or with cholestatic or mixed-type DILI [R<5, [Table 1B](#T2)] with comparisons to all other enrolled subjects in whom DILI was ascribed to other ethical drugs [prescription or over-the-counter]. Because of differences among subjects with DILI ascribed to herbals and dietary supplements,^24^ such subjects were not included in the comparison. Among NSAID-DILI subjects with HC-DILI there was a preponderance of women [83%], higher than for the non-NSAID drugs [69%, p = 0.054]. They were also older [median age 54.2 vs 49.3 y, p= 0.036] and had higher BMIs [p = 0.005]. For those with cholestatic/mixed DILI, there was a trend for higher BUN and greater need for liver transplant, and significantly more were treated with corticosteroids, suggesting greater severity. The indications for NSAID use included degenerative or unspecified arthritis/joint pain and muscle pain in 48 (88%), non-musculoskeletal pain or fever in 4 (7%) and other rheumatologic conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and mixed connective tissue disease) in 3 (5%).

Table 1 Caption: Selected clinical, demographic, and laboratory features of NSAID-DILI subjects [2004–2022] with cholestatic or mixed-type DILI [R ≤ 5] vs cholestatic or mixed-type DILI due to other OTC or Prescription Drugs.

**Signs and symptoms** reported at onset of DILI were typical with 35/55 [63.6%] jaundiced, 33/55 [60%] reporting nausea, 24/55 [43.6%] abdominal pain. Smaller numbers reported symptoms typical of immuno-allergic DILI, with fever in 14, rash in 12, and itching in 17/55. The median absolute eosinophil count was 210 [IQR 100–400], and only 9/54 [16.7%] had eosinophil counts > 500/uL.

It is well-known that subjects with cholestatic or mixed type DILI are more likely to experience protracted courses of disease and not to resolve completely within 6 months.^25, 26^ Similarly, 3/5 [60%] of subjects with cholestatic DILI ascribed to NSAIDs went on to chronic DILI.

[Table 2](#T3) describes selected demographic, laboratory, and clinical features set out by the causative drugs. Striking findings include the shorter latencies for oxaprozin and meloxicam [medians of 16 and 22.5 d], as well as for celecoxib [31 d], compared with diclofenac [61 d], ibuprofen [66 d], and etodolac [143 d]. Also noteworthy is that the median R value for diclofenac, the most frequent implicated agent, was 15, for ibuprofen 20.5, and for etodolac 16.5, whereas R values were much lower for meloxicam [1.3], celecoxib [2.5], and oxaprozin [5.4]. The frequencies of ANA and SMA positivity also differed among causative drugs being lowest for celecoxib and ibuprofen. Furthermore, the incidence of chronic DILI was highest with celecoxib but rather infrequent with the other NSAID’s. With one exception [a patient with DILI ascribed to meloxicam], all deaths or need for liver transplantation within 6 months of DILI onset occurred in those with diclofenac or celecoxib DILI.

Table 2 Caption: Comparative Features of NSAID-DILI by Implicated Agent

Because for some drugs, such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, older subjects have lower R values and more cholestatic-type injury,^26, 27^ whether there was a trend for similar results also with NSAID-DILI was assessed. For both higher R values [>5 at entry] and lower R values [R < 5 at entry], similar trends were observed, with Z statistics of −0.8443 [one-sided p = 0.199] and Z = 1.089 [one-sided p = 0.138]; however, they were not significant.

#### RUCAM and RECAM scores:

Scores were both available in 73 patients among 76 subjects with NSAID-DILI (including the 55 DILI cases and 21 possible/unlikely DILI cases). RECAM scores could not be assigned in 3 subjects (2 highly likely cases and one unlikely case) due to missing lab data. The distributions of RECAM and RUCAM scores are shown in box plots compared to scores produced by the DILIN expert consensus Delphic approach [[Supplemental Figure 1](#SD1)]. Both RECAM and RUCAM scores of DILI correlated with DILIN expert opinion. The overall agreement of RECAM scoring vs. RUCAM scoring with expert opinion was 52.1% vs. 46.6% (P=0.46). A more detailed analysis is reported in the [Supplementary Materials](#SD1).

#### Histopathology:

Since the publication of the previous study,^5^ biopsies from 12 additional subjects with DILI ascribed to NSAIDs became available for central review. Associated drugs included diclofenac (5), celecoxib (4), ibuprofen (2), and naproxen (1). Individual case findings are summarized in [Supplemental Table 2](#SD1) and representative photomicrographs are displayed in [Figure 2](#F2). The most common pattern of injury across all the biopsies was acute hepatitis, sometimes with extensive necrosis, seen in 7 cases. One additional case of diclofenac DILI had prominent zone 3 necrosis without significant inflammation. In contrast, the celecoxib cases showed either cholestatic hepatitis or chronic cholestasis in 3 of the 4 cases, which set them apart from the other NSAIDs and expands the observations reported in the prior study. Autoimmune hepatitis-like injury was noted in 2 of the diclofenac cases and bile duct loss in one of the celecoxib cases. Chronic DILI was mainly associated with cholestatic injury and bile duct loss. Of the 3 subjects with chronic DILI, 2 had a cholestatic injury pattern, including the one with bile duct loss. Two follow-up biopsies were available, one from subject 2 in the prior report. Both showed chronic cholestasis without duct loss.

Representative Histopathologic Findings in DILI due to NSAIDs A, B. Celecoxib injury. A. Portal area with mild inflammation and no visible bile duct (H&E, 400x). B. Canalicular cholestasis (arrow) is present in zone 3. (H&E, 400x). C-E. Diclofenac injury. C. Severe injury with extensive necrosis. Only small nodules of hepatocytes remain. (H&E, 200x). D. The collapse of the parenchyma is seen clearly on a reticulin stain. (Reticulin, 100x). E. Mild diclofenac injury with focal loss of hepatocyte next to the central vein, associated with mild inflammation and pigmented macrophages. (H&E, 400x). F. Naproxen injury. There is severe periportal inflammation with hepatocyte necrosis and ductular reaction. (H&E, 200x). G, H. Ibuprofen injury. G. Portal area with chronic inflammation and eosinophils. (H&E, 400x). H. Eosinophils are seen in the parenchymal inflammation. (H&E, 400x).

### Outcomes of DILI ascribed to NSAIDs

As already shown by the data in [Table 1](#T1), the great majority of patients recovered completely. Nevertheless, there were a few with severe, mainly hepatocellular-type of DILI [R >5] who died within 6 months or required liver transplant. Thus, the disease can occasionally be severe or even fatal or require liver transplantation. It is known for many drugs that those that cause cholestatic-type injury are more likely not to resolve promptly with cessation,^26, 27^ and this was true also for DILI due to NSAIDs. Specifically, 3/5 [60%] with R <2 developed chronic DILI, whereas only 1/7 [14%] with mixed-type injury [R = 2–5] and 5/36 [13.9%] with hepatocellular-type injury [R >5] showed ongoing liver injury at 6 months.

#### Genetic Markers

[Table 3](#T4) summarizes the results from *HLA* alleles association analyses that were performed across and by ethnicities. In the multiethnic cohort, *HLA-DRB1*04:03* was found significantly associated with NSAID-DILI risk, exceeding the multiple testing correction threshold (OR = 8.73; 95%CI [3.95–16.66], p = 8.67×10^−6^, FDR = 0.0005, [Table 3](#T4)). This rare class II risk allele was carried by 13% (n = 7, AF = 0.07) of the 5 NSAID-DILI cases and by only 1% of subjects with DILI due to other prescription drugs. Interestingly, all seven carriers [100%], regardless of their ethnicities, carried the *HLA-DRB1*04:03/HLA-DQA1*03:01* haplotype (p = 3.69×10^−12^ [Supplemental Table 3](#SD1)), and 6 out of 7 (75%) the extended haplotype *HLA-DRB1*04:03/HLA-DQA1*03:01/HLA-DQB1*03:02* (p = 1.81×10^−10^ [Supplemental Table 3](#SD1)). Overall, *HLA-DRB1*04:03* is a consistently rare allele among Non-Hispanic-White (NHW), Non-Hispanic-Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Asian general populations showing an average AF = 0.005. Similarly, NSAID cases consistently showed ten-times higher frequency (AF = 0.06) of *HLA-DRB1*04:03* compared to matched controls in each genetic ancestry group ([Table 3](#T4)). By comparing DILI clinical phenotypes between *HLA-DRB1*04:03* carriers and non-carriers, it was found that *HLA*-*DRB1*04:03* positive status was significantly associated with the severity of the DILI injury [p = 0.006], while the allele was not associated with DRESS [[Supplemental Table 4](#SD1)]. *HLA-A*02:01* was significantly less frequent in NSAID cases compared to controls (OR = 0.40 95%CI [0.20–0.70]; p = 0.0009; FDR= 0.02). *HLA-B*35:03* was also significantly associated with NSAID-DILI risk (OR = 4.69; 95%CI 2.04–9.26; p = 0.0009 FDR = 0.02). The association was mainly driven by NHW and Hispanic NSAID cases. In these two populations, the allele is in fact 10 times more frequent than in NHB [[Table 3](#T4)]. The allele was carried by 13% of the NSAID cases (2 Celecoxib, 2 Diclofenac, 2 Etodolac, 1 Oxaprozin) [[Table 3](#T4)]. Both alleles remained significant after adjusting for *HLA-DRB1*04:03* carriers [[Supplemental Table 5](#SD1)].

Table Caption: Summary statistics of the most associated HLA Alleles with the genetic susceptibility of NSAID-DILI

To investigate the possible role of underlying autoimmune conditions in the *HLA* allele associations, we assessed whether a diagnosis of autoimmune disease was overrepresented among *HLA-DRB1*04:03* regardless of the implicated NSAID. 42% (3 out of 7) of *HLA-DRB1*04:03* carriers reported ‘hypothyroidism’. No other disease was overrepresented (>2 cases) in the two carriers’ cohorts. *HLA-DRB1*04* is associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma and forms of hypothyroidism have been associated with *HLA-DRB1*04:10* but not *HLA-DRB1*04:03*. There were no patients with reported polycystic ovary syndrome or SLE-associated anti-cardiolipin and anti-β2 glycoprotein antibodies, diseases known correlated with *HLA-DRB1*04:03*.^28, 29^

*HLA-DRB1*04:03* belongs to the same allele family as *HLA-DRB1*04:01* allele. *HLA-DRB1*04:01* and *HLA-DRB1*03:01* are known risk factors for autoimmune hepatitis*. HLA-DRB1*04:01* was carried by only one NSAID-DILI case, while *HLA-DRB1*03:01* was not significantly associated [[Supplemental Table 6](#SD1)]. No significant association between NSAID-DILI and *DRB1*04* and *DRB1*03* allele families. [[Supplemental Table 6](#SD1)]. No difference in frequencies of positive ANA or SMA was found between *HLA-DRB1*04:03* carriers and non-carriers [[Supplemental Tables 4](#SD1) and [6](#SD1)].

#### Class-based analysis

We then analyzed 35 cases with DILI ascribed to acetic acid derivatives (AAD) with 85% due to diclofenac, 11% to etodolac, and 2% to sulindac. *HLA-DRB1*04:03* showed a strongly significant association with AAD-DILI, exceeding multiple testing correction (OR = 11.31; 95%CI [4.79–22.76]; p = 6.61×10^−6^; FDR = 0.0002) together with the protective effect of *HLA-A*02:01* [[Table 4](#T5)]. The *HLA-DRB1*04:03* carriers have an almost 12-fold increase in risk to develop DILI after the use of any AAD compared to non-carriers. The finding agrees with the fact that 57% of the *HLA-DRB1*04:03* carriers had DILI attributed to diclofenac, 29% (n=2) etodolac, and only 14% (n=1) to meloxicam [not an AAD], suggesting indeed a possibly specific correlation with the risk of DILI due to AAD instead of the whole NSAID group. *HLA-B*35:03* also passed the significant threshold being carried by 13% cases [[Table 4](#T5)]. Other NSAID drug classes were not analyzed due to low sample size.

| Allele | OR (95%CI) | P | Ctrl AF | AF cases | Carriage Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DRB1*04:03 | 11.31 (4.79,22.76) | 6.61×10−6** | 0.007 | 0.09 | 18% |
| A*02:01 | 0.29 (0.11,0.62) | 0.0008* | 0.23 | 0.07 | 15% |

#### Drug-based analysis

Among causal drugs, diclofenac was the most represented with 29 subjects among whom 59% were of NHW origin. Diclofenac-DILI cases showed a significantly higher carriage rate of *HLA-DRB1*04:03* compared to controls (0.07 vs 0.007, [Supplemental Table 7](#SD1)), and the protective effect of *HLA-A*02:01*. Other causal drugs were not analyzed due to low sample size.

#### Candidate SNP analysis:

rs2476601 is a missense variant in the *PTPN22* gene associated with a general risk of DILI.^16^ NSAID-DILI cases showed a slight enrichment for rs2476601. Hispanic NSAID-DILI patients showed significantly increased frequencies of carrying the *PTPN22* missense variant [[Supplemental Table 8](#SD1)]. None of the *HLA-DRB1*04:03* positive carriers had the A allele for rs2476601.

Additionally, six candidate variants, which were previously suggested to be genetic risk predictors of NSAID/diclofenac DILI, in NHW were studied.^6–8^ The rs1800872 and/or rs1801275 [reported by Aithal et al]^7^ were not present in our dataset nor were rs11572080 and/or rs1058930 (*CYP2C8* variants) [reported by Daly et al.]^8^ No significant association for the other candidate variants in either the multiethnic and NHW NSAID-DILI or the diclofenac-DILI cohorts was observed. Furthermore, CYP2C9*2 and*3 were not associated with the risk of NSAID/diclofenac DILI and were not overrepresented in those carrying *DRB1*04:03* [[Supplemental Table 9](#SD1)].^6^

#### Replication cohort:

We analyzed a validation cohort of 121 NHW NSAID cases and compared them with 10,397 NHW population controls assembled by iSAEC. Clinical information on the DILI phenotype of the 121 NHW NSAID cases is reported in [Supplementary Table 10](#SD1). In the validation cohort, although we found no carriers for the rare *HLA-DRB1*04:03* nor for *HLA-B*57:03*, *HLA-B*35:03* was indeed significantly associated with NSAID DILI (OR = 2.087 95%CI [1.03–4.21] P = 0.04). The allele was carried by 7% of the NSAID cases (5 diclofenac DILI and 1 ibuprofen and 2 nimesulide). The 56 diclofenac cases showed a stronger enrichment for *HLA-B*35:03* (Carriage rate (CR) = 9%, OR = 3.9 95%CI [1.57–9.68] P = 0.003). The protective *HLA-A*02:01* association was not confirmed neither in NSAID nor in diclofenac analysis ([Supplementary Table 11](#SD1)). Among the candidate variants, rs717620, rs10509681, rs1799853, rs1057910 were well-imputed and then tested. Only rs717620 in ABCC2 was marginally associated with the NSAID risk. iSAEC NSAID-DILI patients did show a significantly increased frequency of carrying the *PTPN22* missense variant ([Supplementary Table 11](#SD1)).

## Discussion

This study describes a number of important clinical features and genetic associations of NSAID-DILI. The following points are worthy of emphasis: NSAID-DILI remains infrequent. It mainly impacts women [~ 75% of subjects], and it may be severe or fatal. In our extended series, 7/55 [11%] of subjects, mainly those with acute and severe hepatocellular-type of liver injury, died or required liver transplants within 6 months of DILI onset. Obesity is an apparent risk factor, although it may be that overweight persons are more likely to have arthritis or other painful conditions and more frequently use NSAIDs. Obesity could also be associated with higher daily doses of NSAID use, although NSAID-DILI is idiosyncratic.

In other DILI registries, especially that of the Spanish group, ibuprofen is the NSAID most often implicated, and is commonly implicated in Latin America.^30, 31^ However, in the USA, ibuprofen, despite its wide-spread use by prescription [[Supplemental Table 1](#SD1)] and even more wide-spread use over-the-counter, is a rare cause of idiosyncratic DILI. Perhaps in the future, genetic or environmental factors will be identified to help account for these still unexplained differences. In contrast, diclofenac continues to be the NSAID most often implicated in the DILIN, while ibuprofen accounted for <10% of cases despite widespread use. Although diclofenac was the most common agent in this cohort, when one adjusts for numbers of prescriptions written or millions of users, the risks of DILI ascribed to etodolac [12.27/million] or sulindac [8.77/million] are similar or greater than those ascribed to diclofenac [7.19/million] [[Supplemental Table 1](#SD1)]. Indomethacin, a structurally related AAD NSAID, was not implicated as a cause in the DILIN cohort, perhaps related to its being prescribed and used less frequently and/or to its having a lower risk of causing DILI.

There are typical and differing ‘signatures’ of DILI for different drugs: specifically, drugs that lead to more cholestatic-types of liver injury, namely, celecoxib, meloxicam, or oxaprozin [R values of 2.5, 1.3, and 5.4, respectively], also have shorter latencies [31, 22.5, and 16 days, respectively]. As with other agents that cause cholestatic or mixed type liver injuries,^26, 27^ such drugs tend to produce a prolonged illness, albeit with eventual recovery without chronic DILI. In contrast, diclofenac, the single most common cause of NSAID-DILI in the USA, accounting for over ½ of all cases, causes hepatocellular-type DILI [median R = 15], with longer latency [median 66 d]. Ibuprofen has similar latency with even higher R= 20.5. Etodolac had the longest latency [143 d] with similar high R= 16.5.

The recently described RECAM appears to be promising [[Suppl Figure 1](#SD1)].^13^ In this single agent class analysis, RECAM had a higher agreement with expert opinion than did RUCAM, particularly in ibuprofen cases, albeit without reaching statistical significance in this relatively small cohort. RECAM scores were higher than those of the older RUCAM, especially when there were not missing variables [e.g., HCV RNA or HEV IgM or RNA]. RECAM may therefore have an advantage in adjudicating non-diclofenac NSAID-DILI and in guiding clinicians to appropriate testing to rule out competing etiologies if used in real-time in cases of suspected NSAID DILI. A web-based tool to aid in calculating RECAM scores is available at [http://dilirecam.com](http://dilirecam.com).

This large and well-phenotyped cohort allowed for novel genetic analyses of NSAID-DILI. Although the associations with certain *HLA* types are highly significant, supporting the potential role of the adaptive immune system in pathogenesis, only a minority of patients with NSAID-DILI present with immuno-allergic or auto-immune features, such as fever, rash, DRESS, increased absolute eosinophil counts or other hematological abnormalities [9/54, 17%], positive serum ANA, SMA, or elevated serum immunoglobulins; and all such variables occur with similar frequencies in idiosyncratic DILI ascribed to NSAIDs as to non-NSAID drugs [[Table 1](#T1)].

Highly significant independent risk associations between *HLA-DRB1*04:03* and protective associations with *HLA-A*02:01*, and NSAID-DILI were found [[Table 3](#T4)]. Carriers of *HLA-DRB1*04:03* have 8 times higher risk of developing *NSAID DILI* compared to non-carriers and more severe reactions [[Suppl Table 4](#SD1)]. Regardless of ethnicities, all subjects with the *HLA*-*DRB1*04:03* genotype also carried *HLA-DQA1*03:01* and some the even more extended *HLA* haplotype. The association seems to be consistent across different populations. Diclofenac cases and, more generally, AAD NSAIDs might be the relevant drug class driving the association, because 6 of the 7 carriers belong to this NSAID class. In contrast, *HLA-A*02:01* showed a significant independent protective effect consistent across different populations also likely driven by AAD and diclofenac cases. The *HLA-DRB1*04:03* association was not replicated in an independent NHW cohort of NSAID DILI. The validation confirmed instead an association between *HLA-B*35:03* and NSAID DILI risk. The latter allele belongs to the same HLA family as *HLA-B*35:01*, a known risk factor for DILI due to cotrimoxazole,^16^ *Polygonum multiflorum*, green tea, and *Garcinia cambogia*.^32, 33^ These novel findings extend those of recent studies with several other drugs,^32, 34, 35^ and further support the importance of innate immuno-genetic factors in modulating the risks of developing idiosyncratic DILI. The only modest strength of the genetic associations with selected *HLA* types or extended haplotypes seems insufficient to recommend *HLA* genetic testing prior to prescribing the use of NSAIDs. However, such testing may be helpful in ascribing liver injury to NSAIDs in cases of polypharmacy, in which assignation of specific drug causality, even with RUCAM and/or RECAM, remains difficult.

Subjects with NSAID-DILI had a higher frequency of the *PTPN22* missense variant, recently described as a general idiosyncratic DILI risk factor,^9^ in EA and especially in Hispanic populations among whom the difference from the frequency in controls was highly significant [[Supplemental Table 8](#SD1)]. In contrast, genetic associations of diclofenac-DILI with genetic variants of IL-4, ABCC2, CYPs, or UGT2B7 were not confirmed [[Supplemental Table 9](#SD1)].^6–8^

**Strengths of this work** include the detailed clinical and laboratory data collected at baseline and the extended follow-ups, which are important in order to ascribe causality with greater confidence. Estimated relative risks have been calculated by adjusting DILI incidence to millions of patients and prescriptions for whom the several drugs were prescribed [[Supplemental Table 1](#SD1)]. In addition, for the first time, *HLA* and other genetic analyses have been performed on a sizable number of subjects with well-characterized NSAID-induced DILI.

**Limitations of this work** include the fact that not all or likely even nearly all cases of NSAID-induced DILI that have occurred in the USA since 2003 have been captured. Thus, probably, only the tip of a much larger iceberg, most of which is below the threshold of clinical diagnosis and/or referral to one of the US DILIN clinical sites, is reported. In addition, long-term follow-up information, while unique and comprehensive, was not achieved for all subjects, nor were liver biopsies at baseline or long-term follow-up available for central review on most subjects.

**In conclusion,** idiosyncratic DILI due to NSAIDs continues to occur in the USA, with similar overall observed frequency in 2014–2022 compared to 2004–2013.^5^ The agent most frequently implicated is diclofenac, for which the pattern of injury is usually hepatocellular and is moderate to severe. Ibuprofen and etodolac also cause hepatocellular type of injury, whereas celecoxib [the second most common cause], meloxicam, and oxaprozin cause cholestatic or mixed type injury. These findings may aid clinicians in heeding the risk of DILI when prescribing NSAIDs and recognizing DILI should it develop. The pathogenesis of NSAID-induced DILI, as for most other drugs, appears to be immune-mediated. The over-representation of *HLA DRB*04:03* and *HLA-B*35:03* that is mostly enriched in subjects with AAD-induced DILI, while significant, is too low to make it cost-effective to ascertain *HLA* types prior to starting chronic NSAID use in individual patients. Nonetheless, knowledge of *HLA* types may have clinical applicability in incriminating or exonerating NSAIDs as a cause of liver injury in cases with several possible causative drugs or other confounding factors in causality adjudication.
