## Abstract

**Background:** 
Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is an adverse drug reaction that recurs at the same site upon re-exposure to the triggering medication. Sulfonamide antibiotics, especially sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, are common causes of FDE. Previous studies have linked drug hypersensitivity reactions to specific human leukocyte antigens (HLA).

**Objective:** 
This study aimed to investigate the association between HLA-A and FDE induced by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.

**Methods:** 
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 30 FDE patients and 30 healthy controls who had tolerated sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Blood samples (3 ml) were collected for HLA-A typing using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific oligonucleotides (PCR-SSO).

**Results:** 
Twenty-three HLA-A alleles were detected. In the FDE group, the alleles with high frequency were HLA-A*02:07 (12 patients; 40%), HLA-A*11:01 (10 patients; 33.3%), and HLA-A*24:02 (6 patients; 20%). In the control group, the most commonly observed alleles were HLA-A*11:01 (12 patients; 40%), HLA-A*24:02 (6 patients; 20%), HLA-A*24:07 (6 patients; 20%), HLA-A*29:01 (6 patients; 20%), and HLA-A*33:03 (9 patients; 30%). The FDE group had a higher frequency of HLA-A*02:07 than the control group (40% vs. 16.67%, p < 0.05). No differences in the frequencies of other HLA-A alleles were observed between the two groups. Participants with the HLA-A*02:07 allele were 3.33 times more likely to develop FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim compared to those without the allele (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.09 - 11.14).

**Conclusion:** 
The study suggests an association between the HLA-A*02:07 allele and FDE induced by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the Vietnamese population. Screening for HLA-A*02:07 prior to prescribing sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim could help identify at-risk individuals and prevent FDE.

## 1. BACKGROUND

Fixed drug eruption (FDE) refers to a drug-induced skin or mucosal reaction that typically recurs at the same location when the drug is reintroduced. Acute FDE typically presents as one or a few red or violaceous patches, which resolve spontaneously, leaving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Uncommon atypical variants of FDE include a non-pigmenting form and the generalized bullous form (generalized bullous FDE), which can present with clinical features resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) ([1](#ref1)). These severe forms can lead to complications such as secondary infections, fluid loss, electrolyte imbalance, and other potentially life-threatening conditions. Severe cases of FDE have been reported in up to 22% of patients ([2](#ref2), [3](#ref3)). FDE is a relatively frequent type of drug-induced reaction, representing approximately 14-22% of all drug allergies, making it the second most common type after morbilliform drug eruptions ([2](#ref2)). However, FDE is often underdiagnosed, leading to delayed treatment and counseling, which can result in aesthetics, recurrence, and persistence of symptoms. A study conducted in Pakistan reported that 69% of patients had the condition for at least one year before being diagnosed ([4](#ref4)). Oral medications are the most common cause of FDE, whereas topical and intravaginal drugs are less frequently implicated. Common causes include antimicrobial sulfonamides, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and sedatives ([5](#ref5)–[7](#ref7)).

Studies conducted globally and in Vietnam have shown a correlation between certain types of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions and human leukocyte antigens (HLA). In patients of Chinese descent with SJS/TEN, a strong correlation has been identified between aromatic antiepileptic drugs-including carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine-and the HLA-B*15:02 ([8](#ref8)). Similarly, HLA-B*58:01 has been linked to allopurinol in this population ([9](#ref9),[10](#ref10)). The connection between HLA-B*15:02 and carbamazepine has also been documented in Vietnamese, Thai, Malaysian, and South Indian SJS/TEN patients. However, this association has not been reported in individuals from Japan, Korea, or Europe ([11](#ref11),[12](#ref12)). In European patients, there is a reported link between HLA-B*57:01 and SJS/TEN caused by abacavir ([13](#ref13)) and between HLA-A*31:01 and SJS/TEN due to carbamazepine ([14](#ref14)). Japanese studies have shown that HLA-B*15:11 may predispose individuals to carbamazepine-related SJS/TEN, and HLA-A*02:06 has been associated with acetaminophen-induced SJS/TEN ([15](#ref15)). Screening for high-risk HLA alleles linked to drug hypersensitivity reactions, including fixed drug eruption (FDE), has the potential to reduce adverse reactions to specific medications. To date, no research in Vietnam has examined the association between specific HLA alleles and FDE.

## 2. OBJECTIVE

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A) and fixed drug eruption caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.

## 3. MATERIAL AND METHODS

The research subjects consisted of individuals of the Kinh ethnic group in Vietnam.

Patients diagnosed with FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (based on medication history or/and drug rechallenge testing after the lesions had healed, applied in cases with fewer than three skin lesions and no severe mucosal involvement), who consented to participate in the study, were examined and treated at the National Hospital of Dermatology and Venereology from January to December 2024.

**Diagnostic Criteria for FDE**

For patients who had experienced the condition two or more times, diagnosis relied on a history of drug use, recurrence of symptoms from previous episodes, and typical clinical features: dark red patches, possibly with central blisters, which often left long-lasting post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation upon healing. Lesions varied in number and were found on the skin, extremities, and mucous membranes. They frequently recurred at previous sites or appeared in new locations upon re-exposure to the suspected allergenic drug. For first-time patients, diagnosis primarily depended on clinical features, skin or mucosal lesions, and possibly a history of using drugs suspected of causing FDE.

The control group comprised healthy participants with no history of drug allergies or FDE induced by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. These individuals had received Biseptol (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim) twice, one week apart, without displaying any FDE symptoms within one month after the second dose. Three milliliters of whole blood were collected from each FDE patient and each healthy participant for HLA-A typing, using EDTA-containing tubes as anticoagulants.

**High-Resolution HLA-A Typing Using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO)**

The technique relied on the hybridization principle between the DNA probe and fluorescently labeled DNA fragments derived from the test samples. Each DNA probe was specifically designed to target a unique HLA-A allele with high resolution. Using fluorescence intensity as a reference, the Luminex system identified which probes bound to the DNA sequences in the samples and determined the corresponding HLA-A genotypes. The Lifecodes HLA-SSO kit and Luminex 200 system from Immucor, USA, were used. The testing steps included: a) Amplification using biotinylated primers, b) Hybridization with beads, c) Labeling with Streptavidin-Phycoerythrin (SA-PE), and d) Analysis using a fluorescence-based analyzer.

**Data processing**

The dataset was thoroughly reviewed and cleaned prior to entry. Data management and analysis were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies and percentages to indicate the number of participants positive for each allele. Differences in allele frequencies were assessed using Fisher's exact test or the Chi-square test. Associations between FDE and specific alleles were evaluated through logistic regression, with crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated. Statistical significance was determined with a p-value of less than 0.05.

**Ethics in research**

The study received approval from the ethics committee of the National Hospital of Dermatology and Venereology, as specified in Decision Number 68/HĐĐĐ-BVDLTW, issued on December 21, 2023.

## 4. RESULTS

Among patients with fixed drug eruption (FDE) caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 90% (27 patients) had a history of FDE. The most common onset occurred within 24 hours after drug administration, affecting 56.7% (17 patients). The proportion of patients with mucosal lesions was relatively high, at 66.7% (20 patients). Most patients had two or more lesions, accounting for 96.7% (29 patients). All patients presented with red patches or hyperpigmentation, accompanied by itching or a burning sensation at the lesion sites. Blisters were observed in 30% (9 patients). The lesions were most commonly found on the trunk, upper limbs, and around the mouth. Lesions in the genital area were observed in 8 patients, accounting for 26.7% ([Table 1](#table1)).

A total of 23 HLA-A alleles were detected. Within the FDE group, the most frequently observed alleles were HLA-A*02:07 (12 patients; 40%), HLA-A*11:01 (10 patients; 33.3%), and HLA-A*24:02 (6 patients; 20%). In the control group, the alleles with the highest occurrence were HLA-A*11:01 (12 patients; 40%), HLA-A*24:02 (6 patients; 20%), HLA-A*24:07 (6 patients; 20%), HLA-A*29:01 (6 patients; 20%), and HLA-A*33:03 (9 patients; 30%). The presence of the HLA-A*02:07 allele was more frequent in the FDE group than in the control group (40% vs. 16.67%), with the difference being statistically significant (p < 0.05). The proportions of other alleles did not differ between the two groups ([Table 3](#table3)).

HLA-A*0207 allele was marginally associated with FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (p-value = 0.050). Compared to those without HLA-A*0207, participants with HLA-A*0207 allele were at a higher risk of experiencing FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim by 3.33 times, OR (95% CI) = 3.33 (1.09 - 11.14) ([Table 4](#table4)).

## 5. DISCUSSION

**Characteristics of FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim**

Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is a commonly prescribed antibiotic belonging to the sulfonamide group and is widely used due to its broad-spectrum efficacy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. It has been frequently prescribed for the treatment of various common infections, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract infections. Available in oral form and reasonably priced, it is easily accessible to patients. However, it has been associated with several adverse reactions, such as rash, urticaria, fever, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and, in rare cases, anaphylactic shock. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim has also been identified as a major cause of FDE ([16](#ref16)). In our study, 30 patients with FDE induced by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were included. Of these, 90% had a history of FDE, and 60% experienced two or more recurrences. In Vietnam, the lack of strict drug regulations has allowed individuals to easily obtain medications from private pharmacies. As a result, many patients with a history of FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim remain unaware of their condition and continue to use the drug.

Lesions were predominantly distributed around the mouth, trunk, and upper limbs, with most patients presenting multiple skin lesions (96.7%). The proportion of patients with mucosal lesions was high (66.7%), and 26.7% had genital lesions. A study by Thankappan on 158 FDE patients in India reported that sulfonamides, including Cotrimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim), frequently caused lesions on the lips (91%) as well as the trunk and limbs (89%) ([17](#ref17)). Similarly, Sharma’s research showed that FDE lesions caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim commonly involved the mucosa of the lips and genital area ([18](#ref18)). Another study by Nnoruka EN also observed that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim often caused lesions in the genital area and on the lips, with 48% of male patients presenting lesions on the penile foreskin ([19](#ref19)). The presence of the drug in the urethra is believed to contribute to genital lesions.

**The association between HLA-A and FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.**

The results revealed that HLA-A alleles were highly diverse, with each individual possessing two different alleles located on two branches of chromosome ([6](#ref6)), the majority of which were heterozygous. The frequency of the HLA-A02:07 allele was significantly higher in the FDE group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the distribution of other alleles between the two groups. A significant association was found between the HLA-A02:07 allele and FDE induced by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (p = 0.050). Participants carrying the HLA-A*02:07 allele were 3.33 times more likely to develop FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim compared to those without the allele (OR = 3.33; 95% CI: 1.09 - 11.14; p = 0.043).

As far as we are aware, this study was the first in Vietnam to identify the association between the HLA-A02:07 allele and FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Globally, few studies have explored the association between HLA alleles and FDE induced by specific drugs. In 1994, Pellicano conducted a study in Italy involving 36 unrelated FDE patients, in which HLA class I and II alleles were typed using T-lymphocytotoxicity. The results indicated that the frequencies of HLA-B*22 and Cw1 were significantly higher among these patients compared to the control group (p < 0.0001) ([20](#ref20)). Among 28 FDE cases related to feprazone, 26 were positive for HLA-B*22, whereas only 12 FDE cases induced by other drugs were negative for HLA-B*22 allele ([21](#ref21)). In a study by Ozkaya-Bayazit in Turkey, involving 67 FDE patients, 42 patients with FDE induced by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole exhibited significantly higher frequencies of the HLA-A30 antigen and the HLA-A30 B13 Cw6 haplotype compared to controls (p < 0.001) ([22](#ref22)). Additionally, FDE induced by allopurinol was observed in a Han Chinese patient who was negative for HLA-B*58:01 ([23](#ref23)).

According to the study by Hoa BK et al. on 170 Kinh individuals, the majority ethnic group in Vietnam, 21 distinct HLA-A alleles were detected. The most prevalent alleles included HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02, and HLA-A*33:03, with HLA-B*15:02 being the most frequently observed HLA-B alleles at 13.5% ([24](#ref24)). In our study, there were 23 HLA-A alleles found. In the FDE group, the alleles with high frequencies were HLA-A*02:07, HLA-A*11:01, and HLA-A*24:02. Within the control group, the most frequent alleles were HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-A*24:07, HLA-A*29:01, and HLA-A*33:03 (30%). Thus, these findings closely align with those of Hoa BK et al., particularly regarding the distribution of common HLA-A alleles in the Vietnamese population.

This study had several limitations, including a small sample size (30 individuals per group) and a focus solely on HLA-A analysis. Nevertheless, it provided initial evidence of an association between HLA-A and FDE in the Vietnamese population. Individuals carrying the HLA-A*02:07 allele were 3.33 times more likely to develop FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim compared to those without the allele. Clinically, it is recommended to screen for the HLA-A*02:07 allele before prescribing sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim to mitigate the risk of FDE. Future research should involve larger sample sizes and more comprehensive analyses of various HLA classes to better assess the relationship between HLA alleles and drugs causing FDE.

## 6. CONCLUSION

The HLA-A*02:07 allele was found to be associated with FDE caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Individuals carrying the HLA-A*02:07 allele were 3.33 times more likely to develop FDE from sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim compared to those without the allele.
