## Abstract

**BACKGROUND:** 
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene leading to progressive respiratory decline. Some CFTR mutations exhibit residual function and respond to the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in vitro, whereas ivacaftor alone does not restore activity to Phe508del.

**METHODS:** 
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3, crossover study to evaluate efficacy and safety of ivacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor, a CFTR corrector, in 248 patients ≥12 years with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del and a CFTR mutation associated with residual CFTR function. Patients were randomized to one of six sequences, each with two 8-week treatment periods separated by an 8-week washout. They received tezacaftor-ivacaftor, ivacaftor monotherapy, or placebo. The primary endpoint was absolute change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline.

**RESULTS:** 
Individual treatment periods included tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=162), ivacaftor monotherapy (n=157), or placebo (n=162). Groups were well balanced at baseline. Significant treatment effects were observed in percentage of predicted FEV1 for tezacaftor-ivacaftor (6.8 percentage points, P<0.001) and ivacaftor (4.7 percentage points, P<0.001) versus placebo. Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, a quality of life measure, also significantly improved. Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with no treatment discontinuations due to adverse events for tezacaftor-ivacaftor, and few for ivacaftor (1.3%) and placebo (0.6%).

**CONCLUSIONS:** 
CFTR modulator therapy with tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor are highly efficacious for patients with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del and a CFTR residual function mutation (Funded by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated; EXPAND ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02392234).

### BACKGROUND

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene leading to progressive respiratory decline. Some CFTR mutations exhibit residual function and respond to the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in vitro, whereas ivacaftor alone does not restore activity to Phe508del.

### METHODS

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3, crossover study to evaluate efficacy and safety of ivacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor, a CFTR corrector, in 248 patients ≥12 years with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del and a *CFTR* mutation associated with residual CFTR function. Patients were randomized to one of six sequences, each with two 8-week treatment periods separated by an 8-week washout. They received tezacaftor-ivacaftor, ivacaftor monotherapy, or placebo. The primary endpoint was absolute change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV_1_) from baseline.

### RESULTS

Individual treatment periods included tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=162), ivacaftor monotherapy (n=157), or placebo (n=162). Groups were well balanced at baseline. Significant treatment effects were observed in percentage of predicted FEV_1_ for tezacaftor-ivacaftor (6.8 percentage points, P<0.001) and ivacaftor (4.7 percentage points, P<0.001) versus placebo. Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, a quality of life measure, also significantly improved. Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with no treatment discontinuations due to adverse events for tezacaftor-ivacaftor, and few for ivacaftor (1.3%) and placebo (0.6%).

### CONCLUSIONS

CFTR modulator therapy with tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor are highly efficacious for patients with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del and a *CFTR* residual function mutation (Funded by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated; EXPAND [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov) number, [NCT02392234](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02392234)).

## INTRODUCTION

Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, systemic, life-limiting, autosomal recessive disease that is caused by reduced quantity and/or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein due to mutations in the *CFTR* gene.^1,2^ Loss of chloride transport activity due to defects in CFTR results in the accumulation of inspissated mucus in the airways, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration.^1,2^

More than 270 *CFTR* mutations are known to cause cystic fibrosis.^3^ Disease severity and rate of disease progression vary with mutation, and are determined in part by the extent of chloride transport loss associated with each. A substantial minority of *CFTR* mutations, affecting approximately 5% of the overall population with cystic fibrosis, exhibits residual CFTR ion transport due to partially retained CFTR expression and variably preserved channel gating and/or function.^4–6^ These ‘residual function’ mutations cause cystic fibrosis with lung disease and a markedly reduced life expectancy, but the disease generally progresses more slowly than more common forms of cystic fibrosis.^7^ Without the use of newborn screening, patients with cystic fibrosis caused by these mutations are often diagnosed beyond early infancy, and are more likely to be pancreatic sufficient and have sweat chloride values below 90 mmol/L, indicating partially preserved *CFTR* activity.^4,8,9^ In contrast, the common Phe508del *CFTR* mutation, which results in cellular degradation of the protein and causes severe dysfunction, when homozygous, leads to early onset cystic fibrosis and more rapid disease progression.^7^

Two complementary types of drugs have been developed with different mechanisms of action to increase CFTR-mediated anion secretion.^10^ CFTR potentiators like ivacaftor increase the channel gating of CFTR at the cell surface to enhance ion transport and are highly efficacious in treating gating mutations.^11–13^ CFTR correctors modify the cellular processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to increase the amount of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Ivacaftor-responsive CFTR mutations were identified based on a clinical phenotype of residual CFTR function (which indicates the presence of functional CFTR protein on the cell surface), in vitro data and clinical case reports.^14,15^ The addition of the CFTR corrector, tezacaftor, was hypothesized to enhance clinical benefit in these mutations by increasing overall CFTR function; this combination treatment is particularly important for restoring activity to Phe508del-*CFTR*, as shown for the approved corrector-potentiator combination lumacaftor-ivacaftor.^6,16–19^

Tezacaftor (VX-661) is an investigational CFTR corrector that, in combination with ivacaftor, has been shown to improve lung function and sweat chloride in a phase 2 clinical trial in patients homozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* and in patients heterozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* and *G551D*.^20^ We hypothesized that this combination would also be beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis caused by Phe508del-*CFTR* and a residual function mutation.

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial (VX14-661-108) evaluated the efficacy and safety of tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy and ivacaftor monotherapy in patients aged 12 years or older with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* and a residual function-*CFTR* mutation.

## METHODS

### Study Design

This trial was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 3-treatment, crossover, multicenter study (VX14-661-108; [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov) [NCT02392234](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02392234)) conducted in patients aged 12 years or older with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* and a second allele with a *CFTR* mutation with residual function, at 86 study sites in Australia, Europe, Israel, and North America from March 27, 2015 to February 16, 2017. These mutations, listed in [Table S1](#SD1) in the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1), were identified by in vitro response to ivacaftor and population-level clinical phenotype from epidemiologic data or published literature.^3^ This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of (1) tezacaftor (VX-661, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Boston, MA, United States) in combination with ivacaftor (VX-770, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Boston, MA, United States) and (2) ivacaftor monotherapy in this patient population using an incomplete block design.

Each patient received two of the following three treatment regimens: tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy (tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours); ivacaftor monotherapy (ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours); or placebo. This trial included a screening period, two treatment periods of 8 weeks separated by a washout period of 8 weeks, and a safety follow-up visit. Patients were enrolled and stratified by age at screening (aged <18 vs. ≥18 years), FEV_1_ severity at the screening visit (<70 vs. ≥70 percentage of predicted), and type of residual function mutation (class V noncanonical splice or class II-IV residual function (missense) mutations; [Table S1](#SD1) in [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)), and then randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of six treatment sequences as shown in [Fig. S1](#SD1) in the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1).

Eligible patients who completed the week 24 visit at the end of the second treatment period were offered the opportunity to enroll in an extension study ([NCT02565914](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02565914)). The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee at each of the study sites before study initiation, and all enrolled patients, and their parent/legal guardian (if applicable), provided written informed consent.

The study sponsor (Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) designed the protocol in collaboration with the authors. Local site investigators collected the data, which were analyzed by the sponsor. All authors had full access to study data after the study ended and data were unblinded. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the alignment of this report to the study protocols.

### Study Participants

Patients aged 12 years or older who were confirmed at the screening visit to be heterozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* and a second allele with a residual function *CFTR* mutation ([Table S1](#SD1)) were eligible for inclusion if they had a percentage of predicted FEV_1_ ≥40 and ≤90 at screening, stable lung disease, and a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L. If the sweat chloride value was <60 mmol/L, there must have been documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease (see [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)).

Patients were excluded if they had clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at screening (hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL, abnormal liver or renal function); acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy for pulmonary disease within 28 days before day 1 (first dose of study drug) of the trial; a history of solid organ or hematological transplantation; recent participation in an investigational drug study or use of a commercially available CFTR modulator; or a history of any comorbidity that might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk.

### Study Assessments

The primary endpoint was absolute change in percentage of predicted FEV_1_ from study baseline to the average of the week 4 and week 8 measurements in each treatment period. The key secondary endpoint was absolute change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score from study baseline to the average of the week 4 and week 8 measurements in each treatment period. Safety and tolerability were assessed as a secondary objective based on adverse events, clinical laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, pulse oximetry, and spirometry. Additional secondary endpoints included relative change in percentage of predicted FEV_1_ and absolute change in sweat chloride (a measure of CFTR function), all from study baseline to the average of the week 4 and week 8 measurements in each treatment period. Exploratory and additional supportive endpoints are noted in the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1).

### Statistical Analyses

The primary efficacy analysis, evaluation of the absolute change from study baseline in percentage of predicted FEV_1_ to the average of the week 4 and week 8 measurements in (1) tezacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo and (2) ivacaftor monotherapy and placebo arms, was based on a mixed-effects model. The fixed effects in the model were: treatment, period and percentage of predicted FEV_1_ at study baseline, with patient as a random effect. Statistical analyses of all secondary endpoints were similar to that of the analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint (defined further in the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)). The type I error rate for treatment comparisons versus placebo for the primary and key secondary endpoint was controlled by prespecifying a gatekeeping approach. All safety analyses included patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug and were based on data associated with each treatment-emergent period, which extended from the first dose of study drug in the period to 28 days after the last dose in the same period. The proposed sample size yielded approximately 90% power to observe a statistically significant difference between tezacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo for the primary endpoint. No carryover effect was seen between treatment period 1 and 2, hence each treatment period was evaluated independently.

## RESULTS

### Participants

A total of 248 patients were enrolled and randomized. One patient assigned to placebo and one patient assigned to ivacaftor in period 1 were later deemed to be screen failures and did not receive treatment. Of the remaining 246 patients, 234 (95.1%) completed both treatment periods resulting in 481 evaluable patient periods ([Fig. S2](#SD1) in the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)). Baseline characteristics and patient demographics for patients in period 1 were similar among all groups ([Table 1](#T1)), with an overall mean (SD) percentage of predicted FEV_1_ of 62.3% (14.5). Patient demographics and baseline characteristics in period 2 were similar to those for period 1 (data not shown).

### Clinical Efficacy

Treatment with tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint, absolute change in percentage of predicted FEV_1_ compared with placebo. The least squares (LS) mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) treatment difference versus placebo from study baseline to the average of week 4 and week 8 was 6.8 (5.7, 7.8) percentage points (P<0.001) for tezacaftor-ivacaftor and 4.7 (3.7, 5.8) percentage points (P<0.001) for ivacaftor ([Table 2](#T2)). The treatment difference between tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor was statistically significant in favor of tezacaftor-ivacaftor (P<0.001, [Table 2](#T2)).

FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 second.

Both tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor were associated with statistically significant improvements compared with placebo in the key secondary endpoint, absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score. The LS mean (95% CI) change from study baseline to the average of week 4 and week 8 was 11.1 (8.7, 13.6) points for tezacaftor-ivacaftor and 9.7 (7.2, 12.2) points for ivacaftor compared with placebo (P <0.001 for both treatment groups; [Table 2](#T2)). The percentage of patients who achieved the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points or greater was 65.2% in the tezacaftor-ivacaftor group, 58.3% in the ivacaftor group, and 32.9% for placebo.^21^

Improvements were observed in both active treatment groups versus placebo for other secondary endpoints ([Table 2](#T2)). Results for relative change in percentage of predicted FEV_1_ were consistent with the findings from the primary analysis. Sweat chloride concentrations were reduced (denoting improved CFTR function) in patients receiving tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor compared with those on placebo (LS mean [95% CI]: tezacaftor-ivacaftor, −9.5 mmol/L [−11.7, −7.3]; and ivacaftor, −4.5 mmol/L [−6.7, −2.3]) achieving a mean [SD] of −59.4 mmol/L [29.2] in the tezacaftor-ivacaftor group ([Table 2](#T2)).

Improvements with both tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy and ivacaftor monotherapy were seen in some exploratory and additional, prespecified endpoints. These included decreases in immunoreactive trypsinogen, a marker of pancreatic function, and reductions in pulmonary exacerbations as compared to placebo that did not reach the level of statistical significance ([Table 2](#T2); [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)). BMI was also assessed and showed increases in both treatment groups and placebo at week 8 (tezacaftor-ivacaftor, 0.47 kg/m^2^; ivacaftor 0.47 kg/m^2^; placebo, 0.18 kg/m^2^), however treatment effects were not statistically significance.

### Safety

There were no deaths in the study. The incidence of adverse events was similar for all three treatment groups. The majority of patients had adverse events that were considered either mild or moderate in severity. Four (2.5%) patients in the tezacaftor-ivacaftor group, 8 (5.1%) patients in the ivacaftor group, and 9 (5.6%) patients in the placebo group had grade 3 (severe) or grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events ([Table 3](#T3)). Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation for zero patients in the tezacaftor-ivacaftor group, two (1.3%) patients in the ivacaftor group, and one (0.6%) patient in the placebo group ([Table 3](#T3); [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)).

Table 3 Caption: Overview of Adverse Events, Safety Set.

Overall, the most common adverse events were typical of the clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis. The most common (≥10% incidence with any treatment) by preferred term, were cough, infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, headache, and hemoptysis. Adverse events with both an incidence of at least 5% and were 1% higher (or two more patients) in the tezacaftor-ivacaftor group compared with placebo, comprised increased sputum, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and headache; for ivacaftor compared with placebo, events comprised increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and hemoptysis ([Table 3](#T3)). With the exception of elevated creatine phosphokinase, none of these were considered serious by the treating investigator. There were no clinically meaningful adverse trends in alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin ([Table S4](#SD1), [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)).

Adverse events associated with respiratory events or respiratory symptoms were less common in the tezacaftor-ivacaftor group than placebo ([Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)). Importantly, there was no evidence of acute bronchoconstriction or FEV_1_ decrease within 2 to 4 hours after tezacaftor-ivacaftor or ivacaftor administration ([Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)), a finding distinct from lumacaftor-based regimens.

## DISCUSSION

This is the first phase 3 trial of combined CFTR corrector-potentiator treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity. Using a crossover design, this study was able to evaluate two distinct concepts: the effect of the potentiator ivacaftor on residual function CFTR protein defects and the benefit of adding the investigational CFTR corrector tezacaftor. Tezacaftor is a broad-acting CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of normal CFTR and multiple mutant CFTR forms, including Phe508del, thereby increasing the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride transport. Results demonstrated important clinical benefit for both combination tezacaftor-ivacaftor treatment as well as ivacaftor treatment alone. These findings confirm the benefits of potentiator therapy in patients with residual CFTR function mutations, and the added benefit conferred by corrector-potentiator combination therapy in this population.

The benefit on spirometry of tezacaftor-ivacaftor, and to a lesser extent, of ivacaftor alone, was substantial. Treatment differences were rapid in onset and sustained at all study visits, similar to those of other trials with highly effective CFTR modulators.^12,14,17,23–25^ Furthermore, treatment differences were consistent across all prespecified subgroup analyses.

Clear and statistically significant improvements in the cystic fibrosis-specific quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure CFQ-R in both the tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor treatment groups were observed indicating clinically significant benefits on overall cystic fibrosis health.^21^ The mean change with treatment exceeded the known MCID, which is tightly linked to the expected benefits of treatment.^26^

Although an effect on pulmonary exacerbations and BMI was not expected in this population treated over only 8 weeks, numeric improvements in both were observed. The findings related to immunoreactive trypsinogen and fecal elastase-1, while exploratory, raise the possibility that CFTR modulation with tezacaftor-ivacaftor may have the potential to improve or preserve pancreatic function in some patients with residual function.

Overall, tezacaftor-ivacaftor treatment was safe and well tolerated, with no treatment discontinuations and no new risks attributable to the combination, and ivacaftor alone recapitulated its well-established safety profile.^24,25^ Tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy was specifically not associated with respiratory adverse events or acute, transient reductions in FEV_1_ as has previously been reported with CFTR modulator therapy with lumacaftor.^13,17^ This represents a potential advantage of tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy in patients with lower baseline lung function or a component of reactive airway disease.

One of the significant challenges in investigating new therapies for residual function mutations is the relative rarity of these genotypes; hence they were treated as a single group due to their common epidemiological characteristics, physiological properties, and the propensity to respond to ivacaftor alone.^3,27^ The data with ivacaftor monotherapy validate previous clinical case reports in a more controlled setting.^14,15^

Sweat chloride levels, a biomarker of CFTR modulation, improved in both active treatment groups, consistent with the mechanism of action of CFTR modulation. The magnitude of sweat chloride change observed with ivacaftor in this study was less than that in patients with gating mutations such as G551D, even though robust lung function and CFQ-R changes were demonstrated in the present study.^12,15,28^ One possible cause for this difference could be that baseline sweat chloride is lower in patients with residual function than in gating patients. This equates to a smaller dynamic range over which improvement can occur.^29,30^ A second cause may be the inherent differential responsiveness of gating mutations and residual function mutations to CFTR potentiation. The varied cellular defects (processing/trafficking, gating, and/or conductance) associated with residual function would be expected to show smaller relative improvements in CFTR function with ivacaftor compared with gating defects, since the principle effect of a potentiator is to restore or augment channel gating.

Findings from the study presented here (VX-661–108) demonstrate safety and efficacy of tezacaftor-ivacaftor and ivacaftor treatment and the efficacy of tezacaftor-ivacaftor over ivacaftor in a patient population with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* and a second mutation resulting in CFTR residual function. These results clearly indicate that highly effective CFTR modulator therapy can be beneficial in this group of patients. A companion trial published in this volume reports that patients homozygous for Phe508del-*CFTR* (VX-661–106) also benefit from tezacaftor-ivacaftor therapy. Collectively, these data underscore the benefit of tezacaftor-ivacaftor treatment in a broad population of patients with cystic fibrosis.
