## Abstract

The aim of this observational study was to investigate the effects of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and ATP-binding cassette transporter B1 (ABCB1) gene polymorphisms on the postoperative analgesic effect of sufentanil in Chinese Han pediatric patients with fractures. A total of 185 pediatric patients who underwent fracture surgery were included. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to detect the polymorphisms of COMT and ABCB1 genes. Sufentanil was used for postoperative analgesia. The pain level of the patients was evaluated using the face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability scale before surgery, during awakening, at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. The postoperative Ramsay sedation score, sufentanil consumption, and incidence of adverse reactions were also recorded. Pediatric patients with different genotypes of ABCB1 and COMT showed no statistically significant differences in general data such as age, gender, weight, height, surgical duration, and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (P > .05). There were no statistically significant differences in sedation scores after surgery between different genotypes of ABCB1 and COMT (P > .05). Among patients with CC genotype in ABCB1, the pain scores and total consumption of sufentanil at awakening, 2 and 6 hours after surgery were higher compared to TT and CT genotypes (P < .05), while there were no statistically significant differences between TT and CT genotypes (P > .05). Among patients with AA genotype in COMT, the pain scores and total consumption of sufentanil at awakening, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery were higher compared to AG and GG genotypes (P < .05), while there were no statistically significant differences between AG and GG genotypes (P > .05). There were no statistically significant differences in adverse reactions between different genotypes of ABCB1 and COMT (P > .05). The polymorphisms of COMT gene rs4680 and ABCB1 gene rs1045642 are associated with the analgesic effect and consumption of sufentanil in pediatric patients after fracture surgery.

## 1. Introduction

Management of acute postoperative pain in pediatric patients is a key focus for pediatric anesthesiologists. The differences between pediatric and adult pain lie in the lower pain threshold, stronger pain responses, more significant physiological changes, prolonged effects, and specific considerations for drug therapy.^[1]^ Currently, opioid medications remain the most commonly used postoperative analgesics in pediatric patients. However, the use of opioid analgesics in the pediatric perioperative period is hindered by significant interindividual differences and a higher incidence of side effects. Multiple studies have suggested that these challenges are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to ion channels, neurotransmitters, Opiate Receptor Mu1 (OPRM1), and cytochrome P450 (CYP).^[2–4]^ Genetic polymorphisms contribute to interindividual differences in pain control and postoperative complications related to analgesic medications, primarily due to the complexity and unpredictability of processes such as gene sequence replication, transcription, and translation. SNP refers to DNA sequence polymorphisms caused by single nucleotide variations at the genomic level and is the most common type of inheritable variation observed in humans. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), widely expressed in the human body, plays a crucial role in regulating pain-related sympathetic nerve tension, emotions, and inflammation by modulating the metabolism of catecholamines.^[5]^ ATP-binding cassette transporter B1 (ABCB1) transports various opioid analgesics across the blood–brain barrier.^[6,7]^ Previous studies have demonstrated the association between SNPs in the COMT and ABCB1 genes and interindividual differences in pain perception and response to analgesics,^[8–10]^ with a focus on chronic pain and adult patients, while research on the relationship between these gene SNPs and acute postoperative pain in pediatric patients is limited. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the correlation between SNPs in the COMT and ABCB1 genes and individual differences in postoperative analgesia with sufentanil in children with fractures, providing a theoretical basis for individualized analgesic therapy in pediatric patients.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Patients

This prospective observational study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Children’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Ethics No. 202211215-1) and informed consent was obtained from the patients’ parents or guardians, with a trial registration number of ChiCTR2300070098. Chinese Han pediatric patients who underwent fracture surgery at our hospital between January 2022 and October 2023 were included in this study, regardless of gender. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age between 1 and 12 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I–II, undergoing open reduction and internal fixation surgery for upper limb fractures, and postoperative use of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Exclusion criteria were as follows: a history of chronic pain before surgery, long-term medication history, allergy to opioid drugs, severe cardiovascular or pulmonary impairment, severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, developmental delay, or mental illness.

### 2.2. Strategy for anesthesia and analgesia

The child was given intravenous access in the ward and routine electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after entering the operating room. Propofol 2 mg/kg and sufentanil 0.3 µg/kg were intravenously injected for anesthesia induction, and the laryngeal mask was placed. Spontaneous breathing was maintained during the operation. After anesthesia induction, 4–5 mL venous blood was collected and placed in a purple EDTA anticoagulant tube for genetic testing. Inhalation of 3% sevoflurane was used for anesthesia maintenance during surgery. At the end of skin closure, PCA intravenous pump was connected: sufentanil citrate injection (Yichang Renfu, 1 mL, 50 µg) 2 µg/kg + dolasetron injection 0.35 mg/kg (Yichang Renfu, 1 mL, 12.5 mg) + 0.9% normal saline diluted to 100 mL, with a background infusion rate of 2 mL/h and PCA dose of 2 mL per administration, with a lockout time of 15 minutes. After the child was sent back to the ward, the anesthesiologist provided guidance on the use of the intravenous PCA pump to the child and family members. If pain persisted (pain score ≥ 5), sufentanil 0.1 µg/kg was administered for rescue analgesia, with repeat dosing allowed every 15 minutes.

### 2.3. Observation indicators

Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale were used to assess pain levels in pediatric patients before surgery, at postoperative awakening, and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Postoperative sufentanil consumption in pediatric patients was observed. The level of sedation in pediatric patients after wake-up was assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale. The incidence of adverse events such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and itching after surgery in pediatric patients was observed.

### 2.4. Selection of candidate genes and detection of gene polymorphisms

Based on previous studies, 6 SNPs of the COMT and ABCB1 genes were selected for investigation: rs740603, rs165722, rs4680, rs1045642, rs1128503, and rs2032582. After collecting blood specimens from patients, they were immediately stored in a refrigerator at 4°C and promptly tested. The specimens were extracted using a blood DNA extraction kit to obtain genomic DNA. One microliter of the extracted DNA was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The amplification reaction system was then treated with a heat-sensitive alkaline phosphatase, followed by the addition of probes and dNTPs to the reaction system. The target sequence amplified by PCR was used as a template for single nucleotide extension. After desalting the extension products, mass spectrometry was performed to analyze the different genotypes of the COMT and ABCB1 genes.

### 2.5. Statistical analysis

Based on the results of preliminary experiments, the overall mean difference and standard deviation of postoperative pain scores between COMT and ABCB1 genotypes were 0.2 and 0.458, respectively. The significance level α was set at 0.05 and the power of the test 1-β was set at 0.8, yielding a calculated sample size of 165. Taking possible attrition rates into account, a total sample size of 185 was determined for this study. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago). Normally distributed continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD), and between-group comparisons were conducted using one-way analysis of variance. Within-group comparisons were made using the LSD method and repeated measures data analysis, as appropriate. Count data were expressed as examples and percentages (%), and between-group comparisons were conducted using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests. The chi-square test was used to test whether allele and genotype distributions were in accordance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. A *P* value of lower than .05 was considered statistically significant.

## 3. Results

A total of 185 pediatric patients were included in this study. Through genetic testing, it was found that only the different genotypes in rs4680 of COMT and rs1045642 of ABCB1 were correlated with postoperative pain scores in the patients. Furthermore, the distribution of wild-type homozygotes (CC/GG), heterozygotes (CT/AG), and mutant type homozygotes (TT/AA) in both gene groups conformed to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium law (Table [1](#T1)), indicating representativeness of the population.

## 4. Discussion

Sufentanil is the most widely used postoperative analgesic in children. It is an opioid receptor agonist^[11,12]^ and exerts its analgesic effect mainly by stimulating µ receptors in pain transmission areas such as the spinal cord, medulla, and midbrain. It has a good analgesic effect. However, the effective analgesic blood concentration of sufentanil can vary more than 50-fold between individuals, which poses challenges to individualized clinical drug use. After injection, sufentanil is primarily metabolized in the liver by the CYP3A4, with metabolites excreted by the kidneys. Additionally, the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein as the most well-known of the ABC transporters plays a critical role in the transmembrane transport of sufentanil and its entry into the central nervous system. COMT serves as a crucial modulator of the catecholamine concentration in the pain perception pathway, leading to the consumption of enkephalins in the brain and an upregulation of opioid receptors, thus influencing the analgesic effects of sufentanil. With the development of genomics, an increasing number of studies have found that genetic factors may play an important role in individual differences in the pharmacokinetics (drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins) or pharmacodynamics (receptors and signal transduction) of opioid drugs.^[2–4]^ Variants of multiple genes including COMT, OPRM1, potassium channel genes, sodium channel genes, CYP3A4, etc, have been implicated. however, research has been mainly focused on chronic pain and adult patients, with scarce studies on the association between sufentanil and acute postoperative pain in bone trauma, especially in children. In this study, by investigating the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of key enzymes and membrane transport proteins involved in the metabolism and tissue distribution of opioid drugs and the analgesic effect of sufentanil in pediatric patients with fractures, it was found that the genetic polymorphisms of ABCB1 and COMT may be important factors causing individual differences in postoperative pain scores and sufentanil consumption in pediatric patients with fractures. Therefore, further exploration of individualized drug use of opioid analgesics can provide theoretical basis for clinical drug use by evaluating genetic polymorphisms or expression targets.

P-glycoprotein encoded by the ABCB1 gene is an important drug transporter protein that depends on energy to export substances from the inside of cells to the outside. It is located in various organs and the blood–brain barrier, and it can affect the uptake of opioid drugs into the brain.^[13]^ The polymorphism of the ABCB1 gene may have an impact on the expression level and function of P-glycoprotein, and thus significantly affect the clinical efficacy and safety of opioid drugs. The ABCB1 gene has multiple polymorphic sites, among which rs1045642 C>T (G>A) or Ile1145Ile is possibly the most well-known SNP site in ABCB1, which is highly correlated with pain and the demand for analgesic drugs. Several studies in adults have found that colorectal cancer patients with the ABCB1 gene rs1045642 TT genotype have lower postoperative pain scores and fentanyl consumption after abdominal colorectal anastomosis.^[14]^ Candiotti et al^[15]^ also found that the pain scores of CC genotype patients were the highest, followed by the CT group, and the pain scores of the TT genotype were the lowest in their analysis of pain scores in renal resection patients 24 hours after surgery. In Gong et al^[8]^ study, no significant differences were found in the 24-hour opioid drug doses among cancer pain patients carrying different ABCB1 gene phenotypes. However, when measuring the adjusted 24-hour opioid drug doses based on body surface area, TT patients often required significantly lower opioid substance intake than CC/CT carriers. In South Indian patients undergoing major breast surgery, carriers of ABCB1 mutation genes had lower postoperative pain scores.^[9]^ Our study analyzed postoperative pain in pediatric fracture patients and found similar results to previous studies in adults. We found that patients with mutation genes (TT/CT) had decreased pain scores in the first 12 hours after surgery, as well as reduced sufentanil consumption, suggesting that mutated patients are less sensitive to postoperative pain and have reduced analgesic requirements after surgery. This finding is consistent with some previous studies in children: children with the ABCB1 CC genotype experience more postoperative pain after orthopedic or abdominal surgery,^[16]^ critically ill children with the A allele of ABCB1 require less fentanyl,^[17]^ and African American children with the A allele require less morphine after tonsillectomy.^[18]^ The reason for this may be related to decreased expression or activity of P-glycoprotein caused by the rs1045642 C>T in ABCB1. Although rs1045642 C>T is a synonymous mutation that keeps the amino acid sequence unchanged, synonymous codon substitutions can affect the mRNA coding sequence and encoding efficiency. In addition, synonymous mRNA mutations can also alter protein folding mechanisms in the body, affecting the function of molecular chaperones in the protein dynamic balance network.^[19]^ All of these can ultimately affect the expression or activity of P-glycoprotein. Children with mutated gene types may have higher concentrations of analgesic drugs in their cerebrospinal fluid and require smaller doses of drugs to control pain.^[20]^ Therefore, ABCB1 polymorphism may be an important genetic predictor for guiding the treatment of acute pain after pediatric fracture surgery. However, some studies have found no analgesic dose effect of this SNP in European Caucasian American children and Korean children,^[21]^ so the relationship between ABCB1 rs1045642 SNP and pediatric pain may vary among different populations, and more research is needed to further validate this relationship.

The COMT gene encodes the COMT protein. The COMT protein is an enzyme that metabolizes various catecholamine neurotransmitters, such as adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine, which have various functions in the brain, including pain regulation and processing. Theoretically, SNPs of the COMT gene may affect the stability of mRNA, thereby affecting the expression and enzymatic activity of the COMT protein, and being related to individual differences in pain sensitivity and response to opioid analgesics. However, the research results on this issue are inconsistent. An Indian study showed that the G–A conversion of the COMT gene represents a functional genetic polymorphism (Val158Met), which reduces enzymatic activity and is associated with chronic pain after sternotomy.^[10]^ However, a study in the United States found that different genotypes of rs4680 were not linked to chronic pain, although the study was conducted on lower abdominal hysterectomy.^[22]^ South Indian patients carrying the rs4680 A allele had higher pain scores 24 hours after major breast surgery, but this association was not found in postoperative pain after root canal treatment.^[23]^ For children, research results are also controversial. Some studies have found that variations in the COMT gene affect children’s pain sensitivity and postoperative morphine requirements in American children undergoing tonsillectomy.^[24]^ However, a study in Korea found that the COMT Val158Met gene polymorphism does not affect the analgesic effect of morphine on acute pain immediately after tonsillectomy in children.^[21]^ We studied common polymorphic sites of the COMT gene and found phenomena similar to those of Sadhasivam et al.^[24]^ We found that the rs4680 genotype was associated with postoperative pain scores in children with fractures. Children with the AA genotype showed higher pain scores within 24 hours after fracture surgery and required more sufentanil to control pain. The reason for this may be that the G472A allele produces a nonsynonymous change from valine to methionine at position 158 (Val158Met), which reduces the enzymatic activity with poor thermal stability, leading to increased levels of catecholamines and intensified pain,^[25]^ indicating that the COMT gene may be one of the genetic factors causing individual differences in sufentanil analgesia after fracture surgery in children. However, considering previous studies, the relationship between the COMT gene and pain may vary depending on the type of pain, ethnicity, and age (such as adults and children), and further large-sample, multicenter research evidence is needed to support it.

In addition, the main adverse reactions of sufentanil in children are nausea and vomiting.^[26]^ In our study, the incidence of nausea and vomiting during the follow-up period of postoperative analgesia treatment was 8.65%, but the analysis results showed that there was no difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting in children with different genotypes of rs4680 in COMT and rs1045642 in ABCB1, which indicates that these 2 genes may not be the main factors affecting the occurrence of nausea and vomiting in children after fracture surgery.

This study is a single-center, small-sample study, and the results have certain limitations. Postoperative acute pain is regulated by multiple processes, and it is known that there are many genes related to pain, and there may be synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects between different genes.^[27]^ Due to the limited number of cases, this study only analyzed the common mutation sites of COMT and ABCB1 with high relevance to pain and cannot exclude the interference of other related genes, which needs further research to confirm. In addition, this study observed in groups based on genotypes. Due to the natural mutation rate of genes and limitations of research conditions, the occurrence rates of different genotypes themselves have significant differences, and it is difficult to achieve an equal number of individuals in 3 groups within a certain period of time, which may lead to bias in data analysis and insufficient representativeness of the results in the general population. In subsequent studies, larger sample clinical studies are needed to balance it.

In conclusion, the polymorphisms of COMT gene rs4680 and ABCB1 gene rs1045642 are associated with postoperative pain and sufentanil consumption in pediatric patients after fracture surgery. Children carrying ABCB1 CC genotype tend to experience high early postoperative pain and increased sufentanil consumption. Pediatric patients with COMT AA genotype are more likely to show high pain scores within 24 hours after fracture surgery and require more sufentanil to control pain. These findings may contribute to the establishment of personalized pain management strategies for clinicians to effectively manage pain. Anesthetists can determine the postoperative analgesic drug use based on the polymorphic characteristics of children’s COMT gene rs4680 and ABCB1 gene rs1045642, thus enhancing children’s satisfaction with anesthesia and postoperative pain control.
