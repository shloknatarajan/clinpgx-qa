## Abstract

**Background:** 
Thiazide diuretics have been recommended as a first-line antihypertensive treatment, although the choice of ‘the right drug in the individual essential hypertensive patient’ remains still empirical. Essential hypertension is a complex, polygenic disease derived from the interaction of patient’s genetic background with the environment. Pharmacogenomics could be a useful tool to pinpoint gene variants involved in antihypertensive drug response, thus optimizing therapeutic advantages and minimizing side effects.

**Methods and results:** 
We looked for variants associated with blood pressure response to hydrochlorothiazide over an 8-week follow-up by means of a genome-wide association analysis in two Italian cohorts of never-treated essential hypertensive patients: 343 samples from Sardinia and 142 from Milan. TET2 and CSMD1 as plausible candidate genes to affect SBP response to hydrochlorothiazide were identified. The specificity of our findings for hydrochlorothiazide was confirmed in an independent cohort of essential hypertensive patients treated with losartan. Our best findings were also tested for replication in four independent hypertensive samples of European Ancestry, such as GENetics of drug RESponsiveness in essential hypertension, Genetic Epidemiology of Responses to Antihypertensives, NORdic DILtiazem intervention, Pharmacogenomics Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses, and Campania Salute Network-StayOnDiur. We validated a polymorphism in CSMD1 and UGGT2.

**Conclusion:** 
This exploratory study reports two plausible loci associated with SBP response to hydrochlorothiazide: TET2, an aldosterone-responsive mediator of αENaC gene transcription; and CSMD1, previously described as associated with hypertension in a case–control study.

## INTRODUCTION

Randomized trials on antihypertensive therapy do not show clinically relevant differences between drug classes, with regard to the ability of lowering blood pressure (BP), so that the choice of the ‘right medication in the individual patient’ remains empirical [[1](#R1)]. Thiazide diuretics remain a cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment, as they are effective, relatively safe and substantially well tolerated for the management of hypertension [[2](#R2)]. On the contrary, the mechanism to explain the well documented antihypertensive effects of thiazides is not fully understood. The known target of thiazide diuretics is the Na–K–Cl transport in the distal tubule of the nephron, where they reduce the reabsorption of sodium from the renal tubules, resulting in increased excretion of water and electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium. Thiazides reduce arterial peripheral resistance by activating calcium-activated potassium channels and inhibiting several carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue, thus causing vasodilatation [[3](#R3)].

Consensus is growing on the need to evaluate the clinical impact of gene variants with regard to antihypertensive drug response [[4](#R4)]. Gene variants affecting BP are expected to play a major role in the BP response to antihypertensive drugs. We previously suggested the role of several candidate genes in response to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) [[5](#R5)–[9](#R9)], but a great part of BP variation in response to this treatment is still poorly understood. Thanks to the genome-wide approach and new imputation panels, we could extend the analysis in order to identify new loci associated with the BP response to HCTZ. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis followed by a meta-analysis in two Italian cohorts of essential hypertensive patients treated with HCTZ [Pharmacogenomics of Hydrochlorothiazide Sardinian Study (PHSS) and HCTZ-Milan] aimed to identify new loci regulating BP response to HCTZ. We verified the specificity for HCTZ by testing the loci significantly associated with HCTZ response in a cohort of essential hypertensive patients treated with the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan [[10](#R10),[11](#R11)]. All the above mentioned evaluations were conducted in never-treated mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients: in fact, according to the literature, we strongly believe that washout periods of at least 6 months are necessary to clear the cell functions from the effects of antihypertensive treatments [[12](#R12)]. Thus, short washout periods of 8 weeks or even shorter could raise the ‘background noise’ that constitutes a major limitation to achieve reliable findings [[12](#R12)].We tested our findings for replication, using data from four independent hypertensive samples of European Ancestry: GENetics of drug RESponsiveness in essential hypertension (GENRES) [[13](#R13)], Genetic Epidemiology of Responses to Antihypertensives (GERA1) [[14](#R14)], NORdic DILtiazem intervention (NORDIL) [[15](#R15)], Pharmacogenomics Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) [[16](#R16)] and Campania Salute Network-StayOnDiur (CSN-StayOnDiur) [[17](#R17),[18](#R18)], although we were aware that the relevant differences in protocol design and cohort assembly could affect replication.

## MATERIAL ANDMETHODS

### Study participants

The PHSS protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Joint ASL n.1 – AOU Sassari Ethics Committee). Written informed consent was obtained for the study and for the DNA analysis, and all clinical investigation was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in [Methods S1](#SD1) ([Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)); [Fig. S1](#SD1) ([Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)) shows the entire patients’ flow from week –8 (start screening) to week +8 (end of the study).

Six hundred and one never-treated Caucasian essential hypertensive patients, whose BP was found to be at least 140/90mmHg at the first visit (week –8), were screened. The patients were recruited at the Hypertension and Related Disease Ctr of the AOU-University of Sassari, Italy. Only patients with asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were screened. A complete absence of major systemic disease and of any kind of treatment was also required. After the first visit, all the patients underwent an 8-week run-in period under controlled dietary conditions (sodium 100–140 mEq/day and potassium 50–70 mEq/day) to qualify for BP eligibility and to complete a clinical, instrumental and laboratory work-up to exclude secondary forms of hypertension. After the screening visit, BP was measured every 2 weeks and symptoms were recorded. Patients presenting either spontaneous normalization of BP, or high BP-related symptoms, or presenting a BP rise over the above-mentioned values were not enrolled in the study. At each visit, BP was measured three times consecutively (dominant arm) in the sitting position, by the same nurse in the absence of the physician, using a validated electronic device (OMRON 7051T; Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan), between 0800 and 1000 h. At the end of the run-in period (week 0), 146 patients did not confirm the inclusion and exclusion criteria; thus, at week 0, 455 mild-to-moderate never-treated essential hypertensive patients with SBP at least 140mmHg and DBP at least 90mmHg started the treatment with HCTZ 25mg o.d. for 8 weeks. Before starting treatment, blood for chemistry, baseline plasma renin activity and aldosterone, as well as 24-h urine, was collected. During the 8 weeks of HCTZ treatment, BP was measured about 24 h after the last HCTZ dose: seven patients were excluded from the study for poor compliance and 47 for hypokalaemia (serum potassium <3.5 mmol/l). Thus, the genotyped cohort was composed by 401 patients.

The Milan Hydrochlorothiazide study (HCTZ-Milan) protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of San Raffaele Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained for the study and for the DNA analysis, and all clinical investigation was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in [Methods S2](#SD1) ([Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)); [Fig. S2](#SD1) ([Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)) shows the entire patients’ flow from week −4 (start screening) to week +8 (end of the study). Two hundred and thirty-two newly discovered and never-treated participants with primary hypertension (defined by mean of three consecutive measurements of office SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥90mmHg) were enrolled after exclusion of secondary hypertension. During a 1-month run-in period in which participants were advised to eat a diet containing less than 150 mmol sodium daily, four patients did not confirm inclusion criteria, so they were excluded. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients were treated for 8 weeks with HCTZ, at a dose of 12.5mg daily for 4 weeks and 25mg daily for 4 further weeks. Before starting treatment, blood for chemistry, baseline plasma renin activity, aldosterone and urinary samples were collected. At each study visit, office BP was recorded in the sitting position by the same investigator using an OMRON 750IT monitor (Omron Healthcare; Kyoto, Japan), between 0800 and 1000 h, about 24 h after the last HCTZ dose. The last three stable measures taken after clinical examination were averaged and used in the analysis. The response to therapy was computed as the difference between the BP values after 8 weeks of HCTZ therapy described above and the BP values at the last pretreatment visit. During the 8 weeks of treatment with HCTZ, one patient was lost to follow-up; six patients left the study for poor compliance; two for worsening of BP values and four for side effects. The genotyped sample was composed by 215 patients.

### Genotyping and imputing

Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood collected at week 0 (Macherey-Nagel kit, NucleoSpin Blood XL, Düren, Germany; or with standard method).

Two hundred and eighty-two PHSS patients were genotyped using the Illumina Human1M-Duo array (Illumina Inc, San Diego, California, USA) within HYPERGENES project [[19](#R19)] and 119 using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress array within InterOmics project ([http://www.interomics.eu/](http://www.interomics.eu/)).

Two hundred and fifteen HCTZ-Milan samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human1M-Duo array within HYPERGENES project [[19](#R19)].

The imputation was performed using Minimac [[20](#R20)] and 1000 Genomes haplotypes as reference (release March 2012). Imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with low imputation quality (Rsq < 0.8) were not used in the association analysis. Genotyping and imputation details are in [Methods S5](#SD1) ([Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)).

### Statistical analysis

We analyzed patients with both SBP at least 140mmHg and DBP at least 90 mmHg. For this reason, before performing the association analysis, we excluded 28 patients with DBP below 90mmHg (13%) and 36 patients with SBP below 140mmHg (16.7%) from HCTZ-Milan cohort, leaving 151 patients. The analyzed phenotype was the variation of BP (systolic and diastolic) after 8 weeks of treatment (ΔSBP8, ΔDBP8), defined as the difference between the BP at the end of treatment (week +8) and the BP at the end of the run-in period (week 0). The quality control was performed in accordance with the protocol by Anderson *et al*. [[21](#R21)] (see [Methods S6 and S7, Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)). We assessed population stratification with principal component analysis, using EIGENSOFT package [[22](#R22),[23](#R23)] (version 3.0) (see [Methods S6 and S7, and Fig. S4, Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)). Measured SNPs with call rate above 99% and minor allele frequency greater than 3% were included in the dataset, according to Anderson *et al*. protocol [[21](#R21)] and as described by Turner *et al*. [[24](#R24)] (see [Methods S6 and S7, Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)).

After quality control, PHSS sample was composed by 343 patients (223 men and 120 women) and HCTZ-Milan sample by 142 patients (118 men and 24 women).

To assess the genotype-to-phenotype association for each cohort we performed a linear regression on ΔSBP8 and ΔDBP8 under an additive model, adjusted for sex, age, basal BP and for ancestry principal components, as implemented in Mach2qtl [[25](#R25),[26](#R26)]. We performed a meta-analysis of results, as implemented in METAL [[27](#R27)]. Markers were filtered out for minor allele frequency (MAF <3%) and for imputation quality (Rsq <0.8), leaving approximately 6 million markers.

To verify the specificity of the identified markers for response to HCTZ, we performed a linear regression analysis applying the model described above, in an independent Italian sample of 372 essential hypertensive patients treated with 50 mg/day losartan (see [Methods S3 and Fig. S3, Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)) [[10](#R10),[11](#R11)].

### Replication cohorts

The GENRES study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled antihypertensive drug trial in 233 moderately hypertensive Finnish men, aged 35–60 years. Each study participant received losartan 50mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, HCTZ 25mg, and amlodipine 5mg daily, each as a monotherapy in randomized order for 4 weeks. In this replication study, office BP data were used and 214 patients with HCTZ response and GWAS data were included.

The GERA1 study comprised 300 hypertensive European Americans from Rochester, Minnesota, treated with HCTZ at a dose of 25mg daily for 4 weeks following a drug-free washout period of at least 4 weeks.

The NORDIL study is a prospective, randomized, open, and blinded endpoint study conducted at 1032 healthcare centers in Sweden and Norway between 1992 and 1999. Participants were randomized to treatment with either the nonselective calcium channel blocker diltiazem or to therapy with beta-blockers, diuretics, or both. From these, 383 participants on monotherapy with a thiazide diuretic during the first 6 months of the study were selected for the current replication.

The PEAR study was conducted in two groups of African and White Americans, whose office, home, ambulatory day-time and night-time BP responses were measured and a weighted average BP response was calculated. HCTZ (or atenolol) therapy began at a dose of 12.5mg (or 50 mg) daily for 2 weeks. Because our samples included only Europeans, we focused only on the cohort from PEAR that was European American and treated with HCTZ monotherapy for replication (*n* = 228).

The CSN-StayOnDiur study sample consisted of 617 patients of white European descent aged 18–75 years and treated with chlorthalidone 12.5–25mg daily. For replication, we analyzed 438 patients from CSN-StayOnDiur cohort that fit with our inclusion criteria (basal SBP ≥140mmHg and basal DBP ≥90mmHg) (for more details see [Table 1](#T1) and [Methods S4, Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)).

## RESULTS

Characteristics of the study cohorts are reported in [Table 2](#T2). Study participants from PHSS were white Caucasians and included 120 women (35%). Age averaged 49.2 years (SD ± 8.7); pretreatment average (±SD) SBP and DBP were 158.6 (± 13.4)/103 (±7.7) mmHg, respectively. After quality control of the 401 samples genotyped, 343 patients were available for the analysis. The HCTZ-Milan cohort was composed by white Caucasians and included 24 women (17%). Age averaged 46.3 years (SD ± 8.1); pretreatment mean (±SD) SBP and DBP were 153.5 (±10.6)/101.5 (±7.4) mmHg. After quality control and exclusion for BP selection of the 215 samples genotyped, 142 patients were available for the analysis. PHSS and HCTZ-Milan samples have comparable values of pretreatment DBP, serum potassium and urine sodium. Age, BMI and pretreatment SBP were higher in the PHSS cohort, whereas urine potassium was higher in HCTZ-Milan cohort.

We performed a linear regression analysis in the two independent cohorts in order to identify polymorphisms associated with ΔSBP8 or ΔDBP8, adjusted for ancestry principal components, sex, age and basal SBP or DBP. We then performed a meta-analysis of the results. Although no SNPs reached the genome-wide significance level for meta-analysis association with SBP and DBP response to HCTZ, we decided to consider as significant a threshold of *P* value 10^−5^ or less, as suggested by the q–q plots (see [Fig. S5, Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467)). In fact, SNPs *P* value deviated above the diagonal that is the distribution reference line, at a level 10^−5^ or less. So we selected 141 SNPs for ΔSBP8 and 130 SNPs for ΔDBP, which were significant in both cohorts and having meta-analysis *P* value 10^−5^ or less (see [Tables S1 and S2](#SD2), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A468](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A468), [Figs S6 and S7](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A467), [Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1)). In order to exclude redundant findings, we filtered out SNPs that were in linkage disequilibrium with each other (*r*^2^ ≥0.8). We also excluded SNPs mapping in desert regions.

We identified six SNPs associated with ΔSBP8 ([Table 3](#T3)): rs12505746 in Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) gene (beta −5.4 ± 1.2, *P* value 9.40 × 10^−6^); rs7387065 and rs11993031 in CUB and Sushi multiple domains protein 1 (CSMD1) gene (beta −3.5 ± 0.7, *P* value 1.71 × 10^−6^; beta −3.4 ± 0.7, *P* value 7.65 × 10^−6^); rs9285669 in serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 14 (SPINK14) gene (beta −3.8 ± 0.8, *P* value 7.09 × 10^−7^); rs11189015 in slit homolog 1 (Drosophila) (SLIT1) gene (beta −10.1 ± 2.2, *P* value 4.54 × 10^−6^); rs9915451 in ankyrin-repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (ANKFN1) gene (beta −4.1 ± 0.9, *P* value 4.01 × 10^−6^).

We identified five SNPs associated with ΔDBP8 ([Table 4](#T4)): rs4431329 and rs7706429 in F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 17 (FBXL17) gene (beta −2.9 ± 0.6, *P* value 1.28 × 10^−6^; beta −2.6 ± 0.6, *P* value 3.01 × 10^−6^); rs9590353 in UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 2 (UGGT2) gene (beta −4.6 ± 1.0, *P* value 5.39 × 10^−6^); rs113095083 in integrin-linked kinase-associated serine/ threonine phosphatase (ILKAP) gene (beta −6.5 ± 1.4, *P* value 6.37 × 10^−6^); and rs77876672 in diaphanous-related formin 3 (DIAPH3) gene (beta −5.6 ± 1.3, *P* value 9.47 × 10^−6^). To assess the specificity for HCTZ of these SNPs, we tested their association with ΔSBP8 or ΔDBP8 in 372 patients treated with losartan. All tested SNPs were specific for BP response to HCTZ (see [Tables S3 and S4](#SD2), [Supplemental Digital Content](#SD1), [http://links.lww.com/HJH/A468](http://links.lww.com/HJH/A468)).

To test for replication we used data from different studies: GENRES, GERA1, NORDIL, PEAR and CSN-StayOn-Diur. Rs7387065 in CSMD1 gene was significantly associated with SBP response in GENRES cohort (*P* value 0.04, beta −2.2 ± 1.1), and showed the same directionality of effect in NORDIL cohort though not significant; moreover, rs7387065 was significantly associated with SBP response in PEAR cohort (*P* value 0.03), but with opposite directionality of effect ([Table 5](#T5)). A tag SNP of rs12505746 (TET2 gene) was present in GENRES study, and it showed a not significant or borderline trend for replication (ΔSBP *P* value 0.33, ΔDBP *P* value 0.02) into the same direction. Otherwise, we could not replicate the effect size, probably due to the high interindividual variability of BP response.

Table 5 Caption: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with SBP response to hydrochlorothiazide in meta-analysis between PHSS and HCTZ-Milan samples and replication results in GENRES, GERA1, NORDIL, PEAR and CSN-StayOnDiur samples

Rs9590353 in UGGT2 gene was associated with DBP response in CSN-StayOnDiur sample (*P* value 0.04, beta −3.65 ± 1.75).

We also tested for replication in the same cohorts the other findings, associated with ΔSBP8 or ΔDBP8, with a *P* value less than 10^−5^, but no significant results were found (*P* value >0.05) or the SNPs were not available.

## DISCUSSION

We performed a combined analysis in two Italian cohorts of never-treated mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients to search for genetic variants predictive of BP response to HCTZ. Overall, we identified 141 SNPs (ΔSBP8) and 130 (ΔDBP8) with a *P* value less than 10^−5^. The specificity of our findings for HCTZ was tested in a different cohort of never treated mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients treated with losartan. After exclusion of SNPs redundant for linkage disequilibrium, six markers were associated with the SBP response to HCTZ at a *P* value less than 10^−5^, whereas five SNPs were associated with the DBP response at the same *P* value.

In particular, SNP rs12505746 mapping in intron region of TET2 gene as well as SNPs rs7387065 and rs11993031 mapping in intron region of CUB and Sushi multiple domains protein 1 (CSMD1) gene represent the most plausible candidates for BP regulation by HCTZ ([Figs 1](#F1) and [2](#F2)).

Plot of blood pressure response to hydrochlorothiazide by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 rs12505746 (a), and CUB and Sushi multiple domains protein 1 rs11993031 (b), and rs7387065 (c) genotypes of participants from the two cohorts (Pharmacogenomics of Hydrochlorothiazide Sardinian Study and hydrochlorothiazide-Milan). The blood pressure response is adjusted for pretreatment blood pressure level, age, sex and principal components. In each box the number of patients for each genotype is reported.

Tet2 catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and plays a key role in active DNA demethylation [[28](#R28)]. Yu *et al*. [[29](#R29)] demonstrated that aldosterone stimulates the recruitment of TET2 to demethylate the epithelial sodium channel alpha epithelial sodium channel (αENaC) promoter to induce αENaC transcription. As already known, aldosterone increases tubular Na+ reabsorption by increasing αENaC transcription in collecting duct cells. They proved that treatment of collecting duct cells with 1 µ mol/l aldosterone disperses DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) from the αENaC R3 subregion and recruits Tet2 to convert 5mC to 5hmC at this subregion to contribute to the derepression of αENaC transcription. The study identified Tet2 as aldosterone-responsive mediator of αENaC gene transcription in inner medullary collecting duct cells [[29](#R29)]. As the handing of sodium is one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms regulating BP, a gene-dependent up-regulation of the ENaC activity may lead to sodium retention and consequently volume expansion ultimately affecting BP. Recently, a novel feed-forward activation of endothelial sodium channel (EnNaC) by sodium that contrasts ENaC feedback inhibition in the kidney has been proposed [[30](#R30)]. There is evidence that aldosterone increases EnNaC synthesis and membrane abundance as in the kidney. Thus, plasma sodium enters the endothelium leading to endothelial cells cortex stiffening and a reduced nitric oxide production, and ultimately increasing BP [[31](#R31)]. We may hypothesize that TET2 could induce also EnNaC transcription, thus affecting cardiovascular outcome in addition to BP response to HCTZ; further studies are needed to clarify its role.

The CSMD1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the vacuolar-protein-sorting-13 family. In yeast, this protein is involved in membrane proteins trafficking, although the function of the human protein has not yet been clarified [[32](#R32)]. However, CUB and Sushi domains are found in many other proteins and are believed to be sites of either protein–protein or protein–ligand interactions [[33](#R33),[34](#R34)]. Recently, the CSMD1 gene was associated with peripheral arterial disease [[35](#R35)] and metabolic syndrome [[36](#R36)]. Moreover, CSMD1 gene was associated with increased risk of hypertension in two case–control studies in Korean cohorts, but it is not clear how CSMD1 could contribute to BP regulation [[37](#R37)].

We assessed the specificity for HCTZ of these SNPs, testing their association with ΔSBP8 or ΔDBP8 in patients treated with losartan. All tested SNPs were specific for BP response to HCTZ.

We tested our top findings in four independent clinical trials for diuretics: GENRES, GERA1, NORDIL, PEAR and CSN-StayOnDiur. Office BP response for all study participants was analyzed. Whilst this is a heterogeneous group of trials in terms of the study design, run-in periods, drug exposure periods and baseline BP in contrast to the rigorous design of the PHSS and HCTZ-Milan studies, we hypothesized that concordant directionality of effect would support the validity of our signals. Indeed, GENRES and NORDIL showed similar direction of effect for rs7387065 in gene CSMD1 and thus validated indirectly our signal. Rs7387065 was significantly associated with SBP response in GENRES cohort with the same directionality of effect, and in PEAR cohort, but with opposite directionality of effect. A tag SNP of TET2 rs12505746 in GENRES cohort was associated with ΔDBP, but not with ΔSBP. In CSN-StayOnDiur sample, rs9590353 (UGGT2 gene) was associated with DBP response into the same direction. UGGT2 gene encodes a glycoprotein; its biological function has not been yet clarified [[38](#R38)].

A true replication requires independent studies with similar protocols as reflected in our PHSS and HCTZ-Milan cohorts. Whereas this may not be feasible for post-hoc analysis of clinical trials, consistent results from these analyses can inform and catalyze more targeted clinical trials to dissect these signals.

Previous studies have reported polymorphisms in candidate genes as predictors of BP response to HCTZ: rs5443 polymorphism in GNB3 [[39](#R39)]; ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism [[40](#R40)]; rs1799983 polymorphism of NOS3 [[41](#R41)]; rs2107614, rs2277869, and rs1159744 in WNK1; rs2400707 in ADRB2; rs5723 and rs5729 in SCNN1G [[42](#R42)]; rs4149601 in NEDD4L [[43](#R43)]; rs6749447 and rs3754777 in STK39 [[44](#R44),[45](#R45)]; rs10792367, located between OAT1 and OAT3 [[46](#R46)]; rs1894111 and rs4930416 in ADRBK1 [[47](#R47)]. None of them achieved *P* values less than 10^−5^ in the present study.

The GWA approach has also been previously pursued in the pharmacogenomics of HCTZ. In 2008, Turner *et al*. [[48](#R48)] suggested that haplotype from rs317689 to rs7297610 on chromosome 12q15 was associated with BP response to HCTZ in the African-Americans. In 2012, Duarte *et al*. [[49](#R49)] identified rs2269879 in DOT1L gene in Caucasians. Subsequently, McDonough *et al*. [[50](#R50)] suggested that rs4149601, rs292449, and rs75982813 in NEDD4L may be predictors of BP response to HCTZ in whites. In the same year, Turner *et al*. [[51](#R51)] identified rs16960228 in PRKCA and rs2273359 in the GNAS-EDN3 region. None of these SNPs achieved a *P* value < 10^−5^ in our study.

In conclusion, we reported suggestive loci associated to SBP response to HCTZ: TET2, an aldosterone-responsive mediator of αENaC gene transcription, and CSMD1, previously described as associated to hypertension in a case– control study. Further replication is needed to confirm these SNPs as markers of BP reponse to HCTZ.

The present exploratory study has some limitations. First, phenothypic and study design heterogeneity diminished the possibility to obtain consistently replication of our finding across the different analyzed cohorts. Second, our approach has limited statistical power to evaluate associations of BP response with rare SNPs. Finally, our findings map in intron or flanking gene regions. For these reasons, it is difficult to understand their functional role. We can hypothesize that the gene polymorphisms found in our study could be in linkage disequilibrium with causal variants that influence gene structure and protein expression or could map functional loci not yet identified. That being so, the present study can be considered as a starting point for elucidating the role of genetic variants regulating BP response to HCTZ, though further replication is needed to confirm the reported SNPs as markers of BP reponse to HCTZ.
