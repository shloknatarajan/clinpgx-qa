Keywords: Cisplatin nephrotoxicity, Genetic polymorphisms, Transient receptor potential ankyrin-1, Chinese population

### Introduction

Irreversible acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by cisplatin limits its clinical use, and transient receptor potential anchor protein 1 (TRPA1) regulates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) through NF-κB signaling pathway-mediated inflammation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TRPA1 and NF-κB1 genes may be associated with individual heterogeneous nephrotoxicity.

### Materials and methods

In this paper, we investigated the association of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of TRPA1 and NF-κB1 genes with cisplatin-induced acute nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity and its severity were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 5.0). SNPs were measured by 48-Plex SNPscan® high-throughput SNP typing echnology in DNA isolated from peripheral blood of 589 Chinese Han lung cancer patients (241 with CIN and 348 without CIN) treated with cisplatin regimen.

### Results

TRAP1 gene rs920829 locus T allele carriers had a reduced risk of nephrotoxicity relative to C allele carriers (OR 0.684, 95 % CI 0.524–0.894, *p* = 0.003), and their additive and dominant models showed similar trends as well. However, the SNPs of NF-κB1 were not observed to be correlated with nephrotoxicity.

### Conclusion

SNPs of TRPA1 have the potential as biomarkers for predicting cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

## Introduction

Lung Cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in China and Worldwide [[1](#bib0001),[2](#bib0002)]. Lung cancer contributes to 30 % of all cancer deaths in China [[1](#bib0001)]. Interms of incidence, lung cancer ranks first in China, themortality rate of Chinese males was 50 % in 20,20^1^. Cisplatin has an affinity for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and other intracellular nucleophilic reagents and has potent anticancer properties and efficacy by disrupting DNA repair mechanisms and inhibiting DNA replication, leading to causing cell cycle arrest and death [[3](#bib0003)]. The primary chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of lung cancer still contains cisplatin, despite the rising use of targeted and other new drugs [[4](#bib0004)]. However, it results in a number of non-target toxicities, including gastrointestinal problems, hematologic toxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity, which not only compromise patient quality of life but also result in treatment failure [[5](#bib0005)]. Due to renal tubular injury and/or increased serum creatinine (SCr), nephrotoxicity is a common side effect of cisplatin that affects 20 % to 70 % of patients [[5](#bib0005)]. Additionally, 25–35 % of individuals experience reduced renal function following a single dosage of cisplatin, and additional treatments may make the problem worse and cause permanent damage [[5](#bib0005),[6](#bib0006)]. The complicated pathophysiological mechanisms behind cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury include cellular uptake and efflux, apoptosis, vascular damage, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation [[3](#bib0003),[7](#bib0007)]. The main targets of its process, however, have not yet been fully understood and are difficult to reduce or undo once the harm has been done [[5](#bib0005)].

Significant inter-individual heterogeneity in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity suggests both non-genetic and genetic causes. Age, gender, health issues, environmental factors, smoking, alcohol use, and co-morbidities are the key non-genetic factors [[8](#bib0008)]. Through the study of genetic and non-genetic risk factors, efforts have been undertaken to preventatively target people who are more likely to experience negative effects [[8](#bib0008)]. Although the published literature on genetic determinants for the majority of cisplatin-induced toxicity is very young, some significant trends have emerged [[6](#bib0006)]. Pharmacogenomics has discovered single nucleotide polymorphisms in ACYP2 and WFS1 related to cisplatin-induced hearing loss using genome-wide association analyses, indicating that genetic variability is a significant factor in cisplatin ototoxicity [[6](#bib0006)]. Genome-wide association studies can find pathogenic SNPs in genes that are agnostic, but they need a large number of patients who receive the same treatment and uniform toxicity phenotyping, and their results are challenging to generalize to other populations because of inherent variations in allele frequencies and effect sizes among ancestral individuals [[6](#bib0006)]. Although studies of genetic polymorphisms on the adverse effects of cisplatin have found that specific SNPs correlate with varying efficacy and toxicity, comparable studies on polymorphisms in cisplatin nephrotoxicity are scarce and primarily focused on drug metabolism and transport genes and DNA repair genes [[9](#bib0009)], and have not yet been reported in inflammation and oxidative stress genes [[5](#bib0005),[10](#bib0010)]. Given the frequent usage of cisplatin among Chinese people and the lack of effective treatments or preventative measures for CIN. In order to comprehend molecular pathways and choose specialized treatments, it is essential to choose molecules in important pathways for the correlation of genetic vulnerability in the Chinese population according to their pathogenic mechanisms.

The peripheral end of primary afferent neurons carries the transient receptor potential anchor protein-1 (TRPA1) ion channel, which is a highly conserved main oxidant sensor of painful reactivity [[11](#bib0011)]. Upregulating TRPA1 function has been shown to maintain or even exacerbate inflammatory responses, including gouty arthritis brought on by monosodium urate crystals and arthritis brought on by monosodium iodoacetate [[12](#bib0012),[13](#bib0013)]. Conversely, downregulating TRPA1 function has been shown to attenuate inflammation and airway hyperreactivity, among other things. Human renal tubular epithelial cells produced TRPA1, and hypoxia and reoxygenation greatly elevated TRPA1 expression, resulting in acute tubular cell damage, according to a previous study of ours [[14](#bib0014)]. In a longitudinal cohort study, Gallo V^15^ et al. investigated the relationship between TRPA1 gene variants and childhood asthma and total IgE levels. They discovered six SNPs that varied in their correlation with asthma and IgE levels, indicating that their polymorphisms are linked to inflammatory and stress responses with genetic heterogeneity [[15](#bib0015)]. The modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, as well as organismal homeostasis and the healing of wounds, are important functions of NF-B. The Rel family of proteins, which also includes RelAp (65), RelB, cRel, NF-B1 (p50 and p105), and NF-B2 (p52 and p100), includes nuclear factor-B (NF-B) [[16](#bib0016)]. The p50/p65 heterodimer is the most common complex with the highest content and is present in almost all cells in vivo [[17](#bib0017)]. p105 and p50 subunits are encoded by the NF-B1 gene through selective splicing. As a result, the NF-B1 gene is a crucial component of the NF-B signaling pathway [[18](#bib0018)]. Numerous inflammatory immune-related illnesses, including inflammatory bowel disease and several gastrointestinal malignancies, have been linked to genetic variants in the NF-B1 gene [[18](#bib0018),[19](#bib0019)]. Tumor necrosis factor can cause cellular damage by activating the NF-κB pathway and causing a substantial amount of reactive oxygen species to be released [[20](#bib0020)]. Cisplatin also disrupts calcium homeostasis and increases calcium efflux from mitochondria, which causes apoptosis and inflammation in renal cells and ultimately results in renal failure. These additional effects of cisplatin include an imbalance in intracellular oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which activates multiple signaling cascades and causes the release of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines [[21](#bib0021)].

The group has previously identified that TRPA1 promotes cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity through the NF-κB pathway [[22](#bib0022)], and there is a lack of data to support the potential role of its polymorphisms in nephrotoxicity. We plan to explore the impact of the interaction of TRPA1 and NF-κB1 polymorphisms with the imbalance of oxidative stress caused by cisplatin on the renal injury.

2.2. Throughout each treatment cycle, toxicology information pertinent to the evaluation of cisplatin therapy (defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0) was documented at least weekly [[23](#bib0023)]. This is how acute renal damage was rated: Grade 1, increased levels of creatinine >0.3 mg/dL or levels 1.5–2.0 times higher than baseline; grade 2, levels 2–3 times higher than baseline; grade 3, levels >3 times higher than baseline or absolute levels above 4.0 mg/dL or requiring hospitalization; and grade 4, life-threatening consequences or requiring dialysis [[23](#bib0023)]. Other adverse reactions include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, neuropathy, weakness, hypersensitivity reactions, and nephrotoxic reactions. After 2 and 14 cycles, oncologic outcome reporting criteria were used to classify patient responses to treatment into 4 categories: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressing illness (PD) [[24](#bib0024)].

### Candidate single nucleotide polymorphism selection and genotyping

The 1000 Genomes database and haploView software was used to screen the candidate SNPs of *TRPA1* and *NF-ΚB1* with the screening principles as follows (11,19): minimum allele frequency ≥20 % in the southern Chinese Han population; linkage disequilibrium value r^2^ ≥0.8; located in the region where the candidate genes are located 500 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream; SNPs in exons, promoters, or untranslated regions (UTRs) with prior choice. All together, 17 SNPs which were successfully designed with PCR primers and single-base amplification primers were successfully typed using 48-Plex SNPscan® high-throughput SNP typing echnology [[25](#bib0025)]^.^ Thirty samples were randomly selected for double-blind experiments to ensure the repeatability and stability of the genotyping results, and all the genotype calling success rates were greater than 99.0 % [[26](#bib0026)]. Both the clinical data collectors and the genetic testers were double-blinded with regard to the clinical data profiles of the patients.

### Statistical analysis

Quantitative data obeying normal distribution were compared with *t*-test or ANOVA for; Quantitative data with non-normal distribution were compared with Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests; count data were compared with Chi-square test with SPSS software (version 23.0). The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for all control SNPs and associations between the SNPs and CIN were evaluated using unconditional logistic regression after adjusting for age by PLINK software version 1.07. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis were conducted with Haplotype software version 4.2. The odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI) was used as a measure of association [[27](#bib0027)].

## Results

### Demographic data and clinical characteristics of the subjects

A total of 589 patients (241 with CIN and 348 without CIN) were included in this study with no differences in age(*p* = 0.797) or gender(*p* = 0.402) between the two groups. The CIN cases did not show a higher likelihood of smoking (*p* = 0.194) or drinking(*p* = 0.058). Regarding disease severity stage, kind of pathology, choice of cisplatin-based therapy regimen received, and treatment result, there were no statistical differences between the two groups. Baseline values of Urea, Crea, Cyc-C and Uric did not differ between the two groups (all *p* > 0.05). The Non-CIN cases showed higher base line of TG, CHOL, HDL-C and LDL-C (all *p* < 0.05). The demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory indicators of the patients are depicted in [Table 1](#tbl0001). CIN was reported in 40.91 % of patients, with stage 1 injuries occurring in 170 (70.54 %), stage 2 injuries in 52, stage 3 injuries in 13 patients, and stage 4 injuries in 2 patients (2.5 %).

## SNP alleles, genotypes, genetic models and haplotype analysis

All alleles of TRPA1 and NF-κB1 were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. (HWE) (*p* > 0.05) ([Table 2](#tbl0002)). rs920829 in TRPA1 showed statistical significance; the proportion of the T allele was 110/372 (22.80 %) in CIN group and 210/486 (30.17 %) in non-CIN group (*p* = 0.005). After Bonferroni correction, the frequency distribution of alleles still showed statistical differences (*p* = 0.00529).The occurrence of the TT/CT/CC genotype was less common in the CIN group compared with the non-CIN group (20/70/151 vs 31/148/169, *p* = 0.002). No significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies of the other SNPs were observed between the two groups. The distributions of the genotype and allele frequencies for all SNPs are depicted in [Table 2](#tbl0002).

Table 2 Caption: The distributions of allele and genotype frequencies of all SNPs.

Dominant, recessive and additive pattern of genetic models were generated to determine the significance of each SNP, as shown in [Table 3](#tbl0003). Of note, the homozygous TT genotype of rs920829 was correlated with a decreased risk of CIN compared with those with the C allele (TT/CT genotype) in the additive model (OR 0.698, 95 % CI 0.539–0.907, *p* = 0.007) and dominant model (OR 0.563, 95 % CI 0.403–0.787, *p* < 0.001), as shown in [Table 3](#tbl0003). No genetic model was associated even marginally with CIN for the other SNPs**.**

Haplotypes were generated to analyse whether there were additive associations among the selected SNPs with a pairwise r^2^>0.80. There were one haplotype for TRPA1 and two haplotypes for NF-ΚB1 with a frequency >0.05 and in a strong linkage disequilibrium state by pairwise r2 coefficient > 0.80. ([Table 4](#tbl0004)). However, none was associated with CIN (*p* > 0.05). S2 Figure depict the loci of TRPA1 and NF-ΚB1 in the linkage disequilibrium block risk.

## Discussion

In a non-related Han Chinese population, our study reveals the first identification of a genetic variant in TRPA1 linked to chemotherapy-related toxicity in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. There were no differences in the gender or ages of these lung cancer patients with varying clinical stages and the pathological types who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. The frequency of CIN in our research population was close to the 30.5–37.9 % reported in the literature, with 155 cases (64.31 %) developing CIN during the first treatment cycle [[7](#bib0007),[28](#bib0028),[29](#bib0029)]. The great majority of acute kidney injuries had stage I-II injuries. We identified the T variant of rs920829 as a protective factor for CIN with allele frequencies of 110/372 (22.8 %/77.2 %) and 210/486 (30.2 %/69.8 %) in the CIN and non-CIN groups, respectively, with an OR of 0.684, 95 % CI 0.524–0.894, *p* = 0.003. In the genotype distribution, the TT/TC/CC frequencies were 110/372/1 (8.3 %/29.0 %/62.7 %) and 31/148/169 (8.9 %/42.5 %/48.6 %) in the CIN and non-CIN groups, respectively, with an OR of 0.911, 95 % CI 0.150–0.678, *p* = 0.007 in the additive model; in the dominant model the OR was 0.563, 95 % CI 0.403–0.787, *p* < 0.001.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, which are members of a large family of ion channels with >50 isoforms and a conserved structure, control cellular processes related to cation currents primarily through intracellular calcium-dependent pathways. They can, however, also be crucial for homeostatic processes in vivo as integrators of various signaling systems [[11](#bib0011)]. The human trpa1 gene has 27 exons that span 55,701 base pairs and is found on chromosome 8q13. Comparatively speaking to other TRPs, TRPA1 has a relatively extended anchor protein repeat region at the NH2 terminus leading to higher calcium permeability [[21](#bib0021)]. TRPA1 is a key player in inflammatory and immunological reactions and functions as a sensor of cellular damage signaling [[30](#bib0030)]. The upregulation of TRPA1 activity, which results in the production or worsening of inflammatory reactions, can be caused by an increase in intracellular calcium for a variety of reasons [[11](#bib0011),[30](#bib0030)]. Our previous study showed that TRPA1 is expressed in human renal tubular epithelial cells and that hypoxia and reoxygenation can mimic AKI to significantly increase TRPA1 expression [[14](#bib0014)]. Additionally, we discovered that TRPA1 promoted cellular inflammation and death in HEK293 cells in vitro via the MAPK/NF-B signaling pathway, further pointing to TRPA1′s participation in mediating CIN [[22](#bib0022)]. Numerous TRPA1 antagonists have undergone corresponding clinical trials for the treatment of pain or other inflammatory-related disorders in light of the pro-inflammatory effects of TRPA1^11^.

Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain some of the individual CIN epistasis, highlighting the significance of genetic diversity. Advances and breakthroughs in such studies may eventually lead to treatment regimens and doses that can be individualized to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize toxicities, but there are currently no clear genetic loci associated with CIN [[6](#bib0006)]. Relatively more association studies are currently available for genes related to cisplatin uptake and transport [[9](#bib0009),[10](#bib0010),[31](#bib0031),[32](#bib0032)]. Increasing excretion or decreasing cisplatin absorption, however, also signifies a decline in the equivalent efficacy. Given that cellular uptake and accumulation are not the only important molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin's induction of nephrotoxic side effects, but also inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular damage, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, necrosis, and apoptosis [[3](#bib0003)], polymorphisms and even epigenetic characteristics of associated genes have been proposed to be relevant to CIN, such as mutations in the XRCC1 gene Variants in the ERCC1 and ERCC2 genes (rs11615 and rs3212986) and ERCC2 (rs13181) have both been linked to an elevated risk of nephrotoxicity [[8](#bib0008),[10](#bib0010)]. However, a lack of a link between ERCC1 (C8092A) single nucleotide polymorphisms and the effectiveness/toxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer has also been proposed based on the heterogeneity of the study population [[31](#bib0031)].

We chose TRPA1-related SNPs for research using tagSNP screening in light of the importance of SNPs to gene function. SNP variants in a gene's coding area or regulatory region may impact gene expression or potentially gene function. for the diagnosis of diseases like the onset of sickle cell anemia, -thalassemia, and cystic fibrosis, as well as to aid in the prediction of a person's response to specific medications, susceptibility to environmental factors like toxins, and the likelihood of contracting particular diseases [[[33]](#bib0033), [[34]](#bib0034), [[35]](#bib0035)]. TRPA1 has been examined in external stimuli, neuropathic pain states, and particular inflammation since it is activated in inflammatory pain models and induces pain and hyperalgesia [[15](#bib0015)]. Researchers hypothesized that wild gene carriers of rs920829 may have a higher propensity for peripheral and/or central injury receptor sensitization compared to mutant gene carriers after finding that wild gene carriers of TRPA1 in neuropathic pain patients were less prone to paradoxical heat sensation associated with the genotype carrying the wild gene and also less prone to paradoxical heat sensation [[36](#bib0036)]. By examining the relationship between TRPA1 polymorphisms and stimulus sensing and pain, Ellie H. Jhun [[37](#bib0037)] et al. discovered that patients who carried the rs920829 mutation gene had a higher risk of needing acute care for pain than carriers of the wild genotype, indicating that mutation carriers are more sensitive to painful stimuli. A missense mutation called rs920829C>*T* converts the glutamate residue to lysine. Although no appreciable changes in protein folding or stability were seen, it may have an impact on the anchor protein repeat sequence's electrostatic characteristics, influencing the interactions between proteins or other ligands and eventually changing ligand affinity[38](#bib0038). Therefore, we speculate that the T variation may prevent the inflammatory reactions brought on by cisplatin by causing TRPA1 to lose function, express less, or have a lower affinity for its ligands.

Considering the possible involvement of TRPA1 in CIN through TRPA1 via the NF-κB signaling pathway, we also conducted an association study on the genetic polymorphism of NF-ΚB1 and constructed a haploid model of TRAP1 and NF-ΚB1 in an attempt to discover potential correlations, but no specific findings were made. Although the T variant of rs920829 was associated with the risk of CIN, no correlation was observed with the severity of CIN. The possible reasons for this are 1) CIN is the result of the combined action of multiple signaling molecules and regulatory pathways, 2) during the study, healthcare providers observed and recorded patients' clinical indications and symptoms at a frequency of at least once a week and, depending on the situation, performed timely and symptomatic management, which avoided CIN progression to some extent.

The strength of the present study is that we demonstrated for the first time that TRPA1 gene polymorphism is correlated with the incidence of CIN from a genetic perspective through a moderate number of sample sizes. This study also has some shortcomings as follows: 1) the chemotherapy response was chosen as a predictive endpoint in the context of clinical reality, and overall survival and progression-free survival were not evaluated as prognostic factors; 2) chronic kidney injury was not observed, as the pathological mechanism of the transition from AKI to CKD is unclear and there is no consensus on the dose or timing of cisplatin-induced CKD [[39](#bib0039)]; 3) functional validation was not performed at the cellular level or functional validation at the animal model level.

In summary, we found for the first time that the T variant of the TRPA1 gene rs920829 in the Chinese Han population reduces the risk of CIN.
