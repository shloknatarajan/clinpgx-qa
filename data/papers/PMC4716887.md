## Abstract

Allelic variants of genes implicated in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) determine the pharmacokinetic variability of many medications and are increasingly recognized as important factors determining the success or failure of medical treatments. Both tacrolimus and sirolimus have narrow therapeutic ranges maintained by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Using an ADME Panel that covers >99% of the PharmaADME working group core list (188 single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] and 12 copy number variant [CNV] assays in 36 pharmacogenetically relevant genes), we studied 177 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using tacrolimus/sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We tested for possible associations between ADME variants and tacrolimus/sirolimus drug levels, concentration/dose (C/D) ratio, and clinical endpoints including acute GVHD. A total of 62 SNP and 6 CNV assays were evaluable after removing the variants which were homozygous in (nearly) all samples. For sirolimus, rs2032582 (ABCB1) T-carriers versus non-T-carriers were associated with higher blood levels (p=0.01), with similar results for C/D ratio. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis supported these findings. For tacrolimus, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were associated with higher blood levels than CYP3A5*1/*1 (p=0.002). By multivariable analysis, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were independently associated with decreased acute GVHD compared to CYP3A5*1/*1, after adjustment for conditioning, donor type, race/ethnicity and age. We demonstrated association of specific ADME genetic polymorphisms with blood levels of tacrolimus/sirolimus, and incidence of acute GVHD post-HCT, in spite of TDM and dose adjustment. A larger ongoing study will determine whether these associations have clinical utility beyond TDM.

## Introduction

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an effective and potentially curative therapy for a variety of malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases [[1](#R1)]; however graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major complication, and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality post-transplantation [[2](#R2)]. We, and others, have evaluated the combination of two immunosuppressive drugs, tacrolimus and sirolimus, as a GVHD prophylactic regimen, demonstrating that the combination is associated with reduced incidence/severity of acute GVHD and transplant-related mortality [[3](#R3)–[6](#R6)]. A randomized phase III trial, conducted by the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), compares tacrolimus/methotrexate versus tacrolimus/sirolimus as GVHD prophylaxis after matched related donor transplantation using a total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen [[7](#R7)]. No significant differences are seen in grade 2–4 acute GVHD-free survival, disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) between the two arms. However, patients treated with tacrolimus/sirolimus are found to have statistically significantly faster engraftment and lower incidence of oral mucositis. Although not statistically significant, there is also a trend toward higher incidence of chronic GVHD and more endothelial damage, including thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), in the tacrolimus/sirolimus arm compared to tacrolimus/methotrexate (p=0.06). The paper suggests that careful monitoring of sirolimus blood levels could mitigate the increased risk of endothelial damage [[7](#R7)].

There are a wide range of toxicities associated with the combination of tacrolimus and sirolimus including renal impairment, neurotoxicity and TMA. The reported incidence of TMA ranges from 13–20% [[3](#R3), [5](#R5)]. We demonstrated in a recent retrospective analysis that higher sirolimus levels were associated with higher incidence of TMA [[8](#R8)]. Sirolimus has also been found to be associated with myelosuppression and increased triglycerides at higher doses or blood concentrations [[9](#R9), [10](#R10)]. Due to the narrow therapeutic indices of tacrolimus and sirolimus and their associated toxicities, a better understanding of factors influencing drug levels might allow more efficient prevention of GVHD with fewer side effects ([Figure 1](#F1)).

GVHD, graft-versus-host disease; TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy.

Tacrolimus distributes from plasma to red blood cells rapidly, with a half-life of approximately 12 hours [[11](#R11)], and is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system [[12](#R12)], including CYP3A5 [[13](#R13)], CYP3A4 [[14](#R14)], CYP2E1 [[15](#R15)], CYP2A6 [[15](#R15)] and CYP2D6 [[16](#R16)]. In addition other enzymes affect tacrolimus metabolism, such as UGT2B7 [[17](#R17)] and P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1) [[18](#R18)]. Sirolimus has a half-life of approximately 60 hours and is primarily metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system (CYP3A5 and CYP3A4) [[10](#R10)], with additional metabolic effects by P-glycoprotein [[19](#R19)], SLCO1B1-OATP1B1 and SLCO1B3-OATP1B3 [[20](#R20)].

Allelic variants of genes implicated in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) can determine the pharmacokinetic variability of many medications and have been increasingly recognized as important factors determining the success or failure of medical treatments. Only limited numbers of ADME variants have been studied for immunosuppressive medications in solid organ transplant, and to date there is a scarcity of data in HCT. For example, cytochrome P450IIIA (CYP3A), encoded by the *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* genes, and P-glycoprotein, encoded by the *ABCB1* gene (also known as multidrug resistance gene 1 or *MDR1*), are known to play key roles in the biotransformation and transportation of tacrolimus, cyclosporine and sirolimus [[8](#R8), [21](#R21), [22](#R22)]. The level of functionality of the human CYP3A enzyme is determined by genomic allelic variants. For example, people with at least one wild-type *CYP3A5*1* allele synthesize a functional protein that constitutes up to 50% of the total hepatic CYP3A. These individuals are functional CYP3A5 expressers in contrast to *CYP3A5*3* homozygotes, who express low levels of CYP3A5 (non-expressers) [[24](#R24)].

To date there are no published data describing the impact of ADME allelic variants on the combination of tacrolimus and sirolimus in the setting of HCT. The *primary objective* of this study was to examine the possible influence of ADME variants on tacrolimus and sirolimus blood levels in patients who received allogeneic HCT from related or unrelated donors. Based on our published tacrolimus/sirolimus experience in a phase II trial and retrospective analyses using both matched related and unrelated donors [[5](#R5), [8](#R8), [30](#R30)–[32](#R32)], we determined that the impact of ADME genotype on blood levels would be most apparent in the early post-HCT period, before dosing of tacrolimus/sirolimus was adjusted by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Secondary analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between ADME allelic variants and clinical HCT outcomes: acute GHVD, TMA, and renal function.

## Patients and methods

### Patient and Treatment Characteristics

From January 2005 to August 2007, a consecutive case-series of 177 patients underwent allogeneic HCT at City of Hope using a tacrolimus/sirolimus-based GVHD prophylactic regimen and hematopoietic stem cells from either a matched related donor (MRD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD). Archived DNA samples from patient blood samples were retrieved for these patients under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol that also allowed use of clinical data [[8](#R8)]. All 177 patients had samples available for genotyping; of these, 173 had high quality data for analysis. Patient, disease and treatment characteristics are shown in [Table 1](#T1).

Table 1 Caption: Summary of Patient, Disease, Transplant Characteristics (n=173)

Blood levels of tacrolimus and sirolimus were recorded for all patients on average twice weekly for the first 100 days post-transplant. Tacrolimus and sirolimus total blood levels were obtained using Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) methodology.

Conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine/melphalan (n=103, 59.5%), fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI)/cyclophosphamide (n=9, 5.2%), FTBI/etoposide (n=46, 26.6%) and busulfan/cyclophosphamide (n=15, 8.7%). GVHD prophylaxis was administered according to published reports^[3, 5]^ as follows: sirolimus 12 mg by mouth on day −3 (loading dose), followed by 4 mg orally per day, with subsequent dose adjustments to maintain blood levels between 3–12 ng/ml. Tacrolimus was initially dosed at 0.02 mg/kg intravenously per day, starting on day −3, then switched to an equivalent oral dose when oral intake was adequate after engraftment and prior to hospital discharge (~3–4 weeks post HCT), to maintain target blood levels of 5–10 ng/ml. Tacro and Siro were given for at least 6 months after transplant unless there was a toxicity warranting discontinuation before that time. For MUD HCT, additional methotrexate was administered at a dose of 5mg/m^2^ on days +1, +3, and +6. One patient undergoing MUD-HCT also received antithymocyte globulin at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on day −3, 1.5 mg/kg on day −2 and 2.5 mg/kg on day −1. Antifungal prophylaxis consisted of low-dose lipid complex amphotericin B (Abelcet; 1 mg/kg), caspofungin, or micafungin starting on day 0 or day +1.

### Genotyping methodology

Archived DNA samples from patient blood were genotyped on the MassARRAY Comapct Analyzer platform (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA) utilizing the iPLEX® ADME PGx Panel. This panel centered on the PharmADME working group list [[33](#R33)] and covers >99% of the PharmaADME working group core list. The panel interrogates 188 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and 12 copy number variant (CNV) assays in 36 pharmacogenetically relevant genes ([Table S1](#SD1)).

For each sample, a total of 80 ng of genomic DNA was PCR amplified in 8 multiplex reactions (200 assays total) using iPLEX® Gold chemistry to generate target fragments. These PCR products were subsequently treated with SAP enzyme to dephosphorylate fragments and neutralize dNTPs. An extension primer was then annealed to each fragment and a single base extension reaction performed using proprietary mass modified dNTPs. Extension products were then treated with cation-exchange Clean Resin to remove any remaining ions (e.g. Na+) prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Approximately 40 nL of each multiplex reaction product was spotted onto a SpectroCHIP II matrix pad and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Genotype calls were examined in Typer Analyzer v4.0.22.67 prior to haplotype and CNV analysis report generation with Admet v1.0.7 (R-script code embedded within Typer Analyzer for ADME allelic variants). This high throughput platform is capable of analyzing 48 patient samples, for 200 independent genotypes, in approximately 72 minutes. Genotype data generated on the Sequenom MassARRAY platform for this submission was analyzed with vendor provided software (ADME PGx Software v1.0.) to generate haplotype data. These haplotypes were reviewed by the vendor (Sequenom) for test accuracy and performance. All anonymized data was securely stored on a password protected server.

### Study endpoints

#### Drug endpoints

Tacrolimus and sirolimus blood levels were measured at least weekly (averaging twice weekly) until day 100 per standard of care monitoring, with dose adjustments made for target levels and/or clinical toxicity. Drug level analyses for this study were performed using the calculated median values for tacrolimus/sirolimus blood levels in ng/mL and blood concentration/dose ratios (C/D ratios) over set early time periods during the inpatient stay, 7 and 14 days post-HCT for each patient, to limit the possible effects of dose adjustment by the treating physician. The tacrolimus levels endpoint includes the period through 7 days post-HCT, while for sirolimus levels the endpoint includes through 14 days, due to the longer half-life of sirolimus. C/D ratios were calculated as blood concentration in ng/mL divided by total daily dose in mg.

#### Clinical endpoints

Acute GVHD was defined and staged according to Glucksberg *et al.* [[34](#R34)]. Effects on renal function were assessed by evaluating the fold-change in creatinine level from baseline (day −4) to maximum level through day +7 and day +14. TMA was assessed based on the following diagnostic criteria: serum creatinine (sCr) increase of ≥ 50% above baseline, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 2x upper normal limit, the presence of schistocytes or persistent presence of nucleated RBCs, and prolonged or progressive thrombocytopenia (<50 × 10^9^/L or ≥ 50% decrease) [[8](#R8)].

### Statistical methodology

The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare medians between groups. Potential associations between gene polymorphisms and repeatedly measured levels of sirolimus/tacrolimus over time were assessed using the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach [[35](#R35), [36](#R36)], quasi-likelihood to estimate model parameters; correlations were treated as nuisance parameters. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (grades II-IV) and hazard ratio were estimated after taking into account the competing risk of early death or relapse. Similarly the cumulative incidence of TMA was estimated after accounting for the competing risk of death and relapse. For a given gene polymorphism, possible differences between cumulative incidence curves in the presence of a competing risk were tested using the Gray method [[37](#R37)]. The impact of patient and treatment features, including: SNP/CNV, age at transplant (<median: 46.8 years vs. ≥46.8), self-reported race/ethnicity (Asian, Hispanic, Other, White), donor type (MRD versus MUD), and conditioning regimen (myeloablative vs. reduced intensity) on acute GVHD risk and on TMA risk was assessed using the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis competing risks analogue of Fine-Gray [[38](#R38)]. All calculations were performed using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R (version 3.1.1; [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org)). *P*-values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons due to the exploratory nature of the study. Note: All evaluable variants for ‘genes of interest’ are reported in the data tables; only evaluable ‘additional genes’ with p-values of ≤0.05 are reported.

## Results

### Assay performance

#### Sample evaluability

The patient DNA samples for patients on a previous study [[8](#R8)] were retrieved from the HLA specimen repository. 177 patient samples were genotyped; 173 showed high quality data. The average call rate for these samples was 98.85% over the 200 assays, with a median call rate of 100%.

#### SNP/CNV evaluability

Of the 200 SNP or CNV assays, 88 were homozygous for all genotyped samples, 42 were nearly homozygous, and 5 had at least 10% missing data, leaving 62 SNP and 6 CNV assays (68 polymorphisms) that we considered evaluable for analysis of tacrolimus/sirolimus metabolism ([Table S1](#SD1)). Based on published data in the solid organ transplantation literature, three ADME genes are primarily implicated in tacrolimus and sirolimus pharmacogenetics: *ABCB1, CYP3A4,* and *CYP3A5.* For our study, evaluable polymorphisms in these three *genes of interest*, as they are labeled in the data tables, included 6 variants altogether: *ABCB1* (*rs1045642*, *rs1128503*, *rs2032582*, *rs32113619*), *CYP3A4* (*rs35599367*), and *CYP3A5* (*rs776746*); for these 6 SNPs, all data are shown for each analysis. In the 62 remaining polymorphisms, labeled as *additional genes* in data tables, we also explored potential ADME associations in the context of combined tacrolimus and sirolimus for HCT; however only variants/assays with p-values ≤0.05 are included in the data tables.

### ADME pharmacogenetic associations with sirolimus/tacrolimus blood levels

#### Sirolimus analysis

The results of Kruskal-Wallis comparisons for associations between ADME genetic variants and median sirolimus blood levels and C/D ratios through day 14 post-transplantation are summarized in [Table 2](#T2). The median number of blood samples tested for all patients was 3 (range 1–7) and there were no differences in median number of samples between different ADME variants. Among all evaluable ADME assays, the SNP *rs2032582* of the *ABCB1* gene of interest, which codes for the PgP/MDR1 drug transporter, was most associated with sirolimus levels. Patients who were T-carriers at *rs2032582*, i.e. either homozygous for T or heterozygous with one T allele, experienced higher median drug levels of 8.3 ng/ml (range: 2.8–18.7) versus 6.9 ng/ml (range: 2.1–13.1) for the non T-carriers (p=0.01,); results were similar for C/D ratio (P=0.05). Data from seven additional genes are also shown in [Table 2](#T2) for variants with a p-value ≤0.05 for either blood levels or C/D ratios; however none of them had p ≤ 0.05 for both blood and C/D ratios.

#### Tacrolimus analysis

Similarly, we observed differences in tacrolimus levels in the first 7 days after transplant based on ADME genotypic variant. Median tacrolimus blood levels and C/D ratios are summarized in [Table 3](#T3) by ADME genotype. The median number of blood samples tested for all patients was 2 (range 1–6) and there were no differences in median number of samples between different ADME variants. Among all evaluable ADME assays, the SNP *rs776746* of the *CYP3A5* gene of interest, was most associated with tacrolimus levels. Homozygous G-carriers *(CYP3A5*3/*3)* experienced higher median drug levels of 11.0 (range: 3.1–27.0) versus 9.4 (range: 3.9–16.2) for GA *(CYP3A5*3/*1)* and 9.3 (range: 5.0–16.8) for AA *(CYP3A5*1/*1)* carriers (p=0.002,). Similar findings were observed for C/D ratios (p=0.01). Additional gene variants that may be associated with tacrolimus for both blood level and C/D ratio include *CYP2E1* (SNP *rs2070673*) and *UGT2B17* (CNV assays *UGT2B17E1 and UGT2B17E3*) ([Table 3](#T3)).

#### Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis

Using time as a continuous variable and each of the SNPs as a covariate, GEE repeated measurement analysis was carried out for sirolimus and tacrolimus blood levels. For sirolimus, [Table S1](#SD1) shows all variants for the 3 genes of interest and additional genes where p ≤ 0.05 for the group coefficient. Consistent with our results for median sirolimus levels at day 14 ([Table 2](#T2)), *rs2032582* (*ABCB1*) T-carriers (GT, TT, TA) show increasing sirolimus levels over time relative to non-T-carriers (group coefficient 1.06; p=0.018) ([Table S2](#SD1)). A smoothed-scatter plot aids in visualizing these changes in blood level over time ([Figure 2A](#F2)). T carriers (GT, TT, TA – red line), had on average a 1.06 ng/ml increase in the sirolimus blood level compared to the reference group (AA, GG, GA – black line).

Repeated drug level measurements over time were plotted for individual patients and a Loess smoothed curve was fitted. (A) depicts the association of ABCB1 rs2032582 on sirolimus drug levels over time after infusion of stem cells at allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Red lines indicate T-carrier variants (TT, TA, GT) and black lines indicate non-T carriers (AA, GG, GA). (B). depicts the association of CYP3A5 rs776746 on tacrolimus drug levels over time post alloHCT. Red lines are GG variants, blue are GA, and black are AA.

For tacrolimus, [Table S3](#SD1) shows all data for genes of interest and additional gene variants for which group coefficients have a p ≤ 0.05 for association with changes in tacrolimus levels over time. Based on results of the tacrolimus levels analysis ([Table 3](#T3)), we plotted the *rs776746 (CYP3A5)* and tacrolimus blood levels over time ([Figure 2B](#F2)). Using the AA (black) group as the reference group, subjects in the GG group (red) had on average a 1.44 ng/ml increase in tacrolimus levels (p=0.11). In comparison, subjects in the GA group (blue) had on average a 0.47 increase in tacrolimus levels (p=0.61).

### Assessment of Association with Clinical Outcomes

#### aGVHD outcomes

We analyzed all evaluable polymorphisms for association with acute GVHD. We found that the SNP *rs776746 (CYP3A5*1/*1)* AA variant was associated with increased incidence of acute GVHD (p=0.04); however due to the fact that only 8 patients expressed this gene variant, the confidence limits associated with this estimate are large ([Figure 2](#F2) and [Table 4](#T4)). We then constructed a multivariable model evaluating the possible association of *rs776746* (*CYP3A5*) with acute GVHD, after adjustment for patient age, allogeneic donor type, race/ethnicity, and conditioning intensity. Results showed that patients who had reduced intensity conditioning or carried *rs776746* (*CYP3A5*) GG and GA variants had a decreased hazard of developing acute GVHD ([Table 5](#T5)); donor type, patient age and race/ethnicity were not found to be siginificantly associated with acute GVHD risk. Among additional genes from the ADME PGx Panel, 2 SNPs also showed possible associations with acute GVHD: *CYP2C19* (*rs12248560*), and *VKORC1* (*rs7294*).

#### Renal function outcomes

We analyzed all evaluable polymorphisms for association with changes in renal function based on increased creatinine at days 7 and 14 post-HCT. None of the polymorphisms for the 3 genes of interest gave indications of association with increased serum creatinine levels ([Table S4](#SD1)). Among additional genes in the ADME PGx Panel, 6 gene polymorphisms trended toward association (p≤0.05) with either day 7 or day 14 increased creatinine levels, with *NAT2* (*rs1799931)* attaining p<0.01 over the first 7 days and p=0.02 over the first 14 days post-transplantation. All observed increased creatinine levels were 1.4-fold or less.

#### TMA outcomes

We analyzed all evaluable polymorphisms for association with cumulative incidence of TMA post-HCT. None of the polymorphisms for the 3 genes of interest gave indications of association with TMA incidence ([Table S5](#SD1)). In the additional genes from the ADME PGx Panel, 6 variants in 4 genes trended toward association with TMA (p≤0.05), including 3 SNPs from the *NAT2 gene, rs1041983* (p= 0.03), *rs1799930* (p= 0.02), and *rs1799931* (p <0.01).

#### Other clinical outcomes

We also evaluated the impact of ADME genetic variants on 100-day non-relapse mortality; however none of the three genes of interest showed an association.

## Discussion

Possible associations between abnormal drug reactions and individual inherited factors were first noted in the early 20^th^. Century; however, the term “pharmacogenetics” was coined by the German physician Friedrich Vogel in 1959 [[39](#R39)]. Since then the field of pharmacogenetics has evolved and numerous reports have been published on the influence of specific SNPs on multiple medications across medical disciplines. These reports have prompted the FDA to revise drug labels to include relevant pharmacogenetic information and recommendations for certain drugs like clopidogrel and warfarin [[40](#R40)]. Despite the advances in this field we are still in an exploratory era, with many influential genetic variants still to be uncovered.

The use of immunosuppressive therapy is essential to HCT to prevent potentially lethal GVHD reactions. Our institution and others utilize the combination of tacrolimus and sirolimus for GVHD prophylaxis. Vigilant monitoring of target blood levels is necessary to avoid adverse reactions and provide adequate immunosuppression, due to the narrow therapeutic ranges of both tacrolimus and sirolimus. Pharmacogenetic association studies can help us to predict target doses of these medications and assist clinicians in optimizing patient management. The association between the ADME genotype and immunosuppressant blood concentration is illustrated in solid organ transplantation by multiple reports. For instance Zhang *et al.* report that patients with *CYP3A5*1/*1* and **1/*3* have lower dose-adjusted tacrolimus concentrations compared to patients with *CYP3A5 *3/**3, in patients undergoing kidney transplantation [[25](#R25)]. Anglicheau and colleagues describe a similar effect of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphysims on the bioavailability of sirolimus [[26](#R26)]. These genomic variations can also impact the clinical outcome in renal transplantation. Patients who are *CYP3A5*3* expressers show a reduced incidence of acute rejection [[27](#R27)], and longer time to first rejection episode [[28](#R28)]. On the other hand, patients who are *CYP3A5*3* homozygotes have higher nephrotoxicity: 47% compared to 17% in patients who carried at least one *CYP3A5*1* allele [[29](#R29)].

In contrast studies in HCT are scarce due to the complexity of the conditioning regimens and GVHD regimens, and the many drug-drug interactions. Not only are patients recovering from myeloablative chemotherapy, but they are on a host of supportive care medications, such as anti-fungal drugs that may affect immunosuppressant drug levels. Despite the difficulty in obtaining clear cut results in this setting, we believe that this analysis will spark interest in future studies examining the role of ADME in HCT regimens and possible pharmacogenetic associations with transplant outcomes.

To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the use of a comprehensive ADME panel in the setting of HCT. This study used the iPLEX® ADME PGx Panel allowing us to economically explore a large number of polymorphisms in a relatively short period of time. We focused our analyses on the early post-transplant period, specifically the first 7 days days post-transplantation for tacrolimus and the first 14 days for sirolimus due to its longer half-life, because we expected a greater impact from ADME genetic variants before physician therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) had stabilized tacrolimus/sirolimus blood levels. Although a relatively small number of samples were used in this study, we were able to identify multiple SNPs that could potentially influence the blood levels of tacrolimus and sirolimus.

Our study confirms the influence of *rs776746 (CYP3A5*3)* on tacrolimus blood levels in the post-HCT setting. *rs776746* (*CYP3A5*3*/**3*) GG is a common polymorphism of *CYP3A5* leading to a pre-mRNA splicing site alteration, which in turn leads to a nonfunctional enzyme that decreases the metabolism of substrate drugs including tacrolimus, resulting in increased drug blood levels. In other words patients with haplotype *CYP3A5*3* (non-expressors) tend to have higher blood levels of tacrolimus at the same drug dose compared to those who express the *CYP3A5*1* (wild-type) allele. This polymorphism is present in about 70% of the Caucasian population while it accounts for 27–50% of *CYP3A5* alleles in African Americans, 65–85% in Asians and 75% in Mexican populations [[41](#R41)]. Although our sample population has low African American and Asian representation, we were able to demonstrate an association in our population mix. This result is corroborated by reports published in solid organ transplantation [[27](#R27)–[29](#R29), [42](#R42)]. Association of the *rs776746* polymorphism with tacrolimus at 7 days post-HCT, was seen at a significance level of p = 0.002. This trend was maintained when we analyzed the C/D ratio to account for TDM and dose modification by the treating physician (p = 0.01). Additional polymorphisms in the ADME panel such as 2 CNV assays from the *UGT2B17* gene, exhibited possible associations with tacrolimus blood levels that will be evaluated further in future studies.

In comparison to tacrolimus we did not find a significant difference in sirolimus blood levels associated with the *rs776746 (CYP3A5)* in the first 14 days post-HCT. Although some reports from solid organ transplantation indicate that there is an influence of *CYP3A5* on the sirolimus blood level [[43](#R43), [44](#R44)], these studies were conducted in the absence of tacrolimus. In a study by Anglicheau et al., the association of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 with sirolimus levels was eliminated when sirolimus was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor [[26](#R26)], which may explain our results. On the other hand, we observed a possible association in the blood levels of sirolimus in relation to *rs2032582 (ABCB1)* (p = 0.01) at 14 days post-HCT, with a similar trend toward association of C/D ratio (p = 0.05). In the additional polymorphisms from the ADME panel, several variants were associated with either sirolimus blood levels or C/D ratio, but none gave a signal for both blood levels and C/D ratio.

Genetic polymorphisms in ADME genes may not only impact drug levels, but can also impact clinical outcomes due to enhanced or reduced pharmacologic efficacy/toxicity of any given drug. In fact we found that that the *CYP3A5*1/*1* (*rs776746*, AA) associated with lower tacrolimus blood levels was also associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD (p=0.04). However this association is based on only 8 patients in the AA group, and while it is consistent with results from the solid organ transplant literature, it could be an artifact of the small sample size. In a previous study we reported a significant association between day 14 sirolimus drug levels and risk of TMA [[8](#R8)]; however, this analysis did not find any association between ADME genetic polymorphisms and TMA. This is likely due to the relatively small sample size and other clinical variables influencing sirolimus drug levels.

In conclusion, our study indicates a statistically significant association of specific ADME genetic polymorphisms with elevated blood levels of tacrolimus and sirolimus when used in combination as GVHD prophylaxis, in spite of vigilant TDM and dose adjustment. We also demonstrated an association between ADME genetic polymorphisms and a post-HCT clinical outcome, acute GVHD. Whether these associations are clinically meaningful in light of mitigating TDM is unclear. We have undertaken a larger confirmatory study to determine whether there is clinical utility for ADME-based personalized dosing of immunosuppressive medications in HCT recipients.
