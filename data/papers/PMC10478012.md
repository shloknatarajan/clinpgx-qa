## Abstract

Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with a narrow therapeutic range and is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium published evidence-based guidelines for CYP3A5 normal/intermediate metabolizers prescribed tacrolimus, yet few transplant centers have implemented routine testing. The objective of this study was to implement preemptive CYP3A genotyping into clinical practice in a large kidney transplant program and to evaluate workflow feasibility, potential clinical benefit, and reimbursement to identify barriers and determine sustainability. Preemptive pharmacogenetic testing for CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 was implemented in all patients listed for a kidney transplant as part of standard clinical care. Genotyping was performed at the listing appointment, results were reported as discrete data in the electronic medical record, and education and clinical decision support alerts were developed to provide pharmacogenetic-recommended tacrolimus dosing. During this initial phase, all patients were administered standard tacrolimus dosing, and clinical and reimbursement outcomes were collected. Greater than 99.5% of genotyping claims were reimbursed by third-party payers. CYP3A5 normal/intermediate metabolizers had significantly fewer tacrolimus trough concentrations within the target range and a significantly longer time to their first therapeutic trough compared to poor metabolizers. The challenge of tacrolimus dosing is magnified in the African American population. The US Food and Drug Administration drug label recommends increased starting doses in African ancestry, yet only ≈66% of African Americans in our cohort were normal/intermediate metabolizers who required higher doses. Routine CYP3A5 genotyping may overcome this issue by using genotype over race as a more accurate predictor of drug response.

## Methods

### Study Population

Preemptive pharmacogenetic testing for *CYP3A5* and *CYP3A4* was implemented in September 2020 for all patients listed for kidney transplant as part of standard clinical care. The initial implementation phase reported was from September 2020 to January 2022. Transplant listing appointments can occur months to years before the time of transplant; therefore, a substantial delay is expected from the initiation of routine genotyping until the time when all transplant recipients would have genotyping results available at the time of transplant.^10^ We chose to genotype at the pretransplant listing appointment to assure that we would have data available at the time of transplant; however, we had to accept the trade-off that <1 in 5 subjects genotyped would receive a transplant within the year. This study was granted an exemption by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board.

### Clinical Genotyping and Reporting to the Electronic Medical Record

Genotyping was performed at the listing appointment or, if not done at the time of listing, the annual evaluation appointment before transplant. Clinical pharmacogenetic analysis was performed on whole blood at the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified, College of American Pathologists–accredited Indiana University Pharmacogenomics Laboratory using a validated custom-designed OpenArray platform (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms included on the OpenArray platform included CYP3A4*2 (rs55785340), CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367), CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), CYP3A5*6 (rs10264272), and CYP3A5*7 (rs41303343).^11^ Star alleles were assigned metabolizer categories according to CPIC guidelines.^8^ Results were reported as discrete data including star allele and metabolizer category and deposited into the electronic medical record (EMR). It is imperative that results are reported as discrete data to ensure the capability to design clinical decision support (CDS) alerts that would fire on the basis of genotyping results. CDS alerts were developed to provide pharmacogenetic-recommended tacrolimus dosing. After the initial pilot of CDS alerts, providers were solicited for feedback about the alerts.

### Provider and Patient Education

Provider education was provided in both live lecture and written email formats. The clinical pharmacology implementation team presented the implementation plan at a regularly scheduled kidney transplant group meeting to inform the providers of this implementation effort and explain how to interpret the results. This live-format oral presentation was followed up with an email summarizing the implementation effort. Patients receiving a transplant were provided a brochure at the time of testing, and results were sent via the US Postal Service with a letter explaining the results and a punchout wallet card containing the patient’s genotype and a phone number to contact with questions.

### Implementation Feasibility Study

Before adjusting the institutional tacrolimus dosage protocol, the transplant service line sought to assess the workflow, reimbursement, and clinical benefit within their recipients during an ≈1-year initial phase. A retrospective study of kidney transplant recipients was conducted with clinical and demographic data gathered from the EMR. All patients received our institutional protocolized tacrolimus dosing consisting of 2 mg orally twice daily with dose adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring to achieve a goal trough concentration (7–9 ng/mL), which is representative of standard dosing for CYP3A5 poor metabolizers. Tacrolimus trough concentrations were drawn prior to the morning tacrolimus dose and quantified via chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay using standard clinical procedures. For inpatients, the timing of the evening dose was verified by the EMR; however, for outpatient doses, the exact timing of the evening dose could not be verified. Per the tacrolimus administration protocol, concomitant therapy with CYP3A inhibitor medications was avoided. To assess the clinical benefit of genotype-guided tacrolimus dosing in our population, it was important to not immediately deviate from the long-standing standardized dosing protocol. Instead, the standard protocol was followed, and clinical outcomes, including the time to first therapeutic trough concentration, the percentage of trough concentrations in the therapeutic range, and the incidence of organ rejection or death, were retrospectively evaluated and correlated with genotype.^2,8^

### Reimbursement

A key metric for implementation success was sustainability. Reimbursement was tracked through the health center for patients receiving a transplant who underwent *CYP3A5* and *CYP3A4* genotyping at the transplant listing appointment or annual pretransplant evaluation.

## Results

### Implementation

Between September 2020 and December 2021, 560 patients were genotyped ([Figure 1](#F1)), of which 103 (39 normal/intermediate and 64 poor metabolizers) underwent kidney transplantation. An illustration of the implementation process was created with [BioRender.com](https://BioRender.com) ([Figure 2](#F2)).^12^

Summary genotype results for listed patients receiving a kidney transplant. Five hundred sixty individuals were genotyped for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. CYP, cytochrome P450.

### Clinical Decision Support

Genotype data were available to clinicians at the time of transplant, and CDS alerts recommending a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the tacrolimus starting dose fired when tacrolimus was ordered for patients who were CYP3A5 normal or intermediate metabolizers ([Figure 3](#F3)). In this initial pilot phase, providers were instructed to not follow the dosing recommendations but to instead provide feedback regarding their understanding and acceptability of the alerts. Based on provider feedback that the alerts were firing too frequently, the following modification was made in an effort to minimize alert fatigue: Alerts were suppressed for 2 years after firing once per patient for each provider. Dosing recommendations contained in CDS alerts were based on weight and *CYP3A5* genotype. CYP3A4 poor metabolizers are rare, and this genotype was included in the panel to help explain outliers.

### Clinical Study Data

Baseline demographics and genotyping data are presented in [Table 1](#T1). Race and ethnicity were collected as patient reported and not genetically validated. Normal/intermediate metabolizers had 33% and poor metabolizers had 42% of tacrolimus trough concentrations within the desired range of 7–9 ng/mL in the 14 days following transplant (*P* < .01; [Figure 4](#F4)). The time to therapeutic tacrolimus trough concentrations was 6.6 ± 0.6 days for normal/intermediate metabolizers and 3.6 ± 0.3 days for poor metabolizers (*P* < .01; [Figure 5](#F5)). All tacrolimus trough concentrations for all patients in the first 7 and 21 days following transplant are shown in scatterplots ([Figures S1](#SD1) and [S2](#SD1)). Although our study was not adequately powered to assess transplant outcomes, we observed a trend toward an increase in a composite outcome assessing transplant rejection or all-cause mortality within the first year of transplant based on CYP3A5 expresser status (rate of rejection/death was 28.2% in CYP3A5 expressers versus 14.1% in nonexpressers; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; *P* = .12). Self-reported Black race (OR, 2.7; *P* = .09) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 5.1; *P* = .08) also trended toward an increase in rejection/death. Detailed clinical data are provided in [Table S1](#SD1).

### Reimbursement

Reimbursement was tracked for all 560 individuals, and genotyping claims were denied by payers in <0.5% of patients. The pharmacogenomics laboratory provided *CYP3A5* genotyping under the current procedural terminology code 81231. In December 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revised their policies to provide coverage for pharmacogenetic testing for drugs included in CPIC guidelines, including tacrolimus. The average Medicare reimbursement for *CYP3A4 and CYP3A5* genotyping was US$174.81.

## Discussion

We report the initial phase of implementation and reimbursement of *CYP3A* genotyping in our kidney transplant program. All potential kidney transplant recipients are now genotyped as part of standard clinical care. To our knowledge, this is the first report of clinical implementation of *CYP3A* genotyping in a kidney transplant program outside of a clinical trial. Our results reinforce that *CYP3A5* genotype is an important predictor of therapeutic tacrolimus trough concentrations, which should be included in dosing decisions along with factors such as delayed graft function or altered gastrointestinal absorption and concomitant immunosuppression medications. Achieving target concentrations is important to reduce organ rejection and hospital length of stay.^2,8,13^ Tacrolimus dosing challenges are common in the African American population.^8^ The US Food and Drug Administration drug label recommends higher starting doses in individuals of African ancestry, but only 70% of African Americans are normal/intermediate metabolizers. CYP3A5 normal/intermediate metabolizers are also found among Whites and Asians (East Asian and Central/South Asian) at lower frequencies (14% and 44%–55%, respectively). Self-reported African American race is more closely associated with CYP3A5 expresser status than other self-reported race categories, but self-reported race is not an accurate surrogate for genotype. Equality and minimization of bias in health care have recently become prioritized by health care systems as recognition of racial bias has come to the forefront in many non–health care aspects of society. Unfortunately, race is a strong predictor of poor health care outcomes, including a higher risk of chronic kidney disease and poorer kidney transplant outcomes in Blacks and African Americans.^14–16^ In recent commentaries in both lay and medical literature, authors weigh in on the impact of race, disparities, and kidney disease.^17,18^ One-dose standard protocols and using race as a surrogate for genotype can both potentiate racial disparities in tacrolimus dosing. Routine *CYP3A5* genotyping is a more accurate predictor of drug response than race alone and deemphasizes race as a biological variable in clinical care.^2^ This approach aligns with recommendations of the American Society of Nephrology to remove race from glomerular filtration rate calculations.^18^

Even though our study was not powered to evaluate clinical outcomes, we report a significant association of *CYP3A5* genotype on the time to first therapeutic tacrolimus trough concentration. This finding is important as past investigations have identified the time to therapeutic tacrolimus trough concentrations as a predictor of event-free survival 1-year after transplant.^2,13^ Relatedly, we also observed a 2-fold increase in the incidence of transplant rejection/all-cause mortality based on *CYP3A5* genotype, though this difference did not reach statistical significance. Although under-powered, our study adds to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the impact of race, ethnicity, and *CYP3A5* genotype on tacrolimus concentrations and kidney transplant outcomes. While race and ethnicity (and the social determinants of health that they reflect) are established risk factors for poor transplant outcomes, they are not modifiable; in contrast, *CYP3A5* genotype can be used to guide initial tacrolimus dosing to improve kidney transplant outcomes, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities.

Although the association between *CYP3A5* and tacrolimus is well established,^2^ multiple barriers to clinical implementation persist. These barriers are so substantial that despite the CPIC guidelines being published over a decade ago, *CYP3A5* genotyping is not standard of care for kidney transplant centers. Our multidisciplinary team took many steps to break down these barriers to implement genotyping as standard of care for all patients receiving a kidney transplant. To overcome the delay between ordering and EMR reporting, genotyping was ordered in pretransplant appointments. To facilitate recall of results by clinicians, sometimes months after reporting, CDS alerts were developed to advise prescribers. Frequently, the largest barrier is reimbursement. Within our reimbursement structure, <0.5% of claims were denied. In our own institution, patients received standard tacrolimus dosing during the initial implementation phase because the transplant service line wanted these challenges addressed before altering institutional protocols to include genotype-guided tacrolimus dosing. Overcoming barriers required a collaborative effort between transplant surgery, nephrology, pharmacy, EMR support, the genotyping laboratory, and pharmacogenomic experts. We share our experience successfully implementing genotype-guided tacrolimus dosing to assist other clinicians in streamlining pharmacogenetic implementation at their institutions.
