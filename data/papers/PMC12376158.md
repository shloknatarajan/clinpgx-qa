## Abstract

**Objective:** 
To explore the allele frequency and associations between the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the ABCB1 (rs1045642) and CYP7A1 (rs3808607) genes on lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin among Malaysian male patients.

**Method:** 
The study included 64 subjects from a previous genetic association study among male patients who were on atorvastatin. The study was carried out at HUSM, Kelantan, Malaysia from December 2023 to October 2024. The patients were split into 2 groups, each consisting of 32 subjects such as controlled (LDL level <3 mmol/L) and uncontrolled (LDL level >3 mmol/L). After genotyping each participant, the influence on their lipid profile was determined.

**Results:** 
The genotype frequency of genes ABCB1 (rs1045642) and CYP7A1 (rs3808607) was higher in the variant allele GG (37.5%) and TT (36%), respectively, compared with the reference allele. Patients with the variant genotype of ABCB1 and reference genotype of CYP7A1 were more likely to be observed in the controlled group in response to atorvastatin. A significant correlation was found between the genotype ABCB1 (rs1045642) and HDL levels (p=0.045).

**Conclusion:** 
The allele frequency of the heterozygous group was higher in both studied SNPs. The variant allele of gene ABCB1 and the reference allele of CYP7A1 showed a more favorable lipid profile.

## Methods

From December 2023 to October 2024, a retrospective cross-sectional study was executed at Hospital Pakar Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. The biological samples utilized in the present research came from a prior study that investigated the genetic variations linked to erectile dysfunction and testosterone levels in males on statin therapy. All patients were aged between 34 and 59 and attended the Family Medicine Outpatient Clinic for regular follow-up for at least 3 months. Patients diagnosed with prostate diseases, cancers, and other sexual disorders were excluded.

All samples were stored and handled following standard protocols. In the previous study, 97 subjects who were on atorvastatin therapy were recruited. Among them, 34 had controlled lipid (LDL < 3 mmol/L), and 63 had uncontrolled lipid level (LDL > 3 mmol/L). For this study, an equal 1:1 ratio of patients was recruited. After excluding 2 patients with missing samples from the controlled lipid profile group, 32 patients from this group were included. Correspondingly, 32 patients were randomly selected from the 63 uncontrolled lipid profile group patients.

The Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, USM, was the site of genotyping experiment. With the approval number USM/JEPeM/21120825, the current study was granted permission by the Human Ethics Research Committee USM (HREC).

### The SNPs target information

In this study, the SNP of the *ABCB1* (rs1045642) and *CYP7A1* (rs3808607) genes were optimized. The DNA sequences encoding the SNPs were identified from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.

### Genotyping analysis

Ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) tubes were used for maintaining whole blood samples. The PrimeWay genomic DNA extraction kit (KIT-9020-50) was applied to carry out the genomic purification of DNA from blood samples.^19^ A spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was utilized to determine the concentration and quality (DNA fragment intactness) of extracted DNA prior to running on a 2% agarose gel. The isolated DNA was genotyped for *ABCB1* rs1045642 using real-time PCR (RT-PCR), whereas the second SNP, amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS PCR) was used for *CYP7A1* rs3808607. Sanger DNA sequencing technique was utilized to verify and validate the PCR results.

### Genotyping of gene CYP7A1 (rs3808607)

NCBI Primer Blast, designed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) USA, was applied to create 2 unique primer sets. The BLAST was used to determine the specificity and melting temperatures of the primers ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast)).

### Optimization steps of the tetra primer

To prevent unspecific bands on the electrophoresis gel, ARMS PCR was carried out by adjusting the annealing temperature and ratio of the outer and inner primers. These variables were resolved by employing a gradient PCR technique, which was optimized by utilizing varying outer and inner primer ratios and annealing temperatures. Following annealing temperature optimization, the ratios of primers, G0 Taq buffer, MgCl_2_, master, and primer mixture were prepared separately and added into the PCR tube with 2 µL of DNA (2 ng/µL). Total PCR mixture contained volume of 25 µL. DNA amplification was performed using the Bio-Rad T100 heat cycler.

Five minutes of cycle preparation at 95°C, thirty seconds of denaturation at 95°C, thirty seconds of annealing at 53°C (optimized temperature), one minute of polymerization at 72°C, and 5 min of final extension at 72°C constituted optimal PCR conditions. The PCR product (2 µL) and 2.5 µL of FloroSafe DNA dye were run on a 2% agarose gel for 55 min at 55 V against a 2 µL 100 bp DNA ladder. UV lamp was used to observe the gel.

### Genotyping of gene ABCB1 (rs1045642)

The gene was amplified and subjected to allelic discrimination via RT-PCR. TaqMan^®^ genotyping master mix (Applied Biosystems™) was optimized for SNP genotyping with TaqMan^®^ probes. It included AmpliTaq Gold^®^ DNA Polymerase Ultra-Pure (UP), dNTPs without dUTP, and optimized mix components. Each TaqMan MGB probe has a reporter dye at the 5´-end FAM dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) that was coupled to the 5´-end of the allele 1 probe (allele G). The VIC dye was attached to the 5´-end of the allele 2 probe, such as allele A. A non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) was affixed to the 3´-end of each probe.

Each PCR reaction tube contained a mixture of 2 µL of DNA extract (5 ng/µL), 12.5 µL of TaqMan PCR Master Mix, 9.25 µL of distilled water, and 1.25 µL of the 20× working stock of SNP Genotyping Assay. The sample tubes were mixed using a vortex before being spun down and placed in a thermal cycler. The first step in the AmpliTaq Gold PCR method was to activate the enzymes for 10 min (Hold) at 95°C. Then, 40 repetitions of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s were conducted for 1 minute of annealing at 60°C.

The results were appeared as peaks. Two peaks indicate heterozygous, and one peak indicates homozygous allele ([Figure 2](#f2)).

### Statistical analysis

The outcome variables were represented by the mean and standard deviation. The impact of both SNPs on LDL, HDL, and TG levels was measured during routine follow-up in patients taking atorvastatin for at least 3 months and analyzed using the Chi-squared test. A sample size calculation was performed using Quanto software, and the required sample size was 92. The relationship between polymorphisms and lipid-lowering responses was explored by using regression models. Data analysis was done by using SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). *P*<0.05 was chosen as the threshold for statistical significance.

## Results

The study comprised 64 participants taking atorvastatin (10–30 mg/day). [Table 1](#t1) summarizes the research population’s clinical and demographic characteristics.

### Allele frequency of the both studied genes

The chi-squared test was applied to ascertain whether the distribution of alleles was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE, [Table 2](#t2)). The *X*^2^ test and *p*-value analysis for both *ABCB1* (rs1045642) and *CYP7A1* (rs3808607) show no significant deviation from HWE, The *X*^2^ statistic for *ABCB1* of 0.78 and a *p*-value of 0.676 confirm that the observed genotype distribution aligns well with the expected values. Similarly, the *X*^2^ statistic for *CYP7A1* of 0.0 and a *p*-value of 1.0 show perfect agreement between observed and expected genotypes. These findings imply that there is no indication of population stratification, selection pressures, or genotyping mistakes influencing the population under study and that the genotype data for both genes are reliable.

### Genotypes and lipid-lowering response

The genotype *ABCB1* (rs1045642) and HDL level are significantly correlated (*p*=0.045, [Table 3](#t3)). Meanwhile, the means of HDL, LDL, and TG levels for *ABCB1* (rs1045642) showed that the LDL levels are slightly higher in individuals with the reference genotype AA (3.99±1.21) compared to those with the heterozygous genotype (3.13±1.36). The differences in LDL and TG levels and genotypes *ABCB1* (rs1045642) are not statistically significant.

### Table 3.

| Characteristic | Total (N=64) | Uncontrolled group (n=32), n (%) | Controlled group (n=32), n (%) | P-value*LDL | P-value*HDL | P-value* TG |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ABCB1 (rs1045642) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| AA (reference type) | 07 | 05 (15.6) | 02 (6.3) |   |   |   |
| AG (heterozygous) | 33 | 14 (43.8) | 19 (59.4) | 0.224 | 0.045 | 0.451 |

| TT (variant type) | 23 | 09 (28.1) | 14 (43.8) |   |   |   |

Table 3 Caption: - Effect of genetic polymorphism of both studied gene on LDL, HDL and TGs level.

When the means of HDL, LDL, and TG levels were compared, the HDL level of gene *CYP7A1* (rs3808607) showed a significant difference, much higher in the reference genotype GG (3.61±6.49) than in the heterozygous genotype (1.37±0.64, *p*=0.013, Figure 3). Meanwhile, the differences in LDL and TG levels between the genotypes are not statistically significant. A substantial correlation between hypertension and a greater probability of being a subject in the uncontrolled group was demonstrated by both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses ([Table 4](#t4)). However, the SNPs investigated exhibit no significant relationships with LDL and TG levels. Although the odds ratio of heterozygous genotype GT of *CYP7A1* (rs3808607) indicates a possible increase in the chances of the subject to have a controlled LDL level by 1.385 times, but the wide confidence interval and non-significant *p*-value limit the conclusiveness of this result.

## Discussion

The *ABCB1* transporter is the major mechanism by which atorvastatin and its metabolites are removed from the liver and transported to the bile.^15^ The *ABCB1* SNPs such as rs1128503 (1236C > T), rs2032582 (2677G > T/A), and rs1045642 (3435C>T) had a significant influence on the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and effectiveness of atorvastatin in reducing cholesterol.^21^ The *ABCB1* SNP that has been evaluated the most is C3435T (rs1045642) and several investigations have demonstrated that the genotype affects P-glycoprotein’s capacity to control statin absorption.^22^ The *ABCB1* gene (C3435T) polymorphism results in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) malfunction, which alters the pharmacokinetic characteristics of statins that influence their efficacy.^23,24^ Reduced *CYP7A1* expression may diminish LDL receptor function, resulting in decreased LDL-C catabolism.^25^ Numerous studies indicate a causal association between *CYP7A1* polymorphisms in *−204 A/C* (rs3808607) and reduced statin therapy response.^17-23^

The allele frequency and genetic effect of 2 SNPs (rs1045642 of the *ABCB1* gene and rs3808607 of *CYP7A1*) on the lipid profile were analyzed. The allele frequency of *ABCB1* (rs1045642) among the 64 subjects was 0.37 for allele A and 0.63 for allele G, which is comparable with the reference allele frequency according to the dbSNP database. It is also consistent with previous reports among Caucasians^26,27^ and in the Indian population, with the allele frequency of the reference and variant alleles of 0.39 and 0.61.^28^

For *ABCB1* (rs1045642), the observed genotype frequencies of the variant allele were higher than those of the reference allele, which are comparable with other literatures.^29-32^ In contrast, other studies revealed that the percentage of the reference allele is higher than the variant allele.^21,33,34^ This deviation in the current study can be due to different ethnicity and limited sample size.

The allele frequency of rs3808607 of *CYP7A1* among the 64 subjects was 0.40 for allele G and 0.60 for allele T, which is comparable with the reference allele frequency in the database of dbSNP. However, the allele frequency of this gene is contrary to the findings of Kajinami et al^29^ in the American population and Kadam’s study in the Indian population, where the allele frequency of the reference genotype was higher than the variant genotype.^28^ Therefore, allele frequency of the variant allele T prevails more than the reference allele G for the *CYP7A1* gene (rs3808607) in the Malaysians.

The observed genotype frequencies among the studied population of the reference allele GG, heterozygous allele GT, and variant allele TT of *CYP7A1* (rs3808607) were 15.6%, 48.4%, and 36%. It is comparable with the study of Kajinami et al. in America,^25^ Hubacek et al^36^ in England, and Wei et al^37^ in China, which recorded the heterozygous genotype as the highest genotype frequency and a higher reference genotype frequency than the variant one. On the contrary to the current findings, Oros et al^38^ did a research in Spanish people indicated that reference genotype had the highest percentage of genotype frequency compared to the variant and heterozygous genotype.

We agree that sample size of 64 is not enough for the results to be broadly applicable, which is the major limitation of the study. The findings show that the heterozygous/variant genotype AG/GG of *ABCB1 rs1045642* is generally more advantageous for lipid management, leading to decreased LDL and TG levels compared to the reference genotype AA. This result is comparable with Hoenig et al,^29^ although the *p*-value was not significant in the studied population, probably due to the relatively small number of participants used and different ethnicity. Su et al’s^39^ meta-analysis, which comprised ten studies of different ethnicities, also showed that individuals with variant and heterozygous genotype exhibited lower LDL levels than individuals with reference genotype.

The result of this gene also correlates with a prospective study (N=177) by Kadam et al^30^ in India in terms of HDL levels, which reported a significant association between genotypes for *rs1045642* of *ABCB1* and HDL level. The *ABCB1* gene encodes P-gp which regulates the transport of lipids and statins. *ABCB1* rs1045642 gene reduce the P-gp function which, thereby altering intracellular cholesterol handling in hepatic and intestinal cells. This disruption may influence hepatic cholesterol level, which in return can lead to downregulation of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a protein responsible for transferring cholesteryl esters from HDL to LDL. As a result, CETP activity is reduced, potentially leading to higher HDL level in the serum. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, this suggests a possible mechanism of genetic influence of *ABCB1* variants and HDL levels via indirectly reduced expression of CETP. This genotype is beneficial as HDL is a protective factor in CVD patients.^40^ Meanwhile, in terms of LDL level, the results are not significant due to underpowered sample size used and different ethnicity.

For the second studied SNP, the result of *CYP7A1* rs3808607 showed that the patients with reference genotype GG showed better lipid profiles than those with heterogenous and variant genotype GT or TT, making it more favorable for controlling the lipid profile. The *CYP7A1* gene or protein may be expressed less when the *CYP7A1* rs3808607 SNP is present. This decrease is caused by the G allele’s impact on promoter activity, which lowers gene transcription. A healthy lipid profile and effective lipid metabolism are supported by the GG genotype, which maintains *CYP7A1* expression and function. These results also coincide with Kadam et al., where patients with the reference genotype of *CYP7A1* (rs3808607) experienced significantly higher LDL reductions with atorvastatin therapy among male patients.^28^

It is also worth noting that the *ABCB1* rs1045642 and *CYP7A1* rs3808607 polymorphisms may be in linkage disequilibrium with other adjacent genetic variations linked with lipid metabolism, which might explain some of the correlations seen in this study. This hypothesis underlines the complexities of pharmacogenetic impacts on lipid profiles, suggesting that the observed effect may not be primarily due to the examined SNPs. Further investigations utilizing haplotype analysis and larger genome-wide techniques would be valuable in determining the particular contributions of these and other linked variations.

The significant association observed between the *ABCB1* rs1045642 polymorphism and HDL-C levels in this study suggests a potential role for pharmacogenetic testing in predicting lipid response. While routine genotyping for *ABCB1* and *CYP7A1* variants is not yet standard clinical practice, identifying individuals with specific genetic profiles may help tailor lipid-lowering therapy to optimize efficacy and reduce variability in treatment outcomes. Before implementing pharmacogenetic testing in routine care, further extensive research is necessary to confirm these results and assess their clinical value and cost-effectiveness.

### Study limitation

Firstly, the study was focused on the male population, which limits the generalizability of the findings in females. Secondly, the sample size was not enough for the statistically significant results in lipid levels across genotypes. There may be selection bias with using stored DNA samples from a previous study. However, the original recruitment criteria were independent of lipid profile status. Thus, lipid measurements were not influenced by the selection process, minimizing its impact on the current genotype-lipid association analysis. To enable statistical comparison between groups, an equal number of samples were chosen from the controlled and uncontrolled LDL groups (1:1 ratio). We do admit, though, that because this method does not accurately represent the distribution of cholesterol control status in the research population, it may create selection bias. This restriction might have an impact on the findings’ generalizability and external validity.

Therefore, in the future, further prospective cohort pharmacogenetics investigations are required on large sample sizes, with patients on different types of statins and different ethnicities, to assess the influence of different SNPs on lipid profile.

In conclusion, the allele frequency was higher in the heterozygous group in both studied SNPs. Due to their favorable lipid response, patients with the reference allele GG of gene *CYP7A1* (rs3808607) and the variant allele GG variation of gene *ABCB1* (rs1045642) may benefit from conventional or lower atorvastatin dosages, thereby lowering the risk of adverse effects.
