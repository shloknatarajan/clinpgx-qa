## Abstract

The clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen may be influenced by the activity of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme because tamixifen is metabolized by CYP2D6 to its active forms of antiestrogenic metabolite, 4‐hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen. We investigated the predictive value of the CYP2D6*10 allele, which decreased CYP2D6 activity, for clinical outcomes of patients that received adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy after surgical operation on breast cancer. Among 67 patients examined, those homozygous for the CYP2D6*10 alleles revealed a significantly higher incidence of recurrence within 10 years after the operation (P = 0.0057; odds ratio, 16.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.75–158.12), compared with those homozygous for the wild‐type CYP2D6*1 alleles. The elevated risk of recurrence seemed to be dependent on the number of CYP2D6*10 alleles (P = 0.0031 for trend). Cox proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that the CYP2D6 genotype and tumor size were independent factors affecting recurrence‐free survival. Patients with the CYP2D6*10/*10 genotype showed a significantly shorter recurrence‐free survival period (P = 0.036; adjusted hazard ratio, 10.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–86.27) compared to patients with CYP2D6*1/*1 after adjustment of other prognosis factors. The present study suggests that the CYP2D6 genotype should be considered when selecting adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer patients. (Cancer Sci 2008; 99: 995–999)

## Materials and Methods

**Patients. ** Among 1764 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with breast cancer and received surgical treatment between 1986 and 2006 at Tokushima Breast Care Clinic, 468 patients were received adjuvant monotherapy of tamoxifen. The patients who came to Tokushima Breast Care Clinic from September to November in 2007 were registered in this study according to the following criteria: (1) they received adjuvant monotherapy of tamoxifen without any chemotherapy, (2) they were ER and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive, (3) they gave written informed consent. The consecutive 72 patients that participated in this study had been treated with tamoxifen at a dose of 20 mg/body/day for 5 years. We excluded 5 ductal carcinoma *in situ* (DCIS) samples from the 72 samples and used 67 invasive breast cancer samples for the analysis. No patient received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The nuclear grade and status of ER, PR, and Her‐2 expression in breast cancer cells were investigated in 53 patents whose paraffin‐embedded tissues were available. ER and PR statuses were evaluated by immunohistochemistry according to the Allred system.^(^ [15](#b15) ^)^ The cut‐off for Her‐2 overexpression was defined as 3+ stained in immunohistochemistry.^(^ [16](#b16) ^)^ Nodal status was determined according to the International Union Against Cancer tumor‐node‐metastasis classification. Nuclear grade was classified by the criteria of National Surgical Adjuvant Study of Breast Cancer. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee at the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

**Genotyping. ** Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood of each patient using Qiagen DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The alleles of *CYP2D6***4, CYP2D6***5, CYP2D6***6, CYP2D6***10, CYP2D6***14, CYP2D6***18, CYP2D6***21*, and *CYP2D6***41* were genotyped using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based Invader assay and TaqMan assay as reported previously.^(^ [17](#b17), [18](#b18) ^)^ Briefly, we used TaKaRa *Ex Taq* HS (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) for PCR amplification using specific primers for the *CYP2D6* gene. PCR was performed on GeneAmp 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with a reaction volume of 10 µL. The PCR condition was initiated at 95°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 68°C for 4 min. After PCR, the products were diluted up to 10‐fold and used as templates for the Invader assay. The fluorescent signal was detected using ABI prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems).

**End point and statistical analysis. ** Recurrence‐free survival period was defined as the period between surgical treatment to the recurrence of a breast cancer (i.e. local or distant recurrence, or contralateral breast cancer). Patients without recurrence were censored at the date of the last follow‐up inquiry. We calculated risk estimates of an association between genotype and recurrence. An association between genetic variants of the *CYP2D6* and clinical benefit after 10 years was tested with Fisher's exact test. The trends of association between *CYP2D6* genotype and the incidence of recurrence were estimated with Cochran–Armitage test. Recurrence‐free survival was analyzed by *CYP2D6* genotype using Kaplan–Meier methods. Statistical significance of a relationship between outcome and genetic polymorphism was assessed by log‐rank test. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify significant prognostic clinical factors and to test for an independent contribution of genetic factors to the outcome variable. The significant subsets of variables in the univariate analysis were used in the multivariate analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using StatView software version 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

## Results

**Genotype frequency. ** We examined DNAs of 67 invasive breast cancer patients for the *CYP2D6***1, CYP2D6***4, CYP2D6***5, CYP2D6***6, CYP2D6***10, CYP2D6***14, CYP2D6***18, CYP2D6***21*, and *CYP2D6***41 *alleles ([Table 2](#t2)). The allele frequency of *CYP2D6***10* was calculated to be 41.8%. Seven patients carried the *CYP2D6***5* heterozygous variant, indicating its allele frequency to be 5.2%. There was one heterozygous patient for each of the *CYP2D6***4*, *CYP2D6***21*, or *CYP2D6***41* allelles. No *CYP2D6***6*, *CYP2D6***14*, and *CYP2D6***18* allele was observed in this test population. We then focused on patients with the *CYP2D6***10/***10*, *CYP2D6***1/***10*, and *CYP2D6***1/***1* genotypes for the following analysis because the frequencies of the other alleles were too low to be analyzed.

**Associations between genotype and clinical outcome. ** Patients with the *CYP2D6***10/***10* genotype revealed a significantly higher incidence of recurrence than those with the *CYP2D6***1/***1* genotype (*P =* 0.0057; odds ratio, 16.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.75–158.12; [Table 3](#t3)) or the combined patient group carrying at least one *CYP2D6***1* allele (*CYP2D6***1/***1* + **1/***10*) (*P =* 0.0079; odds ratio, 6.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.68–26.38). The tendency of an increase of the incidence of recurrence by an increase of the number of *CYP2D6***10* alleles (*P =* 0.0031 for trend) was also observed. Kaplan–Meier estimates indicated the significantly shorter recurrence‐free survival for patients with *CYP2D6***10/***10* than those with *CYP2D6***1/***1* or those with *CYP2D6***1/***1 +* **1/***10* (*P =* 0.0031 or *P* = 0.0010; [Fig. 1](#f1)). In the univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis for recurrence‐free survival, *CYP2D6* genotype (**10/***10 versus* **1/***1*) and tumor size were considered to be significantly associated factors ([Table 4](#t4)). In the multivariate analysis with the significant parameters in the univariate analysis, the *CYP2D6* genotype still remained an independent indicator of recurrence after adjustment for tumor size (*P =* 0.036; adjusted hazard ratio, 10.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–86.27 for *CYP2D6***10/***10*).

## Discussion

Some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10‐year survival of women with ER‐positive tumors (including unknown ER status), with the significant reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality.^(^ [1](#b1) ^)^ Although aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have demonstrated their superiority to tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, there are some reports indicating that AIs are associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis than tamoxifen.^(^ [19](#b19), [20](#b20) ^)^ In addition, the cost of tamoxifen therapy is significantly lower than that of AIs. Considering many years of administration of these drugs, the effect on the medical cost is not small. Therefore, tamoxifen will still play a major therapeutic role in ER‐positive breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the association of the *CYP2D6***10* allele, which encodes the unstable protein (hence, the enzymatic activity is low) and is most frequently found in Asians, including Japanese people, with clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. We here demonstrated that patients with *CYP2D6***10/***10* showed a significantly higher incidence of recurrence than patients with *CYP2D6***1/***1*.

In clinical studies in Caucasians, patients with the *CYP2D6***4/***4* genotype, classified as PMs, had poorer clinical outcomes with shorter recurrence‐free and disease‐free survivals, and it was also shown that the 5‐year recurrence‐free survival rate for *CYP2D6***4/***4* patients was only 54%, compared with 83% for those who were not carriers of the *CYP2D6***4* allele.^(^ [10](#b10) ^)^ In this study, the 10‐year recurrence‐free survival rates between the *CYP2D6***1/***1* and *CYP2D6***10/***10* groups were significantly different (95% and 53.3%, *P =* 0.0057). The plasma concentrations of endoxifen in patients with *CYP2D6***10/***10* was reported to be as low as for PMs.^(^ [9](#b9), [21](#b21) ^)^ It is also reported that the conversion rate of endoxifen from *N*‐desmethyltamoxifen by mutant enzyme encoded by *CYP2D6***10* was only 7.4% of that of the wild‐type protein in *in vitro* analysis.^(^ [22](#b22) ^)^ These lines of evidence imply that *CYP2D6***10* remarkably reduces the plasma levels of active metabolites, and influences the clinical outcomes in adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, although the degree of its effects are not conclusive due to the small sample size.

The 5‐year recurrence‐free survival rate of patients with *CYP2D6***10/***10* (86.7%) tended to be lower than that with *CYP2D6***1/***1* (100%), without statistical significance (*P =* 0.18; data not shown), although 10‐year recurrence‐free survival rates were significantly different between the two genotypes. This result can be explained by the lower recurrence rate within the first 5 years for all patients in this study compared with a previous report^(^ [2](#b2) ^)^ ([Fig. 2](#f2)). This observation might be caused by a limited number of samples and a limited registration period (3 months). Some of the patients with early recurrence were obviously unable to participate in this study because they could not visit the clinic due to their poor health condition or death. Therefore, further analysis using a large number of registered patients with longer entry periods is required for verification of our results and investigation of the effect of *CYP2D6***10* on overall survival.

Annual hazard rates for recurrence‐free survival comparing patients with the CYP2D6*1/*1, *1/*10 and *10/*10 genotypes.

The allelic frequency of *CYP2D6***10* has been reported to be 38.6% (41.8% in this study) in the Japanese population.^(^ [23](#b23) ^)^ Approximately 15% of Japanese people are estimated to have the *CYP2D6***10/***10* genotype. Although the PM frequency in Japanese is lower than in Caucasians, several PM‐ or intermediate (IM)‐related polymorphisms in the *CYP2D6* gene were reported (i.e. **4*, **5*, **14*, **18*, **21*, **41*, **44*),^(^ [21](#b21), [22](#b22), [23](#b23), [24](#b24) ^)^ and their combined frequency was 11.4%.^(^ [23](#b23), [24](#b24), [25](#b25), [26](#b26) ^)^ Hence, the frequency of heterozygote for **10* and either of these alleles was suspected to be 8–9%. Therefore, the frequency of subjects classified as IM‐related to the *CYP2D6***10* allele was estimated to be 23–24%. Patients heterozygous for the *CYP2D6***10* allele and the other null allele also revealed the IM phenotype, which might have a higher risk of recurrence at a level almost the same as for PMs.^(^ [27](#b27) ^)^ These data indicate that *CYP2D6***10* is one of the most important determinants for clinical outcomes in adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, especially in the Asian population. The application of pharmacogenomic/pharmacogenetic information to clinical treatment is expected to contribute to the prediction of drug efficacy and/or toxicity of individual patients. The genotyping of *CYP2D6*, including *CYP2D6***10*, should become an important predictor for the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment for individual breast cancer patients.
