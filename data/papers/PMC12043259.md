## Abstract

In Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally protocol A5372, a pharmacokinetic study of dolutegravir with 1-month of daily rifapentine/isoniazid, twice-daily dolutegravir offset the induction effects of rifapentine on plasma dolutegravir trough concentrations (Ctrough). Here, we characterize the impact on dolutegravir Ctrough of UGT1A1, AADAC, and NAT2 polymorphisms that affect dolutegravir, rifapentine, and isoniazid, respectively. People with HIV receiving dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy with an indication to treat latent tuberculosis underwent pharmacokinetic sampling during dolutegravir 50 mg once daily alone, and on day 28 of dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily with rifapentine/isoniazid. Multivariable linear regression models characterized genetic associations with dolutegravir Ctrough. Among 30 participants evaluable for genetic associations, median (Q1, Q3) day 0 dolutegravir Ctrough was 1745 (1099, 2694) ng/ml, and day 28 was 2146 (1412, 2484) ng/ml. Day 28 Ctrough was higher with UGT1A1 rs887829 TT [geometric mean ratio (GMR) = 1.65; 90% confidence interval (CI): 0.97–2.78] and CT (GMR = 1.38; 90% CI: 1.02–1.86) than with CC, and was higher with AADAC rs1803155 GG (GMR = 1.79; 90% CI: 1.09–2.93) and AG (GMR = 1.48; 90% CI: 1.14–1.90) than with AA. Median day 28 Ctrough ranged from 1205 (1063, 1897) ng/ml with 4 total UGT1A1 and AADAC risk alleles, to 3882 and 3717 ng/ml with only one risk allele. Individuals with concomitant AADAC slow metabolizer and UGT1A1 normal metabolizer genotypes may be at greater risk for clinically significant drug–drug interactions between rifapentine/isoniazid and dolutegravir.

## Introduction

People with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk of progressing from latent tuberculosis infection (TBI) to active tuberculosis [[1](#R1)]. While isoniazid monotherapy for 6–12 months has historically been used for tuberculosis preventive therapy [[2](#R2)], shorter rifapentine-containing regimens have proven effective. In the BRIEF-TB trial, 4 weeks of daily rifapentine/isoniazid (600 mg/300 mg), the ‘1HP’ regimen, was noninferior to 9 months of daily isoniazid in PWH on efavirenz- or nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy [[3](#R3)].

Rifapentine induces many hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, which decrease plasma exposure of HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI). Isoniazid inhibits several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms [[4](#R4)], which may increase plasma exposure of substrate drugs. The INSTI dolutegravir (50 mg once daily), a component of the WHO-recommended first-line regimen [[5](#R5)], is primarily metabolized by UDP glucosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 [[6](#R6)]. Frequent genetic variants predict greater plasma exposure of these drugs, including dolutegravir with the *UGT1A1* Gilbert polymorphism [[7](#R7),[8](#R8)], rifapentine with the *AADAC* rs1803155 A allele [[9](#R9)], and isoniazid with *NAT2* polymorphisms [[4](#R4),[10](#R10),[11](#R11)].

Dolutegravir trough concentration (C_trough_) is the pharmacokinetic parameter that best predicts virologic response [[12](#R12),[13](#R13)]. In Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally (ACTG) study A5372 ([NCT 04272242](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04272242)), dolutegravir C_trough_ values were modestly greater with twice-daily dolutegravir plus 1HP than with once-daily dolutegravir alone [[14](#R14)]. Here, we characterize the pharmacogenetics of dolutegravir C_trough_ in A5372.

## Methods

### Study design

Study A5372 investigated pharmacokinetic interactions at 4 weeks between 1HP and twice-daily dolutegravir among PWH with TBI [[13](#R13)]. Approvals were obtained from the Ethics Committee for each site, and participants gave written informed consent. Participants were receiving dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapy, which included two nucleos[t]ides, for at least 28 days before entry. All participants received 1HP, which comprised 28 once-daily doses of rifapentine/isoniazid (600 mg/300 mg). All participants completed 1HP within 30 days. Adherence was assessed by patient self-report.

### Pharmacokinetic sampling

On day 0 (dolutegravir 50 mg once daily without 1HP), serial pharmacokinetic sampling included C_trough_ at 24 h ± 15 min postdose. On day 1, dolutegravir was increased to 50 mg twice daily. Daily rifapentine/isoniazid was prescribed from day 1 to day 28. On day 28 (−2 to +14 day window), repeat serial sampling included C_trough_ at 12 h ± 15 min postdose. Three consecutive days of adherent dosing was required before sampling.

### Genetics polymorphisms

Human DNA extracted from blood was genotyped for *UGT1A1* (rs887829) [[7](#R7),[8](#R8)], *AADAC* (rs1803155) [[9](#R9)], and *NAT2* (rs1799930, rs1799931, rs1801279, and rs1801280) [[4](#R4),[10](#R10),[11](#R11)] at VANTAGE (Vanderbilt Technology for Advanced Genomics) using Taqman (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).

### Statistical analysis

Associations of dolutegravir C_trough_ were assessed by linear regression models using STATA version 17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA), adjusting for screening BMI, which was retained in the model by default. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) summarized between-group comparisons. Antilogs of GMR and confidence bounds are reported.

For *UGT1A1* rs887829, CC, CT, and TT were classified as normal, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively. For *AADAC* rs1803155, GG, AG, and AA were classified as normal, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively. For *NAT2*, acetylator groups were defined based on rs1801280 (*NAT2*5*), rs1799930 (*NAT2*6*), rs1799931 (*NAT2*7*), and rs1801279 (*NAT2*14*) as described elsewhere [[15](#R15)]. We did not correct for multiple comparisons. Two-sided statistical tests were used. *P*-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Trough concentrations were natural log-transformed.

### UGT1A1 rs887829 and dolutegravir C trough

At day 0 (before starting rifapentine/isoniazid), *UGT1A1* rs887829 was associated with dolutegravir C_trough_. Compared with rs887829 CC normal metabolizers, day 0 C_trough_ was higher in CT intermediate metabolizers (GMR = 1.51; 90% CI: 1.10–2.07), and in TT poor metabolizers (GMR = 1.90; 90% CI: 1.09–3.28). At day 28 (with rifapentine/isoniazid), *UGT1A1* rs887829 was still associated with dolutegravir C_trough_, although the GMR values were somewhat less than at day 0. Compared with rs887829 CC normal metabolizers, day 28 C_trough_ was higher in CT intermediate metabolizers (GMR = 1.38; 90% CI: 1.02–1.86), and in TT poor metabolizers (GMR = 1.65; 90% CI: 0.97–2.78). Relationships between *UGT1A1* genotype and dolutegravir C_trough_ are shown in Fig. [1](#F1)a.

### AADAC rs1803155 and dolutegravir Ctrough

At day 0, there was no association between *AADAC* rs1803155 and dolutegravir C_trough_. Compared with *rs1803155* AA poor metabolizers (more frequent than normal genotype, so used as the reference group), day 0 C_trough_ was similar in AG intermediate metabolizers (GMR = 1.11; 90% CI: 0.82–1.52), and in GG normal metabolizers (GMR = 1.11; 90% CI: 0.61–2.02). In contrast, at day 28, *AADAC* rs1803155 was associated with dolutegravir C_trough_. Compared with *rs1803155* AA poor metabolizers, day 28 C_trough_ was higher in AG intermediate metabolizers (GMR = 1.48; 90% CI: 1.14–1.90), and in GG normal metabolizers (GMR = 1.79; 90% CI: 1.09–2.93). Relationships between *AADAC rs1803155* genotype and dolutegravir C_trough_ are shown in Fig. [1](#F1)b. Results of multivariable models that include *UGT1A1* rs887829, *AADAC* rs1803155, and BMI are presented in Table [2](#T2).

### NAT2 acetylator status and dolutegravir C trough

At days 0 and 28, in multivariable models that adjusted for *UGT1A1* rs887829, *AADAC* rs1803155, and screening BMI, there was no association between *NAT2* acetylator status and dolutegravir C_trough_ (Supplemental Material, Supplemental digital content 1, [http://links.lww.com/FPC/B510](http://links.lww.com/FPC/B510)). Compared with *NAT2* slow acetylators, day 28 C_trough_ was similar in intermediate acetylators (GMR = 0.91; 90% CI: 0.70–1.19), and in rapid acetylators (GMR = 0.86; 90% CI: 0.55–1.35).

### Total number of AADAC and UGT1A1 risk alleles and day 28 C trough

There was an ordinal relationship between number of risk alleles for lower dolutegravir C_trough_ values (i.e. *UGT1A1* rs887829 C and *AADAC* rs1803155 A alleles) and day 28 C_trough_ (Fig. [1](#F1)c). Among the six participants with four risk alleles (i.e. rs887829 CC normal dolutegravir metabolism, and rs1803155 AA poor rifapentine metabolism), median day 28 C_trough_ was 1205 ng/ml [interquartile range (IQR): 1079, 1530 ng/ml]. In contrast, the two participants with only one risk allele had day 28 C_trough_ values of 3882 ng/ml and 3717 ng/ml. Participants with two or three risk alleles had intermediate C_trough_ values of 2290 ng/ml (IQR: 1936, 2495 ng/ml) and 2049 ng/ml (IQR: 1400, 2305 ng/ml), respectively.

## Discussion

Among A5372 participants [[14](#R14)], *UGT1A1* rs887829 and *AADAC* rs1803155 were independently associated with day 28 dolutegravir C_trough_. The *UGT1A1* association was expected based on previous reports [[7](#R7),[8](#R8),[16](#R16)]. For example, among 284 South Africans in the ADVANCE trial, rs887829 C/T and T/T were associated with 10.8% and 25.9% slower dolutegravir clearance, respectively, compared with C/C [[8](#R8)]. The rs887829 T allele is in strong linkage with *UGT1A1*28*, the Gilbert trait allele (a promoter TA_n_ dinucleotide) that confers decreased gene expression [[17](#R17)].

Dolutegravir is not a substrate for arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC), which is encoded by *AADAC*. Rifapentine is an AADAC substrate [[18](#R18)], and the *AADAC* rs1803155 A allele has been associated with slower rifapentine clearance [[9](#R9)]. Among individuals carrying *AADAC* rs1803155 A alleles, higher plasma rifapentine concentrations likely cause greater induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, which may explain the lower plasma dolutegravir C_trough_.

Isoniazid inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19 [[4](#R4)], and *NAT2* slow acetylators have higher plasma isoniazid concentrations. We found no association between *NAT2* slow acetylators and higher dolutegravir C_trough_ values. Strong enzyme induction by rifapentine may dominate isoniazid’s modest inhibitory effect, despite higher isoniazid concentrations, or hepatic enzymes inhibited by isoniazid may not be important for dolutegravir.

Dolutegravir C_trough_ was better predicted by *UGT1A1* and *AADAC* risk alleles together than each separately. Median dolutegravir C_trough_ concentrations were approximately three-fold lower among individual with four risk alleles than among the two participants with a single risk allele. Dolutegravir C_trough_ concentrations were intermediate among individuals with two or three risk alleles. Both the *AADAC* rs1803155 A allele and UGT1A1 rs887829 C allele are frequent worldwide [[19](#R19)], such that approximately 17% of Africans, and 15–30% of people worldwide have four risk alleles, and are anticipated to have the lowest dolutegravir C_trough_ concentrations when taking once-daily dolutegravir and rifapentine. It is reassuring that, even with four risk alleles, C_trough_ values with dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily were well above 64 ng/ml, the *in vitro*, protein-adjusted IC_90_ for wild-type HIV-1 [[20](#R20)]. While not addressed in the present study, as we consider dosing dolutegravir 50 mg once daily with 1HP, one wonders whether individuals with four risk alleles are also at risk for lower dolutegravir C_trough_ concentrations if prescribed dolutegravir 50 mg once daily with 1HP. Because induction of hepatic enzymes by rifapentine takes about 2 weeks to reach full effect, dolutegravir C_trough_ would only be low during the latter weeks of 1HP. Also, because dolutegravir slowly dissociates from intracellular integrase-DNA complexes [[21](#R21)], antiviral activity may persist despite dolutegravir C_trough_ falling below the IC_90_.

In summary, among PWH receiving dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily with daily rifapentine/isoniazid, *AADAC* and *UGT1A1* polymorphisms were associated with dolutegravir C_trough_. This is not clinically relevant with twice-daily dosing but may be important to study in evaluations of once-daily dolutegravir with rifapentine. This study reinforces the importance of evaluating pharmacogenetic effects on drug–drug interactions.
