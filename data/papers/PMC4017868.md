## Abstract

**Background:** 
Alcoholism is a polygenic disorder resulting from reward deficiency; polymorphisms in reward genes including serotonin transporter (5-HTT)-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), A118G in opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), and −141C Insertion/Deletion (Ins/Del) in dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) as well as environmental factors (education and marital status) might affect the risk of alcoholism. Objective of the current study was to examine the main and interacting effect of these 3 polymorphisms and 2 environmental factors in contribution to alcoholism in Mexican Americans.

**Methods:** 
Genotyping of 5-HTTLPR, OPRM1 A118G, and DRD2−141C Ins/Del was performed in 365 alcoholics and 338 nonalcoholic controls of Mexican Americans who were gender-and age-matched. Alcoholics were stratified according to tertiles of MAXDRINKS, which denotes the largest number of drinks consumed in one 24-hour period. Data analysis was done in the entire data set and in each alcoholic stratum. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to explore the main effect of 3 polymorphisms and 2 environmental factors (education and marital status); classification tree, generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis, and polymorphism interaction analysis version 2.0 (PIA 2) program were used to study factor interaction.

**Results:** 
Main effect of education, OPRM1, and DRD2 was detected in alcoholic stratum of moderate and/or largest MAXDRINKS with education ≤12 years, OPRM1 118 A/A, and DRD2 −141C Ins/Ins being risk factors. Classification tree analysis, GMDR analysis, and PIA 2 program all supported education*OPRM1 interaction in alcoholics of largest MAXDRINKS with education ≤12 years coupled with OPRM1 A/A being a high risk factor; dendrogram showed synergistic interaction between these 2 factors; dosage-effect response was also observed for education*OPRM1 interaction. No definite effect of marital status and 5-HTTLPR in pathogenesis of alcoholism was observed.

**Conclusions:** 
Our results suggest main effect of education background, OPRM1 A118G, and DRD2 −141C Ins/Del as well as education*OPRM1 interaction in contribution to moderate and/or severe alcoholism in Mexican Americans. Functional relevance of these findings still needs to be explored.

### Background

Alcoholism is a polygenic disorder resulting from reward deficiency; polymorphisms in reward genes including serotonin transporter (5-HTT)-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), A118G in opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), and −141C Insertion/Deletion (Ins/Del) in dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) as well as environmental factors (education and marital status) might affect the risk of alcoholism. Objective of the current study was to examine the main and interacting effect of these 3 polymorphisms and 2 environmental factors in contribution to alcoholism in Mexican Americans.

### Methods

Genotyping of 5-HTTLPR, OPRM1 A118G, and DRD2−141C Ins/Del was performed in 365 alcoholics and 338 nonalcoholic controls of Mexican Americans who were gender-and age-matched. Alcoholics were stratified according to tertiles of MAXDRINKS, which denotes the largest number of drinks consumed in one 24-hour period. Data analysis was done in the entire data set and in each alcoholic stratum. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to explore the main effect of 3 polymorphisms and 2 environmental factors (education and marital status); classification tree, generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis, and polymorphism interaction analysis version 2.0 (PIA 2) program were used to study factor interaction.

### Results

Main effect of education, OPRM1, and DRD2 was detected in alcoholic stratum of moderate and/or largest MAXDRINKS with education ≤12 years, OPRM1 118 A/A, and DRD2 −141C Ins/Ins being risk factors. Classification tree analysis, GMDR analysis, and PIA 2 program all supported education*OPRM1 interaction in alcoholics of largest MAXDRINKS with education ≤12 years coupled with OPRM1 A/A being a high risk factor; dendrogram showed synergistic interaction between these 2 factors; dosage-effect response was also observed for education*OPRM1 interaction. No definite effect of marital status and 5-HTTLPR in pathogenesis of alcoholism was observed.

### Conclusions

Our results suggest main effect of education background, OPRM1 A118G, and DRD2 −141C Ins/Del as well as education*OPRM1 interaction in contribution to moderate and/or severe alcoholism in Mexican Americans. Functional relevance of these findings still needs to be explored.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Study Population

Unrelated Mexican Americans living in the Los Angeles County including 338 controls and 365 alcoholics were recruited (109 controls and 200 alcoholics were from our previous studies) ([Konishi et al., 2004b](#R33); [Luo et al., 2005](#R37)). Controls and alcoholics were gender-and age-matched. Participants were recruited from a variety of sources including: (1) Human services, substances dependence, and mental health programs; (2) driving schools and the Alcohol Anonymous Groups organized and/or associated with these schools; (3) bars and liquor stores; (4) Hispanic churches with counseling services programs; (5) day labor centers; and (6) Hispanic newspapers, radio stations, and television stations. The alcoholic participants fulfilled the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth Edition* (DSM-IV) criteria for a current diagnosis of either alcohol dependence (303.90) or alcohol abuse (305.00). Control participants fulfilled the following criteria: (1) no current or past diagnosis of DSM-IV alcohol dependence (303.90) or alcohol abuse (305.00); and (2) no clinically unacceptable findings from physical examinations and vital signs. The inclusion criteria for both controls and alcoholics were as follows: (1) ability to give informed consent; (2) between 21 and 79 years; (3) 3 of 4 biological grandparents of Mexican heritage; (4) fluency in either Spanish or English; (5) no current use of other substances (except tobacco and caffeine), or history of such use within the past 6 months; and (6) no current or past diagnosis of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizotypal disorder, major depression, or bipolar disorder. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The use of participants’ DNA samples was approved by the Human Subjects Committees at the University of Kansas Medical Center and Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983.

### Interview Instrument

Every participant was interviewed with a standard questionnaire to collect the information including gender, age, marital status, duration of education, medical history, history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Marital status was categorized into 3 types: being married, being single or living with a partner. Having been divorced, separated, and widowed was regarded as being single. Current smoking was defined as having smoked 1 or more cigarettes on 1 or more days during the past 30 days ([Christophi et al., 2008](#R14)). Each alcoholic was interviewed with The Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism II (SSAGA-II) ([Bucholz et al., 1994](#R12)). Information of MAXDRINKS was collected according to participants’ response to the question in SSAGA “What’s the largest number of drinks you have had in a 24-hour period?”

### Genotyping

Peripheral venous blood samples were collected for all participants and kept at −70°C until DNA extraction. The frozen blood was thawed and leukocyte DNA was isolated by a rapid nonenzymatic method ([Lahiri and Nurnberger, 1991](#R35)) or by GeneCatcher gDNA blood kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

OPRM1 A118G and −141C Ins /Del genotypes were determined by PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis according to [Gelernter and colleagues (1999)](#R23) and [Arinami and colleagues (1997)](#R2), respectively. The 5-HTTLPR genotype was determined by PCR amplification according to [Collier and colleagues (1996)](#R15). 5-HTTLPR and DRD2 −141C Ins /Del genotypes of 109 controls and 200 alcoholics had been determined in our previous studies ([Konishi et al., 2004b](#R33)).

### Statistical Analysis

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls as well as in alcoholics was tested for all the 3 polymorphisms with the HWSIM program. Pearson’s chi-square test was conducted to compare the gender, smoking status, and marital status distribution between controls and alcoholics. Age and education background difference was evaluated with both Pearson’s chi-square test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Main effect of each factor or factor combination was explored with binary or multinomial logistic regression. Interaction among different factors was studied with classification tree analysis, generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) program, and polymorphism interaction analysis program version 2.0 (PIA2). The grayscale interaction dendrogram was adapted from the colorful dendrogram made by multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) program version 2.0-alpha (MDR 2.0-alpha). Pearson’s chi-square test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and logistic regression were performed with SPSS 15.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). *p* < 0.05 was taken as significance level for all statistical analyses. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons.

## RESULTS

### Demographics of Participants

There were 80 (23.7%) and 69 (18.9%) females in 338 non-alcoholic controls and 365 alcoholics, respectively. There was no significant difference in gender distribution between these 2 cohorts (χ^2^ = 2.385, *p* = 0.122).

The number of young (≤30 years), middle-aged (30 to 60 years), and old (>60 years) participants in 338 controls was 93 (27.5%), 237 (70.1%), and 8 (2.4%), respectively. In the alcoholic group (365), there were 99 (27.1%) young, 257 (70.4%) middle-aged, and 9 (2.5%) old participants. The median age for controls was the same as that of alcoholics (37 years). No significant difference was found regarding age distribution with Pearson’s chi-square test (χ^2^ = 0.019, *p* = 0.991) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (Z = −1.032, *p* = 0.301).

Six control participants did not provide the information of smoking history. There were significantly more current smokers in 365 alcoholics than in 332 controls (45.5% vs. 17.2%, χ^2^ = 64.045, *p* < 0.001).

Seventeen controls and 8 alcoholics did not provide the information of marital status. The number of participants who were married, single and living with a partner was 120 (37.4%), 185 (57.6%), and 16 (5.0%) in 321 controls, while the number was 113 (31.7%), 215 (60.2%), and 29 (8.1%) in 357 alcoholics. No significant difference was found between these 2 cohorts regarding distribution of marital status (χ^2^ = 4.317, *p* = 0.116).

As to education background, fifteen controls and 4 alcoholics did not provide the information. The median duration of education for 323 controls and 361 alcoholics was 12 and 11 years, respectively. There were 111 (34.4%) controls and 75 (20.8%) alcoholics who had received education of more than 12 years. Significant difference was found between these 2 cohorts with Wilcoxon rank sum test (Z = −2.663, *p* = 0.008) and chi-square test (χ^2^ = 15.902, *p* < 0.001).

There were 2 alcoholics who did not provide the information of MAXDRINKS. For the rest 363 alcoholics, the minimum, maximum, and median MAXDRINKS was 4, 100 and 25, respectively. The skewness value was 1.203 with a standard error of 0.128, and the kurtosis value was 1.544 with a standard error of 0.255. The first and second tertile of MAXDRINKS was 22 and 35, respectively. There were 124 (34.2%) alcoholics with MAXDRINKS ≤ 22, 121 (33.3%) with MAXDRINKS 23 to 35, and 118 (32.5%) with MAXDRINKS ≥ 36.

### Main Effect of Each Individual Factor on Alcoholism

Genotype distribution in controls as well as in alcoholics for each of the 3 studied polymorphisms was in HWE (*p* > 0.05, [Table 1](#T1) and [Table S1](#SD1)).

Table 1 Caption: Genotype Distribution of 5-HTTLPR, OPRM1 A118G, and DRD2 −141C Ins/Del in Controls and Alcoholics

Controlling for the confounding effect of gender, age, and smoking status, the binary logistic regression model was constructed to explore the main effect of marriage status, education background, 5-HTTLPR, OPRM1 A118G and DRD2 −141C Ins/Del on alcoholism. With all alcoholics included, the model showed that only duration of education was associated with alcoholism (*p* = 0.002, [Table 2](#T2)). Compared with education of more than 12 years, education of less than or equal to 12 years was a risk factor for alcoholism with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.792 (95%CI 1.236 to 2.604).

Table 2 Caption: Main Effects of Environmental and Genetic Factors on Alcoholism With Multinomial Logistic Regression Controlling for the Effect of Gender, Age, and Smoking Status

When alcoholics were divided into 3 subgroups according to tertiles of MAXDRINKS, the multinomial logistic regression analysis controlling for the effect of confounding factors indicated that alcoholics with different MAXDRINKS were related to different risk factors ([Table 2](#T2)). For alcoholics with the largest MAXDRINKS (≥36), education of less than or equal to 12 years, OPRM1 118 A/A, and DRD2 −141C Ins /Ins were all risk factors with the ORs being 1.966, 2.162, and 1.847, respectively. For alcoholics with medium MAXDRINKS (23 to 35), only education of less than or equal to 12 years was found to be a risk factor with an OR of 2.032. For alcoholics with the smallest MAXDRINKS (≤22), neither the environmental factors (marital status and education background), nor the genetic factors (5-HTTLPR, OPRM1 A118G and DRD2 −141C Ins/Del) were associated with alcoholism.

### Interaction Among Environmental and Genetic Factors

#### Classification Tree Analysis

Classification tree analysis including the 2 environmental (marital status and education background) and 3 genetic factors (OPRM1, HTTLPR, and DRD2) was performed through consecutive data splitting. No factor interaction was detected when all alcoholics, alcoholic subgroup with MAXDRINKS ≤ 22 or with MAXDRINKS 23 to 35 were considered. For overall alcoholics and alcoholic subgroup with MAXDRINKS 23 to 35, only a splitting by education background can be made (*p* < 0.001 and *p* = 0.001, respectively). For alcoholic subgroup with MAXDRINKS ≤ 22, no splittings can be made. For alcoholic subgroup of MAXDRINKS ≥ 36, 3 consecutive splittings by education background, OPRM1 and HTTLPR were made, and a Bonferroni corrected *p*-value which was less than 0.05 was observed for each splitting ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Binary logistic regression controlling for effect of gender, age, smoking and DRD2 was adopted to compare the effect of each factor combination ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Education ≤12 years had to be combined with at least 1 genetic risk factor (OPRM1 A/A and/or HTTLPR S/S) to become a risk factor, although it was found to have main effect on pathogenesis of alcoholism, indicating interactions among education background, OPRM1 and HTTLPR.

Interaction among genetic and environmental factors with alcoholics of MAXDRINKS ≥ 36 by classification tree analysis. p-Value and OR of each factor combination were decided by binary logistic regression controlling for effect of gender, age, smoking, and DRD2.

#### GMDR Analysis

With the 2 environmental (marital status and education background) and 3 genetic factors (OPRM1, HTTLPR, and DRD2), GMDR analysis controlling for effect of gender, age, and smoking constructed different risk prediction models for alcoholic subgroups of different MAXDRINKS ([Table 3](#T3)). For overall alcoholics and alcoholics of MAXDRINKS 23 to 35, the best prediction model contained only 1 factor, the education background, whose testing balanced accuracy was 56.25 and 57.04%, respectively. For alcoholics of MAXDRINKS ≤ 22, no environmental or genetic factors were suitable for risk prediction. For alcoholics of MAXDRINKS ≥ 36, the 2-factor model consisting of education background and OPRM1 showed the best prediction efficacy with sign test *p*-value less than 0.05, highest cross-validation consistency (10/10) and highest testing balanced accuracy (63.16%), suggesting interaction between education background and OPRM1. Combination of education≤12 years and OPRM1 A/A served as a high risk factor for alcoholism of MAXDRINKS ≥ 36, while the other combinations served as low risk factors ([Fig. 2](#F2)).

Interaction between OPRM1 and education by GMDR analysis. Dark gray and light gray boxes correspond to the high- and low-risk factor combinations, respectively. The left and right bars within each box correspond to cases and controls, respectively. The top number is the sum of scores for the corresponding group of individuals (cases or controls with particular factor combination). The heights of the bars are proportional to the sum of scores in each group. For education, 0 means ≤12 years, and 1 means >12 years. For OPRM1, 0 means A/A, and 1 means A/G&G/G.

#### Analysis With PIA2 Program

With 7 different scoring functions including % correct, sensitivity + specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) + negative predictive value (NPV), risk ratio, odds ratio, and Gini Index, PIA2 software was used to further evaluate the efficacy of risk prediction models containing different number of factors ([Table 4](#T4)). For alcoholics of MAXDRINKS ≥ 36, education*OPRM1 and education*OPRM1*HTTLPR were shown to be the best 2-factor and 3-factor model with highest overall score, respectively, supporting the findings regarding factor interaction revealed by classification tree and GMDR analysis.

#### Dendrogram Regarding Education*OPRM1*HTTLPR Interaction

A dendrogram regarding the relationship among education background, OPRM1, and HTTLPR for alcoholics of MAXDRINKS ≥ 36 was made by MDR 2.0-alpha software ([Fig. 3](#F3)). Education background and HTTLPR were shown to be redundant with each other, while OPRM1 was synergistic with both education background and HTTLPR.

Dendrogram of interaction among education, OPRM1, and HTTLPR. The gray scale represents a continuum from Synergy to Redundancy. It ranges from black representing a high degree of synergy (positive information gain) to white representing the highest degree of redundancy (negative information gain).

#### Dose-Effect Response of Factor Interaction

For education*OPRM1 interaction detected with alcoholics of MAXDRINKS ≥ 36, dosage-effect response was observed by binary logistic regression controlling for effect of gender, age, smoking, and DRD2 ([Table 5](#T5)). Between individuals containing no and 1 risk factor, the risk for severe alcoholism with MAXDRINKS ≥ 36 was not significantly different (*p* = 0.694). Individuals containing both 2 risk factors, however, were more susceptible to severe alcoholism (*p* = 0.003, OR = 3.258).

|   | Factor combination | p-Value | OR (95% CI) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No risk factors* | Both education>12 years and OPRM1 A/G & G/G | Reference | NA |
| One risk factor* | Either education ≤12 years or OPRM1 A/A | 0.694 | NA |
| Two risk factors* | Both education ≤12 years and OPRM1 A/A | 0.003 | 3.258 (1.509–7.035) |

## DISCUSSION

In this study, we found the main effect of education background, OPRM1 A118G, and DRD2 −141C Ins/Del as well as the interaction between education background and OPRM1 A118G in modulating risk for alcoholism in Mexican Americans. Education ≤12 years, OPRM1 A/A, and DRD2 Ins/Ins were shown to be risk factors. No definite effect of marital status and 5-HTTLPR in pathogenesis of alcoholism was observed.

Individuals of lower socioeconomic status are at greater risk for alcoholism. Duration of education reflects the individual’s socioeconomic background, insofar as opportunities for schooling are influenced by parental resources ([Gilman et al., 2008](#R24)), so it’s not surprising to find education ≤12 years was a risk factor for alcoholism in Mexican Americans. Improving education level might serve as a preventive strategy for alcoholism in this minority group. With respect to OPRM1 A118G and DRD2 −141C Ins /Del, functional significance is not well established ([Arinami et al., 1997](#R2); [Bond et al., 1998](#R9); [Jonsson et al., 1999](#R31); [Zhang et al., 2005](#R54)); the mechanism accounting for the causative effect of OPRM1 A/A and DRD2 −141C Ins/Ins still remains to be elucidated.

Regarding the main effect of DRD2 −141C Ins/Del on alcoholism in Mexican Americans, findings of our current study are similar to those revealed by our previous study with a smaller sample size (251 controls and 200 alcoholics) and chi-square test. The current results about main effect of 5-HTTLPR are conflicting with our previous ones which indicated S/S to be a risk factor, probably due to different sample sizes and statistical methods. For the main effect of the 2 environmental factors and 3 genetic factors on alcoholism considered in this study, a number of studies conducted in other ethnic groups have yielded conflicting results. This controversy might be caused by: (1) different sample size, ethnicity, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns; (2) different status of population stratification and sample heterogeneity; and (3) neglect of gene-gene interactions. In our current study participants with 3 of 4 biological grandparents of Mexican heritage were recruited to ensure ethnic homogeneity and avoid population stratification. In addition, we have performed genotyping for many other polymorphisms in this population ([Konishi et al., 2003](#R34), [2004a](#R32),[b](#R33); [Luo et al., 2005](#R37); [Mendoza et al., 2001](#R41); [Yang et al., 2007](#R52)) finding that the allele frequencies were consistent with those reported by other studies of Mexican Americans. In addition, effect of confounding factors was controlled and factor interactions were considered, which also enhance the reliability of our findings.

Three strategies with different advantages were used simultaneously in this study to indentify interactions among the 2 environmental (education background and marital status) and 3 genetic factors (OPRM1, HTTLPR, and DRD2). The main advantage of classification tree analysis is that multiple comparisons can be corrected in a stringent way; GMDR analysis can not only control for the effect of confounders, but also verify the interactions by dividing the data into training and testing set; PIA2 program includes 7 different scoring functions for evaluation of prediction models. Combination of these 3 strategies will lead to a more reliable result. Classification tree analysis indicated education*OPRM1*HTTLPR interaction, while GMDR analysis suggested education *OPRM1 interaction. For PIA2, both the 2-factor and 3-factor interactions mentioned above were supported with both education*OPRM1 and education*OPRM1*HTTLPR being the top prediction models. In summary, all the 3 strategies converged on the education*OPRM1 interaction. Combination of education ≤12 years and OPRM1 A/A was shown to be a high risk factor for alcoholism by GMDR, which is consistent with the dendrogram illustrating synergy between education background and OPRM1. The synergistic interaction was further confirmed by dosage-effect response analysis of education*OPRM1 with logistic regression, which showed individuals with both 2 risk factors had higher risk for alcoholism than those with no or 1 risk factor. The education*OPRM1 interaction further underscores the importance of improving education level for alcoholism prevention in Mexican Americans. Polygenic disorders, such as alcoholism, are a result of the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Education*OPRM1 interaction found in this current study actually represents such an environment*gene interplay. The mechanism accounting for such an interaction may be the incomplete penetrance of genotypes. OPRM1 A/A has main effect on pathogenesis of alcoholism, but the expression of genetic effect depends on environment. Only when individuals have low education level, the pathogenic genetic effect can be expressed resulting in the occurrence of alcoholism. Another possibility is that high level education can improve the brain function, including function of reward system, so the pathogenic effect of reward gene variants may be masked. These hypotheses still need to be validated with functional studies. At the same time, the reason why only OPRM1 in the reward pathway interacts with education background still remains to be elucidated.

According to previous studies ([Bradley et al., 2005](#R11); [Smith et al., 2004](#R48)), 5-HTTLPR S allele results in decreased expression of 5-HTT and less reuptake of 5-HT, so more 5-HT will be degraded in the synaptic cleft. As a result, 5-HT in the neurotransmitter pool may not remain abundant and stable serotoninergic neurotransmission may not be maintained, breaking normal function of the reward system and increasing the risk for alcoholism. In our current study, HTTLPR was shown to be involved in the factor interaction by classification tree analysis, and the dendrogram indicated synergy between HTTLPR and OPRM1. Although the involvement of HTTLPR in the interaction was not supported by GMDR analysis, possible effect of HTTLPR on alcoholism still deserves further investigation with a larger sample size.

PIA2 program is designed to be highly sensitive at modest interactions. Even in absence of interacting factors, PIA2 will identify top scoring models, so observed interactions with PIA2 must be interpreted with caution and confirmed with alternative methods ([Mechanic et al., 2008](#R39)). In our current study, PIA2 indicated a top 4-factor model, which was not supported by classification tree and GMDR analysis, so the 4-factor interaction is considered as a false-positive result.

Main effects of and interactions among risk factors were detected with alcoholics of moderate or/and large MAXDRINKS. MAXDRINKS, which denotes the maximum number of drinks a person consumes in a 24-hour period, is an important phenotype used in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) study. Larger MAXDRINKS may reflect an increased tolerance for high levels of alcohol ([Edenberg, 2002](#R19)), so it is reasonable to take MAXDRINKS as an indicator of severity of alcoholism. For a polygenic disorder such as alcoholism, patients with severe forms of the disease always harbor more genetic and environmental risk factors, therefore, it is not surprising to detect main effect of and interaction among reward gene polymorphisms and environmental factors only in alcoholics who have the large MAXDRINKS.

The main effect and interaction of genetic factors identified in the current study might be race-specific and only exist in Mexican Americans. For other ethnic populations with high morbidity of alcoholism, the allele frequency of OPRM1 118G is very low in Africans (0.8 to 2.2%) (dbSNP), and the allele frequency of DRD2 −141C Del is as low as 2.1% in Europeans [[ALlele FREquency Database (ALFRED), 1999](#R1)]. Low allele frequency suggests a minor effect of these polymorphisms in pathogenesis of alcoholism in Africans and Europeans.

Although the current study might have the largest collection of Mexican Americans in the literature, given the nature of alcoholism as a polygenic disorder, the limited number of studied polymorphisms and participants might still be the limitation of the current study. Further validations from independent populations are necessary to confirm our findings. More genes in the reward pathways such as serotonin receptors, opioid receptor kappa 1, GABA receptor β1, dopamine transporter, dopamine receptor D4, etc. can be included in the interaction analysis to produce a more robust result. Alcoholics were stratified arbitrarily according to tertiles of MAXDRINKS in the current study, and the results will be more accurate if we define the severity of alcoholics with Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ) score. None of the strategies used for interaction analysis are perfect, and development of more powerful statistical tools will be critical for future studies. More importantly, findings of current study need to be verified with functional research.

In conclusion, our results suggest a main effect of education background, OPRM1 A118G, and DRD2 −141C Ins/Del as well as education*OPRM1 interaction in contribution to moderate and/or severe alcoholism in Mexican Americans. Functional relevance of these findings still needs to be explored.
