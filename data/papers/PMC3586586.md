## Abstract

**Aim:** 
The objective of this study was to determine the additional contribution of NQO1 and CYP4F2 genotypes to warfarin dose requirements across two racial groups after accounting for known clinical and genetic predictors.

**Patients & methods:** 
The following were assessed in a cohort of 260 African–Americans and 53 Hispanic–Americans: clinical data; NQO1 p.P187S (*1/*2); CYP2C9*2, *3, *5, *6, *8 and *11; CYP4F2 p.V433M; and VKORC1 c.-1639G>A genotypes.

**Results:** 
Both the CYP4F2 433M (0.23 vs 0.06; p < 0.05) and NQO1*2 (0.27 vs. 0.18; p < 0.05) allele frequencies were higher in Hispanic–Americans compared with African–Americans. Multiple regression analysis in the Hispanic–American cohort revealed that each CYP4F2 433M allele was associated with a 22% increase in warfarin maintenance dose (p = 0.019). Possession of the NQO1*2 allele was associated with a 34% increase in warfarin maintenance dose (p = 0.004), while adjusting for associated genetic (CYP2C9, CYP4F2 and VKORC1) and clinical factors. In this population, the inclusion of CYP4F2 and NQO1*2 genotypes improved the dose variability explained by the model from 0.58 to 0.68 (p = 0.001), a 17% relative improvement. By contrast, there was no association between CYP4F2 or NQO1*2 genotype and therapeutic warfarin dose in African–Americans after adjusting for known genetic and clinical predictors.

**Conclusion:** 
In our cohort of inner-city Hispanic–Americans, the CYP4F2 and NQO1*2 genotypes significantly contributed to warfarin dose requirements. If our findings are confirmed, they would suggest that inclusion of the CYP4F2 and NQO1*2 genotypes in warfarin dose prediction algorithms may improve the predictive ability of such algorithms in Hispanic–Americans.

### Aim

The objective of this study was to determine the additional contribution of *NQO1* and *CYP4F2* genotypes to warfarin dose requirements across two racial groups after accounting for known clinical and genetic predictors.

### Patients & methods

The following were assessed in a cohort of 260 African–Americans and 53 Hispanic–Americans: clinical data; *NQO1* p.P187S (**1*/**2*); *CYP2C9***2*, **3*, **5*, **6*, **8* and **11*; *CYP4F2* p.V433M; and *VKORC1* c.-1639G>A genotypes.

### Results

Both the *CYP4F2* 433M (0.23 vs 0.06; p < 0.05) and NQO1*2 (0.27 vs. 0.18; p < 0.05) allele frequencies were higher in Hispanic–Americans compared with African–Americans. Multiple regression analysis in the Hispanic–American cohort revealed that each *CYP4F2* 433M allele was associated with a 22% increase in warfarin maintenance dose (p = 0.019). Possession of the *NQO1***2* allele was associated with a 34% increase in warfarin maintenance dose (p = 0.004), while adjusting for associated genetic (*CYP2C9, CYP4F2* and *VKORC1*) and clinical factors. In this population, the inclusion of *CYP4F2* and *NQO1***2* genotypes improved the dose variability explained by the model from 0.58 to 0.68 (p = 0.001), a 17% relative improvement. By contrast, there was no association between *CYP4F2* or *NQO1***2* genotype and therapeutic warfarin dose in African–Americans after adjusting for known genetic and clinical predictors.

### Conclusion

In our cohort of inner-city Hispanic–Americans, the *CYP4F2* and *NQO1***2* genotypes significantly contributed to warfarin dose requirements. If our findings are confirmed, they would suggest that inclusion of the *CYP4F2* and *NQO1***2* genotypes in warfarin dose prediction algorithms may improve the predictive ability of such algorithms in Hispanic–Americans.

## Patients & methods

### Study population & data collection

The patient population and procedures have been previously described [[20](#R20),[21](#R21)]. Briefly, adult patients on a stable warfarin dose, defined as the same dose for at least three consecutive clinic visits with an average international Normalized Ratio (INR) within therapeutic range, were enrolled from the University of Illinois Hospital (IL, USA) and Health Sciences System Antithrombosis Clinic (IL, USA). Only patients who self-identified as African–American or Hispanic–American were included. Patients with a history of liver dysfunction or serum transaminase levels greater than three-times the upper limit of normal were excluded.

After obtaining written informed consent and authorization for medical record review, a buccal cell or venous blood sample was obtained for genetic analysis, as previously described [[22](#R22)]. Clinical data and social history were assessed via interview and review of the electronic medical record. The local institutional review board approved this study.

### Genotyping & ancestry estimation

Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells or lymphocytes, and the *NQO1* rs1800566 (P187S; **2*), *CYP2C9* rs1799853 (p.R144C; **2*), rs1057910 (p.I359L; **3*), rs28371686 (p.D360E; **5*), rs9332131 (273frameshift; **6*), rs7900194 (p.R150H; **8*) and rs28371685 (p. R335W; **11*), and *CYP4F2* rs2108622 (p.V433M) and *VKORC1* rs9923231 (c.-1639G>A) genotypes were determined, as previously described [[20](#R20),[23](#R23),[24](#R24)]. Individual genetic ancestry was determined for each person using 105 autosomal DNA ancestry informative markers for west African, Native American and European–American genetic ancestry using published methods [[25](#R25)–[27](#R27)]. Each participant was then scored from 0 to 100% for individual ancestry estimates of west African, Native American and European ancestry.

### Data analysis

Average INR was calculated by averaging INR values from the three clinic visits when the warfarin dose was stable. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested by χ^2^ analysis. Median daily warfarin dose was compared between genotype groups using the Mann–Whitney U test or the Kruskal–Wallis test.

The therapeutic warfarin dose was log transformed (natural log) prior to linear regression analysis to produce a more normal distribution of regression residuals. Pearson's correlations, unpaired t-test and χ^2^ tests were used to identify clinical factors associated with warfarin maintenance dose. Variables potentially associated with warfarin dose requirements (p < 0.10) were included in the multivariate linear regression model.

Multivariate linear regression permitted tests for the additional effect of *NQO1***2* and *CYP4F2* genotypes on warfarin dose requirements while holding clinical and well-established genetic factors constant as well as adjusting for genetic ancestry. A dominant model was used for *CYP2C9* genotypes, with variant allele carriers coded as `1' and non carriers coded as `0', and an additive model was used for *CYP4F2* V433M and *VKORC1* -1639G>A, with the number of variant alleles coded 0, 1 or 2, as previously described [[4](#R4),[14](#R14),[20](#R20)]. The data for *NQO1* were analyzed using both a dominant and additive model, and the model providing the most robust fit for the data and requiring the least amount of assumptions was selected.

Clinical variables were retained in the model if they achieved statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05) or were marginally significant (0.05 < p ≤ 0.10) with strong biological plausibility. Next, *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* genotypes were added to the model, followed by *CYP4F2, NQO1* and genetic ancestry. The percentage of warfarin dose variability explained by a model including clinical variables plus *CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2* and *NQO1* genotypes was compared with the variability explained by a model containing clinical factors only, and a model containing clinical factors plus *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* genotypes only. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS^®^ software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, NC, USA).

## Results

A total of 313 patients were enrolled, including 260 African–Americans and 53 Hispanic–Americans. The majority of Hispanic patients (89%) were of Mexican descent. [Table 1](#T1) displays the characteristics of the study participants. African–Americans were of larger body size, more likely to have venous thromboembolism and less likely to have a history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation or aspirin use. Therapeutic warfarin dose and average INR were significantly higher in African–Americans compared with Hispanic–Americans (p < 0.001). Other characteristics were similar between racial groups.

Genotype data were missing for one subject for *CYP2C9***8*, one subject for *VKORC1* -1639G>A, eight subjects for *CYP2C9***6* and two subjects for *CYP4F2* p.V433M, owing to poor sample quality. All other genotype data were complete. No genotype deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. There were significant differences in allele frequencies by self-reported race ([Table 2](#T2)), with higher frequencies of the *CYP2C9***2*, *CYP2C9***3*, *CYP4F2* 433M, *VKORC1* -1639A and *NQO1***2* alleles in Hispanic–Americans compared with African–Americans. The *NQO1***2* allele frequency observed in our Hispanic cohort was also higher than reported in Europeans [[101](#R47)].

### Bivariate analysis between genotype & warfarin dosage

As previously reported, *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* genotypes were significantly associated with warfarin dose requirements in both Hispanic–Americans and African–Americans ([Table 3](#T3)) [[20](#R20),[21](#R21)]. The *CYP4F2* genotype was associated with warfarin dose in Hispanic–Americans but not in African–Americans. There was no association between the *NQO1***2* genotype and warfarin dose requirements in either race by bivariate analysis.

### Multivariate linear regression analysis of association between NQO1 & CYP4F2 & warfarin dose

Clinical variables found on bivariate regression analysis to be potentially associated with log therapeutic warfarin dose in both self-reported racial groups were age, body surface area, history of venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation or flutter. History of stroke, hypertension, coronary artery disease, aspirin use and simvastatin use were associated with warfarin dose requirements in African–Americans only.

[Tables 4](#T4) & [5](#T5) display the results of the multiple regression models in the African–American and Hispanic–American cohorts, respectively. For the *NQO1* genotype, both a dominant and additive model resulted in significant associations between genotype and therapeutic warfarin dose in the regression model. However, the dominant model provided the most robust fit and the fewest assumptions and was therefore used. [Table 4](#T4) demonstrates that the inclusion of *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* genotypes into the clinical model increased the explained variance in warfarin dose for African–Americans. However, there was no further improvement in the model with the addition of *CYP4F2* or *NQO1***2* genotype (models 3 and 4). For Hispanic–Americans, [Table 5](#T5) shows that the inclusion of *CYP4F2* improved the dose variability explained by the model from 0.58 to 0.63 (p = 0.02), and *NQO1***2* further improved the dose variability explained to 0.68 (p = 0.004). This equated to a 17% relative improvement in explanatory power (adjusted R^2^) of therapeutic warfarin dose compared with model 2 (p < 0.001). Specifically, based on the regression coefficient, each *CYP4F2* 433M allele was associated with a 22% increase in warfarin maintenance dose, and possession of a *NQO1***2* allele was associated with a 34% (p = 0.001) increase in therapeutic warfarin dose requirements, while holding clinical and genetic predictors constant. Furthermore, model 4 in Hispanic–American explained 32% more variance in therapeutic warfarin dose than a similar model in African–Americans. After adjustment for Native American ancestry in model 5 in the Hispanic group, the explained variance increased to 0.70, although this was not significantly different from model 4. Adjusting for west African ancestry in self-reported African–Americans neither increased the variance explained nor did it significantly impact any of the β-coefficients in model 4.

It is reasonable to ask if the regression coefficients for the *NQO1***2* and *CYP4F2* variants are different between the African–American and Hispanic–American race groups. Therefore, we ran a test on the equality of the coefficients using an interaction product term in a multivariate regression model containing the total population with an indicator variable for race group. Both product terms for the interaction between the *NQO1***2* and *CYP4F2* variants with race and the race indicator variable were statistically significant (p < 0.05 for both interaction terms). This confirms there is an interaction between the effect of carrying *NQO1***2* and *CYP4F2* variants on warfarin dose by race.

## Discussion

African–Americans and, to a greater extent, Hispanic–Americans, are under-represented in warfarin pharmacogenetic studies. In fact, this is one of the first studies to report on warfarin pharmacogenetics in Hispanic–Americans. In previous studies, we found that *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* provide important contributions to understanding warfarin dose variability in both African–American and Hispanic–American populations [[20](#R20),[21](#R21)]. We also found that the multi-ethnic pharmacogenetic warfarin dosing algorithm by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) performed as well in Hispanic–Americans as has been previously reported in populations of European descent [[21](#R21)], whereas there is evidence of poorer performance of the IWPC algorithm in those of African descent [[28](#R28)]. Importantly, a significant portion of the dose variability in both Hispanic–American and African–American populations remains unexplained by models including clinical factors as well as the *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* genotypes [[20](#R20),[21](#R21)]. The *CYP4F2* genotype has been associated with warfarin dose requirements in Caucasians and Asians, but not in African–Americans or Egyptians [[13](#R13)–[16](#R16),[29](#R29)]. Its contribution to warfarin dose variability in Hispanic–Americans has not been previously reported. While the *NQO1* genotype has been examined for its contribution to acenocoumarol dose variability in Caucasians, in whom no association was found, it has not been adequately examined in other ethnic groups [[30](#R30)].

Our key finding from this study is that *CYP4F2* and *NQO1***2* genotypes were significantly associated with therapeutic warfarin dose in Hispanic–Americans when holding known associated clinical and genetic predictors constant. However, neither contributed to warfarin dose requirements in African–Americans. The multivariate regression model in Hispanic–Americans revealed that carrying a *NQO1*2* variant increased therapeutic warfarin dose by 34%, each *CYP4F2* variant increased dose requirements by 22% and consideration of clinical and genetic factors, including *CYP4F2* and *NQO1*, explained 68% of the variance in therapeutic warfarin dose; a 17% improvement over a model without *CYP4F2* or *NQO1***2* genotype. Based on the median therapeutic dose of 4.5 mg/day observed in our Hispanic–American patients, the effect of carrying a *NQO1***2* variant equates to nearly a 2-mg/day higher warfarin dose requirement. Our data in Hispanic–Americans suggest each *CYP4F2* variant is associated with an approximately 1-mg/day higher therapeutic warfarin dose requirement, which is similar to data elucidated by Caldwell and coworkers for a mostly Caucasian cohort [[14](#R14)]. It is also important to note the large difference in R^2^ for model 4 between the Hispanic–American and African–American groups. Essentially the same predictor variables explained nearly twice the variance in Hispanic–Americans compared with African–Americans. This further emphasizes the heterogeneity of treatment effect by ancestry and specifically highlights ancestry differences in the explanatory power of warfarin dose prediction models.

Hispanic–Americans are one of the largest and fastest growing minority groups in the USA and, to date, have been essentially absent in the largest warfarin pharmacogenetic data sets [[4](#R4),[21](#R21),102]. Given that nearly 4% have a history of atrial fibrillation, and 3% have a history of ischemic stroke, the number of Hispanic–Americans with indications for warfarin is substantial [[31](#R31),[32](#R32)]. Therefore, identifying factors that are uniquely associated with warfarin dose in Hispanic–Americans is critical to improving care in this population. Two previous studies have examined warfarin pharmacogenetics in other Hispanic–American populations [[33](#R33)]. Compared with Hispanic–Americans of mostly Mexican descent in the current study, higher frequencies of the *CYP2C9***2* (19%) and *VKORC1* -1639A (41%) alleles were reported in a Puerto Rican population [[33](#R33),[34](#R34)]. The percentage of Native American ancestry was higher in the current study than previously reported in Puerto Ricans, and in line with that reported in Mexican–Mestizos, potentially accounting for the observed differences in allele frequencies among Hispanic–American populations [[35](#R35),[36](#R36)]. However, importantly, both the current study and previous studies in other Hispanic–American populations found significant reductions in the warfarin maintenance dose with *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* variants [[33](#R33),[34](#R34)]. Our study is unique in that it examined additional variants beyond those found in *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1*.

Our findings with *CYP4F2* are consistent with previous *in vitro* data demonstrating decreased enzyme activity with the 433M allele and previous association studies showing increased dose requirements in Caucasians with this allele [[14](#R14),[15](#R15)] However, our findings with *NQO1* are inconsistent with what might be expected. The *NQO1***2* genotype has been associated with decreased circulating clotting factor levels in patients in antithrombosis clinics in The Netherlands [[11](#R11)] Furthermore, rats carrying the *NQO1***2* variant were shown to have decreased coagulation ability compared with wild-type rats [[37](#R37)]. Furthermore, in Taiwanese subjects, the *NQO1***2* genotype was associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke [[12](#R12)]. Together, these data suggest that *NQO1***2* carriers have less circulating clotting factors and would therefore theoretically require less warfarin to maintain a therapeutic INR. This is in contrast to our finding of higher warfarin dose requirements in Hispanic–Americans carrying a *NQO1***2* (loss-of-function) variant. One possible explanation is that the *NQO1***2* variant is not the actual variant underlying the observed association with dose requirements. Rather, it may be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional locus associated with higher doses in Hispanic–Americans. This is supported by previous data suggesting a lack of association between *NQO1***2* genotype and warfarin dose requirements in African-Americans and Caucasians [[30](#R30)]. *NQO1*2* genotype was not associated with either warfarin dose or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic response to warfarin in previously described, predominantly non-Hispanic, Caucasian populations, as well as in our African–American cohort [[30](#R30)]. Therefore, it is possible that *NQO1***2* is not in linkage with a causative SNP in other race/ethnic groups [[30](#R30),[38](#R38)]. However, this is speculative and requires exploration.

Ancestral informative marker testing revealed an average Native American ancestry of 38% among our Hispanic–American population. By comparison, European–Americans reportedly have <10% Native American ancestry [[39](#R39)]. Genetic ancestry is a useful tool to control for genetic differences within heterogeneous populations such as Hispanic-American and African–Americans. This is especially the case for Hispanic–Americans who, depending on geographic origin, may possess a significant proportion of Native American (Mexican–American) or west African (Puerto Rican) genetic ancestry [[40](#R40)]. Given ancestral differences in allele frequencies and haplotype distribution, genetic studies limited to non- Hispanic whites may fail to detect variants predictive of dose in those of Hispanic ethnicity, who share a large portion of genetic architecture with Native Americans. In particular, genome-wide association studies assessing genetic determinants of warfarin dose requirements have been limited to European, Asian and, most recently, African populations [[41](#R41)–[44](#R44)]. Thus, whether variants beyond those identified in other populations are important for informing warfarin dose requirements in patients with Native American ancestry is unknown. Since the percentage of Native American ancestry varies among Hispanic–Americans depending on region of origin, this may lead to variability in genetic contributions to warfarin dose requirements across the Hispanic populations. For example, the *VKORC1* -1639G>A variant explains 30% of the variability in warfarin dose requirements among Mexican–Americans, but only 11% among Hispanic–Americans from Columbia, South America [[21](#R21),[34](#R34)]. Therefore, it is important to identify variants of importance for different Hispanic populations.

Our sample size for Hispanic–Americans was relatively small and confined to those of Mexican descent and, thus, limits generalizability. As such, while we demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant association between *CYP4F2* and *NQO1***2* genotypes and therapeutic warfarin dose, our findings require confirmation in other Hispanic populations. Another limitation is that we did not assess dietary vita-min K, which can contribute to variation in warfarin dose. Although we only explored one *NQO1* variant, the **2* allele is reportedly more common than other *NQO1* variant alleles [[45](#R45),[46](#R46)].

In summary, *CYP4F2* and *NQO1* genotypes did not impact warfarin dose requirements in our African–American cohort, even after controlling for clinical factors and genotypes associated with warfarin maintenance dose. However, in our cohort of inner-city Hispanic–Americans, both *CYP4F2* and *NQO1* were significantly associated with warfarin dose requirements, when holding clinical and genetic predictors constant. If our findings are confirmed, they would suggest that inclusion of *CYP4F2* and *NQO1***2* genotypes in warfarin dosing algorithms may improve the predictive ability of such algorithms in self-reported Hispanic–Americans of Mexican descent. Whether these genotypes are important for other Hispanic populations remains to be determined.

## Future perspective

African–Americans, and especially Hispanic–Americans, remain under-represented in pharmacogenetic studies, including those involving warfarin. Our data support the need to investigate race-specific warfarin dose prediction models, which may provide more accurate dosing in under-represented patients. Moving forward, developing warfarin dose predication equations that take ancestry in concert with clinical and genetic characteristics into account may improve dose prescribing in under-represented populations.
