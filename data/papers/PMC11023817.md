## Abstract

**SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:** 
Bupropion, used for depression, obesity, and smoking cessation, undergoes metabolic bioactivation, with incompletely elucidated interindividual variability. We evaluated cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6, CYP2C19 and P450 oxidoreductase genetic variants and steady-state bupropion and metabolite enantiomers disposition. Both enantiomers hydroxylation was lower in CYP2B6*6 and CYP2B6 516G>T carriers, with greater bupropion and lesser hydroxybupropion plasma concentrations. CYP2C19 polymorphisms did not affect bupropion or hydroxybupropion but did influence minor 4’-hydroxylation of bupropion and primary metabolites. CYP2B6 variants affect steady-state bupropion bioactivation, which may influence therapeutic outcomes.

### SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT

Bupropion, used for depression, obesity, and smoking cessation, undergoes metabolic bioactivation, with incompletely elucidated interindividual variability. We evaluated cytochrome P450 (CYP) *2B6*, *CYP2C19* and *P450 oxidoreductase* genetic variants and steady-state bupropion and metabolite enantiomers disposition. Both enantiomers hydroxylation was lower in *CYP2B6*6* and *CYP2B6* 516G>T carriers, with greater bupropion and lesser hydroxybupropion plasma concentrations. *CYP2C19* polymorphisms did not affect bupropion or hydroxybupropion but did influence minor 4’-hydroxylation of bupropion and primary metabolites. *CYP2B6* variants affect steady-state bupropion bioactivation, which may influence therapeutic outcomes.

## Introduction

Bupropion is US Food and Drug Administration-approved for treating major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and aiding smoking cessation in adults, alone or in combination with other drugs ([Patel et al., 2016](#B39); [Hajizadeh et al., 2023](#B17)). It is also used for obesity, cocaine or amphetamine abuse, sexual dysfunction, and chronic pain in adults and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults and children ([Kharasch et al., 2020](#B25)). Bupropion is available in immediate-, sustained-, and extended-release oral formulations. It is a racemic mixture, extensively (>99%) metabolized to the three main primary metabolites (two isomers each), hydroxybupropion, erythrohydrobupropion, and threohydrobupropion, and the minor metabolite 4’-hydroxybupropion, and several secondary metabolites, including glucuronides ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Bupropion is in part a prodrug because the major metabolites, most notably hydroxybupropion, are pharmacologically active and circulate in concentrations an order of magnitude greater than bupropion ([Costa et al., 2019](#B9)).

The importance of bupropion and metabolite stereoselectivity and stereoselective metabolism has been increasingly recognized ([Dash et al., 2018](#B10)). Prior in vitro studies established that human bupropion t-butyl hydroxylation is stereoselective ([Xu et al., 2007](#B48); [Coles and Kharasch, 2008](#B7); [Sager et al., 2016b](#B42); [Wang et al., 2020](#B44); [Bamfo et al., 2023](#B1)), as is the keto reduction of bupropion to erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion by hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and other carbonyl reductases ([Molnari and Myers, 2012](#B37); [Meyer et al., 2013](#B36); [Connarn et al., 2015](#B8); [Bamfo et al., 2023](#B1)). Metabolism in vitro to the more recently identified metabolite 4’-hydroxybupropion, and secondary metabolites 4’-hydroxy-erythrohydrobupropion and 4’-hydroxy-threohydrobupropion is also stereoselective ([Sager et al., 2016a](#B41),b). Prior human in vivo investigations showed that single-dose ([Kharasch et al., 2008](#B24); [Masters et al., 2016](#B35); [Gufford et al., 2022](#B16)) and steady-state ([Kharasch et al., 2020](#B25)) bupropion disposition in humans is also stereoselective. The clinical importance of metabolite formation has been recognized for smoking cessation and antidepressant therapy ([Lee et al., 2007](#B30); [Zhu et al., 2012](#B50); [Laib et al., 2014](#B29)).

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms are important in human bupropion metabolism. Human bupropion t-butyl hydroxylation to *R,R*- and *S,S*-hydroxybupropion is catalyzed nearly exclusively by CYP2B6 ([Faucette et al., 2000](#B14); [Coles and Kharasch, 2008](#B7)). The *CYP2B6* gene is highly polymorphic, with at least 48 allelic variants identified ([www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA123](http://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA123)), of which several are common, predominant in ethnic populations, and clinically significant. *CYP2B6* polymorphisms influence human in vitro bupropion hydroxylation ([Wang et al., 2020](#B44)). *CYP2B6* polymorphisms influence human in vivo hydroxylation of single-dose bupropion racemate ([Kirchheiner et al., 2003](#B28); [Chung et al., 2011](#B6); [Gao et al., 2016](#B15); [Lv et al., 2016](#B32); [Ma et al., 2018](#B33); [Eum et al., 2022](#B13)) and single-dose bupropion enantiomers ([Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23); [Gufford et al., 2022](#B16)). Such genetic variability is clinically significant, as *CYP2B6* polymorphisms affecting hydroxybupropion formation have been associated with differences in smoking cessation outcomes ([Lee et al., 2007](#B30); [Zhu et al., 2012](#B50); [El-Boraie and Tyndale, 2021](#B12)). CYP2C19 can also metabolize bupropion in vitro ([Chen et al., 2010](#B5)). Specifically, human 4’-hydroxylation of bupropion, erythrohydrobupropion, and threohydrobupropion in vitro is catalyzed exclusively by CYP2C19 ([Chen et al., 2010](#B5); [Sager et al., 2016b](#B42)). CYP2C19 may also be a minor contributor to bupropion t-butyl hydroxylation in vitro ([Sager et al., 2016b](#B42)). The *CYP2C19* gene is highly polymorphic, with at least 37 allelic variants identified ([https://www.pharmvar.org/gene/CYP2C19](https://www.pharmvar.org/gene/CYP2C19)), of which three are common and clinically significant ([Ionova et al., 2020](#B22)). *CYP2C19* genetic variants have been associated with altered pharmacokinetics of bupropion racemate but not with smoking cessation outcomes ([Zhu et al., 2014](#B51)).

In major depressive disorder, treatment guided by pharmacogenetic testing was associated with improved response and remission rates, and time to clinical remission and response ([Wang et al., 2023](#B46)). Guidelines for *CYP2B6* and *CYP2C19* pharmacogenetically-guided antidepressant therapy for drugs other than bupropion have been published ([Bousman et al., 2023](#B4)). A comprehensive evaluation of the influence of metabolizing enzyme genetic variants on steady-state disposition of bupropion and assessment of stereoselectivity is not available. This present investigation is a secondary analysis of data from a previous clinical trial ([Kharasch et al., 2019](#B26), [2020](#B25)), which now evaluates the influence of *CYP2B6*, *CYP2C19*, and *cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase* (POR) single nucleotide variants, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of oral bupropion and metabolites.

## Methods

This investigation is a follow-up pharmacogenetic analysis of a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, 4-period, balanced, single-center crossover study comparing bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence of three bupropion XL 300 mg generics to brand Wellbutrin XL 300 mg bupropion in patients being treated for major depression (clinicaltrials.gov, [NCT02209597](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02209597)) ([Kharasch et al., 2019](#B26), [2020](#B25)). It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration Research Involving Human Subjects Committee and the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board and registered ([NCT02209597](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02209597)). All subjects provided written, informed consent. Inclusion criteria included men and women 18–75 years, with major depressive disorder in remission, and taking bupropion XL 300 mg once daily for ≥4 months. Major exclusions included hepatic or renal disease, drugs influencing CYP2B6, cognitive impairment, bipolar or psychotic disorder, recent abuse of alcohol or other substances, and suicidal ideation. Participants were enrolled June 2014 to January 2016, with follow-up completed August 2016.

This manuscript reports the results of participant treatment with brand bupropion XL 300 mg (Valeant Pharmaceuticals Wellbutrin; NDC 64455-731). Subjects underwent pharmacokinetic evaluation after an overnight fast 10–20 days after starting Valeant Pharmaceuticals Wellbutrin. Venous blood samples intermittently and all urine was collected for 24 hours as described ([Kharasch et al., 2020](#B25)).

Plasma bupropion and metabolites hydroxybupropion, erythrohydrobupropion, and threohydrobupropion, and urine bupropion, hydroxybupropion, erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, 4′-hydroxybupropion, 4′-hydroxy-erythrohydrobupropion, 4′-hydroxy-threohydrobupropion, and hydroxybupropion, erythrohydrobupropion, and threohydrobupropion glucuronides were quantified by a validated stereoselective liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay ([Kharasch et al., 2020](#B25)). Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using noncompartmental methods (Phoenix; Pharsight, Mountain View, CA), assuming complete absorption ([Kharasch et al., 2020](#B25)).

Genetic polymorphisms in *CYP2B6, CYP2C19*, and *P450 oxidoreductase* alleles were determined in blood from 67 participants. Tested were the *CYP2B6* polymorphisms 516G>T (rs3745274), 785A>G (rs2279343), 983T>C (rs28399499), and 1459C>T (rs3211371) to permit detection of *CYP2B6*1,*4,*6,*7,*9,*16,* and **18* alleles ([Kharasch et al., 2015](#B27); [Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23)) (although *CYP2B6*16* has since been consolidated into *CYP2B6*18* because 983T>C is the core variant ([Desta et al., 2021](#B11)), but no *CYP2B6*16* carriers were identified in our cohort). *CYP2C19* variants were measured to assess 618G>A (rs4244285, *CYP2C19*2*), 636G>A (4986893, *CYP2C19*3*) and 806C>T (rs12248560, *CYP2C19*17*) variants as described ([Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23)). CYP2C19 phenotypes were based on diplotypes: ultra-rapid metabolizers (**17*17*), rapid metabolizer (**1/*17*), normal metabolizer (**1/*1*), intermediate metabolizer (**1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*17, *3/*17*), and poor metabolizers (**2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3*) ([Hicks et al., 2017](#B19)). POR variants assessed were 859G>C (rs121912974, *POR*5*), 541T>G (rs72552771, *POR*8*), 1508C>T (rs1057868, *POR*28*), and intron g.6593 A>G (rs2868177), and the rs2868177 GC-rs1057868 GT diplotype ([Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23); [Wang et al., 2022](#B45)). All genotyping was performed by the Washington University in St. Louis Genome Technology Access Center.

Data are reported as mean ± S.D. for normally distributed data, or the median (25^th^–75^th^ percentile). Groups were compared by ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 10. A full protocol is available in the Supplemental Material to the initial trial results ([Kharasch et al., 2019](#B26)).

## Results

The full crossover study cohort was (median, interquartile range) 47 years (37–57) and 76 kg (63–94), with 53 women (76%), and 64 whites, five African Americans, and one Asian, as reported previously ([Kharasch et al., 2019](#B26)). Of these 70 subjects, 68 received Valeant Wellbutrin brand bupropion; and genetic data were available for 67 of these subjects. The frequency of *CYP2B6* diplotypes in the cohort ([Table 1](#T1)) was similar to that reported previously ([https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/frequency/CYP2B6_frequency_table.xlsx](https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/frequency/CYP2B6_frequency_table.xlsx)) and the frequency of *CYP2C19* phenotypes ([Table 1](#T1)) was similar to that reported previously ([https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/frequency/CYP2C19_frequency_table.xlsx](https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/frequency/CYP2C19_frequency_table.xlsx)), except that the percentage of rapid metabolizers was greater (31% versus 14%) and that of normal metabolizers was less (39% versus 63%).

### Bupropion Disposition and CYP2B6 Genotypes

Steady-state plasma bupropion and hydroxybupropion racemate and enantiomer concentrations are shown in [Fig. 2](#F2) for *CYP2B*6**1/*1* wild types, *CYP2B6*6* carriers, and *CYP2B6*1/*4*, and *CYP2B6*1/*5* genotypes. Not shown are *CYP2B6*1/*7* and *CYP2B6*5/*5* genotypes. Subject numbers for each group are in [Table 1](#T1). [Fig. 3](#F3) shows only genotype groups *CYP2B*6**1/*1, CYP2B1*6,* and *CYP2B6*6* for clarity. The *CYP2B6*6* allele frequency was consistent with population frequencies (CYP2B6 frequency table, [https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2b6RefMaterials](https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2b6RefMaterials)). Pharmacokinetic parameters for all *CYP2B* genotypes are provided in [Table 1](#T1) for plasma and in [Table 2](#T2) for urine. Disposition was highly stereoselective, as observed previously for single-dose ([Kharasch et al., 2008](#B24); [Masters et al., 2016](#B35); [Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23); [Gufford et al., 2022](#B16)) and steady-state ([Kharasch et al., 2020](#B25)) bupropion.

Influence of CYP2B6 genotype on plasma bupropion disposition. Results are for CYP2B6*1/*1, CYP2B6*1/*6, and CYP2B6*6/*6 genotypes only. Each data point is the mean ± S.D. Some S.D. are omitted for clarity.

Carriers of the *CYP2B6*6* variant generally had different bupropion disposition, with higher bupropion and lesser hydroxybupropion plasma exposure, compared with reference *CYP2B6*1*1* participants. Plasma area under the curve (AUC) was 790 (704, 906), 929 (801, 1120) and 1265 (1204, 1337) hr*ng/ml for *rac*-bupropion, 679 (583, 764), 804 (672, 944) and 1024 (924, 1148) for *R*-bupropion, and 120 (105, 144), 145 (125, 176), and 204 (195, 213) for *S*-bupropion, in *CYP2B6*1/*1*, *CYP2B6*1/*6*, and *CYP2B6*6/*6* participants, respectively. Plasma AUC was 23.6 (16.6, 26.8), 15.9 (12.9, 23.2), and 20.1 (17.0, 22.2) hr**µ*g/ml for *rac*-hydroxybupropion, 23.0 (16.1, 26.4), 15.6 (12.6, 22.6), and 19.4 (16.6, 21.3) for *R,R*-hydroxybupropion, and 0.52 (0.44, 0.62), 0.37 (0.32, 0.62), and 0.66 (0.42, 0.94) for *S,S*-hydroxybupropion, in *CYP2B6*1/*1*, *CYP2B6*1/*6*, and *CYP2B6*6/*6* participants, respectively. *CYP2B6*6* carriers had lower bupropion hydroxylation compared with *CYP2B6*1* participants, and *CYP2B6*6* homozygotes had lower *S*-bupropion apparent oral clearance ([Table 1](#T1)). *CYP2B6* genotype had no influence on bupropion renal clearance ([Table 2](#T2)). Bupropion hydroxylation, evaluated by the plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratio, was significantly (one-third) less in *CYP2B6*1/*6* compared with *CYP2B6*1/*1* subjects for the racemate and both *R,R*- and *S,S*-hydroxybupropion. Bupropion hydroxylation, evaluated by urine hydroxybupropion formation clearance, was less in *CYP2B6*6* carriers (one-quarter to one-half that), compared with *CYP2B6*1/*1* subjects, for both *R,R*- and *S,S*-hydroxybupropion. The difference in bupropion hydroxylation in *CYP2B6*1/6* versus *CYP2B6*1/1* subjects was comparable for *R-* and *S-*bupropion (e.g., plasma AUCs for *R,R*- and *S,S-*hydroxybupropion in *CYP2B6*1/6* subjects were both 68–70% of AUCs in *CYP2B6*1/1* subjects, as occurred also for plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios and urine hydroxybupropion formation clearances).

*CYP2B6*6* (516G>T, rs3745274 and 785A>G, rs2279343) is the most common and most extensively studied *CYP2B6* variant, and elicits lower protein expression due to the 516G>T single nucleotide variant causing an amino acid change and aberrant splicing ([Hofmann et al., 2008](#B20)). The 516G>T single nucleotide variant is however also found in numerous other *CYP2B6* alleles, and is considered a canonical decreased function variant. Therefore the influence of the 516G>T single nucleotide variant alone was also assessed. Steady-state plasma bupropion and hydroxybupropion racemate and enantiomer concentrations are shown in [Fig. 4](#F4) for *CYP2B6* 516GG, GT and TT genotypes. 516T carriers generally had greater bupropion and lesser hydroxybupropion plasma exposure, compared with non-carriers. Plasma AUC was 791 (674, 900), 929 (801, 1120 and 1217 (1128, 1340) hr*ng/mL for *rac*-bupropion, 677 (567, 763), 804 (672, 944) and 1024 (924, 1148) for *R*-bupropion, and 117 (98, 145), 145 (125, 176) and 204 (195, 213) for *S*-bupropion in *CYP2B6* 516GG, GT and TT participants, respectively. Plasma AUC was 22.8 (17.8, 26.2), 15.9 (12.9, 23.2) and 20.1 (17.0, 22.2) hr**µ*g/ml for *rac*-hydroxybupropion, 22.3 (17.3, 25.6), 15.6 (12.6, 22.6) and 19.4 (16.6, 21.3) for *R,R*-hydroxybupropion, and 0.52 (0.43, 0.62), 0.37 (0.32, 0.62) and 0.66 (0.42, 0.94) for *S,S*-hydroxybupropion, in *CYP2B6* 516GG, GT and TT participants, respectively. Heterozygous and homozygous 516G>T carriers generally had lower bupropion racemate and enantiomer apparent oral clearances, lower racemate and enantiomer hydroxybupropion/bupropion plasma AUC ratios, and lower hydroxybupropion formation clearances compared with non-carriers ([Tables 1](#T1) and [2](#T2)). Bupropion hydroxylation, in 516T carriers compared with 516GG genotypes, was one-third less when evaluated by plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios, and less than half when evaluated by hydroxybupropion formation clearances. Plasma AUCs for *R,R*- versus *S,S-*hydroxybupropion were comparably lower (both were about 70% of AUCs in 516GG subjects).

Influence of the CYP2B6 516G>T single nucleotide variant on plasma bupropion disposition. Each data point is the mean ± S.D. Some S.D. are omitted for clarity.

*CYP2B6* polymorphism also influenced bupropion metabolism via pathways not associated with CYP2B6. Urine formation clearances of 1*S*,2*R*-erythrohydrobupropion, 1*R*,2*S*-erythrohydrobupropion, 1*R*,2*R*-threohydrobupropion, and 1*S*,2*S*-threohydrobupropion were all significantly lower in 516G>T carriers, as were those of 4-hydroxybupropion and 4-hydroxy(erythro- and threo-hydrobupropion).

### Bupropion Disposition and CYP2C19 Genotypes

Steady-state plasma bupropion and metabolite racemate and enantiomer concentrations are shown in [Fig. 5](#F5) for subjects based on *CYP2C19* metabolizer status. The allelic composition was *CYP2C19*1/*1* (*n* = 26,) **1/*2* (*n* = 12), **2/*2* (*n* = 3), **1/*17* (*n* = 21), **17/*17* (*n* = 2), and **2/*17* (*n* = 3) and was generally consistent with population frequencies (CYP2C19 frequency table, [https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2c19RefMaterials](https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2c19RefMaterials)) ([Ionova et al., 2020](#B22)). Pharmacokinetic parameters for all *CYP2C19* metabolizer phenotypes are provided in [Table 1](#T1) for plasma and in [Table 2](#T2) for urine.

Influence of CYP2C19 genotype on plasma bupropion disposition. Patients were grouped into normal, intermediate, poor, rapid, and ultrarapid metabolizer status. Each data point is the mean ± S.D. Some S.D. are omitted for clarity. Numbers of subjects in each group are shown in Table 1.

*CYP2C19* phenotype had no influence on bupropion enantiomers’ apparent oral clearance or renal clearance, and also had no influence on bupropion hydroxylation, based on enantiomers plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios (not shown) or urine hydroxybupropion formation clearances. The plasma racemic threohydrobupropion/racemic bupropion AUC ratio was greater in *CYP2C19* intermediate and poor metabolizers, due mainly to a greater 1*S*,2*S*-threohydrobupropion/*S*-bupropion AUC ratio. Formation clearance of 4-hydroxy(erythro- and threo-hydrobupropion) was also significantly less in *CYP2C19* poor metabolizers. These were not greater in ultrarapid metabolizers.

### Bupropion Disposition and POR Genotypes

Subjects were genotyped for *POR*1, POR*5, POR*8,* and *POR*28,* for the 6593A>G intron variant, and the rs2868177 GC-rs1057868 GT diplotype. The allelic compositions are shown in [Tables 1](#T1) and [2](#T2) and were consistent with reported population frequencies. Only *POR*28* carriers were identified; there were no *POR*5* or *POR*8* carriers identified. There were only three subjects with rs2868177 GC-rs1057868 GT diplotypes, so this variant was not analyzed further. [Fig. 6](#F6) shows steady-state plasma bupropion and hydroxybupropion racemate and enantiomer concentrations for the *POR**28 polymorphism and for the 6593A>G intron variant, and pharmacokinetic parameters are provided in [Tables 1](#T1) and [2](#T2).

Influence of POR genotype on plasma bupropion disposition. Each data point is the mean ± S.D. Some S.D. are omitted for clarity. Numbers of subjects in each group are shown in Table 1. The first two columns of figures show the influence of POR*28. The last two columns of figures show the influence of the intron variant g.6593 A>G.

Neither *POR*28* polymorphisms nor the 6593A>G intron variant had any influence on bupropion enantiomers’ apparent oral clearance or renal clearance, or on bupropion t-butyl hydroxylation, based on enantiomers plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios or urine formation clearances, or on bupropion reduction based on urine erythro- and threohydrobupropion formation clearances. Subjects with the GG genotype of the 6593A>G intron variant had somewhat less bupropion t-butyl and 4-hydroxylation, based on urine metabolite formation clearances, which was statistically significant for only 4-hydroxbupropion in GG homozygotes.

## Discussion

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of *CYP2B6*, *CYP2C19*, and *POR* single nucleotide variants on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of oral bupropion and metabolites, with specific attention to comprehensive metabolite coverage and enantiomeric analysis. The major result was that *CYP2B6*6* carriers and *CYP2B6* 516G>T carriers, compared with reference non-carriers, had lower bupropion hydroxylation, and consequently greater plasma *R*- and *S*-bupropion concentrations and lower *R,R-* and *S,S*-hydroxybupropion concentrations. Other major results were that neither *CYP2C19* nor *POR* variants had a significant effect on bupropion hydroxylation and plasma bupropion and hydroxybupropion stereoisomer concentrations. *CYP2C19* variants did influence other metabolic pathways, including bupropion keto reduction and 4’-hydroxylation. Due to the highly polymorphic nature of *CYP2B6* and *CYP2C19* and the large number of variants, some genotype groups were small and this influenced the statistical significance of some numerical differences.

The first major finding revealed the influence of *CYP2B6* allelic variants on the stereoselective disposition of steady-state bupropion and metabolites enantiomers. Compared with reference non-carriers, *CYP2B6*6* carriers had lesser bupropion enantiomers hydroxylation, evidenced by approximately 30% lower plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios and 25–50% lower hydroxybupropion formation clearances, resulting in greater *R*- and *S*-bupropion plasma concentrations and lower *R,R-* and *S,S*-hydroxybupropion plasma concentrations. Apparent R-bupropion oral clearance was significantly lower in *CYP2B6*6* homozygotes.

Observed *CYP2B6*6* variant effects on steady-state bupropion stereoisomers disposition are consistent with prior in vitro and in vivo human studies. In vitro, human cDNA-expressed CYP2B6.6 was less active (one-third to one-half of CYP2B6.1 activity) in hydroxylation of racemic bupropion ([Zhang et al., 2011](#B49); [Xu et al., 2012](#B47); [Radloff et al., 2013](#B40)) and both bupropion enantiomers ([Wang et al., 2020](#B44)), and activity in human liver microsomes from *CYP2B6*6* carriers was also less than in microsomes from non-carriers ([Hesse et al., 2004](#B18)). In vivo, evaluation of a single bupropion dose, without regard to stereochemistry (achirally), found that hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios were lower in *CYP2B6*6* carriers versus non-carriers ([Chung et al., 2011](#B6); [Gao et al., 2016](#B15); [Lv et al., 2016](#B32); [Ma et al., 2018](#B33)). Evaluation of steady-state bupropion disposition, also assessed achirally, found lower plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios in intermediate and poor CYP2B6 metabolizers ([Zhu et al., 2012](#B50)), carriers of *CYP2B6*6* (and other reduced function) alleles ([Benowitz et al., 2013](#B3)) and lower plasma hydroxybupropion AUCs in *CYP2B6*6* carriers ([Høiseth et al., 2015](#B21)), all compared with *CYP2B6*1/*1* reference. In vivo, chiral analysis, after single-dose bupropion, found hydroxylation of both enantiomers, assessed by plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios and urine hydroxybupropion formation clearances, was lower in *CYP2B6*6/*6* but not *CYP2B6*1/*6* compared with *CYP2B6*1/*1* genotypes, but not stereoselectively (*R,R*- versus *S,S*-hydroxybupropion and bupropion enantiomers concentrations were not different) ([Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23)). Similarly, plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios and hydroxybupropion AUCs were lower in *CYP2B6* poor metabolizers, although bupropion concentrations were unchanged ([Gufford et al., 2022](#B16)). Overall, the magnitude of *CYP2B6*6* effects on bupropion hydroxylation appear comparable after a single dose and at steady-state.

The second major finding was the influence of the *CYP2B6* 516G>T single nucleotide variant on the stereoselective disposition of bupropion and metabolites. This influence was broader and stronger than that of just *CYP2B6*6*. The 516G>T variant is one of two comprising *CYP2B6*6* (the other is 785A>G), and is also found in other *CYP2B6* alleles (**7, *9, *13, *19, *20, *26, *29, *34, *36, *37, *38, *39, *40, *41, *42, *43)* and is considered a canonical decreased function variant. Therefore, we assessed the influence of the 516G>T single nucleotide variant alone. 516T carriers, compared with non-carriers, had less bupropion hydroxylation (one-third lower hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUCs, and 50% less hydroxybupropion formation clearances) as well as lower plasma hydroxybupropion concentrations and bupropion apparent oral clearances. These effects on steady-state bupropion disposition are consistent with prior in vitro human studies. Expressed CYPs 2B6.6, 2B6.9, 2B6.16, 2B6.19, and 2B6.26 all had lower bupropion hydroxylase activity in vitro compared with CYP2B6.1 ([Wang et al., 2020](#B44)). 516T effects on bupropion apparent oral clearance as well as hydroxylation, and statistical significance, compared with *CYP2B6*6*, may simply reflect the sizes of the various genotype cohorts. However profound inhibition of bupropion hydroxylation caused by drug interactions decreased both plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios and bupropion oral clearance ([Turpeinen et al., 2005](#B43)).

An unexpected observation was that in addition to lower hydroxybupropion formation clearances, 516T carriers also had lower formation clearances of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion isomers, 4-hydroxy-bupropion, and 4-hydroxy-erythro/threo-hydrobupropion. An explanation for this result is not apparent from the data. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model suggested that for single-dose bupropion, predicted metabolism was 58% by CYP2B6, 28% via carbonyl reduction, and 13% via CYP2C19 ([Marok et al., 2021](#B34)). Chemical inhibition of CYP2B6 decreased bupropion clearance much less than that of hydroxylation ([Turpeinen et al., 2005](#B43)), which was attributed to a metabolic shift from hydroxylation to keto reduction (forming erythro- and threo-hydrobupropion) ([Palovaara et al., 2003](#B38)). We did not observe such a shift in *CYP2B6* 516T carriers.

The third major finding in this investigation was the influence of *CYP2C19* variants on steady-state bupropion isomers disposition. CYP2C19 catalyzes minor metabolic pathways, including in vitro 4’-hydroxylation of bupropion to a primary metabolite (4’-hydroxybupropion) and secondary metabolism of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion to 4’-hydroxy-erythrohydrobupropion and 4’-hydroxy-threohydrobupropion ([Chen et al., 2010](#B5); [Sager et al., 2016b](#B42)), and may be a minor contributor to bupropion t-butyl hydroxylation in vitro ([Sager et al., 2016b](#B42)). The role of CYP2C19 in human in vivo bupropion disposition is not well understood. We found that *CYP2C19* metabolizer phenotype had no influence on bupropion apparent oral clearance nor on t-butyl hydroxylation (as expected). Prior studies also found that *CYP2C19* polymorphisms did not influence human in vivo t-butyl hydroxylation of single-dose bupropion enantiomers ([Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23)) or steady-state racemate ([Zhu et al., 2014](#B51)), although the reduced function *CYP2C19*2* allele was associated with higher steady-state plasma racemic bupropion, erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion AUCs ([Zhu et al., 2014](#B51)). We also found that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers had lower formation clearance of 4’-hydroxy-erythro/threo-hydrobupropion (our assay did not distinguish between 4’-hydroxy-erythrohydrobupropion and 4’-hydroxy-threohydrobupropion). Lesser parent and metabolite 4’-hydroxylation is consistent with the prior in vitro studies ([Chen et al., 2010](#B5); [Sager et al., 2016b](#B42)). 4’-hydroxylation of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion represents a branch point in secondary metabolism (versus glucuronidation), and it is possible that lower CYP2C19 activity causes a metabolic shift from 4’-hydroxylation to glucuronidation, and may participate in human steady-state bupropion metabolism *via* these minor pathways.

The fourth major finding was that *POR* variants had no significant effect on steady-state bupropion disposition, including plasma bupropion and hydroxybupropion stereoisomer concentrations, apparent oral clearance, and metabolite formation clearances. We evaluated the *POR*28* (c.1508C>T) allele (no subjects carried the *POR*5* or *POR*8* alleles), the intron variant g.6593 A>G, and the rs2868177 GC-rs1057868 GT diplotype (which was carried in only three subjects and was not analyzed) ([Wang et al., 2022](#B45)). Neither *POR*28* nor the intron variant g.6593 A>G affected bupropion disposition. Lack of *POR* polymorphisms effects is consistent with prior studies showing no difference in in vitro bupropion hydroxylation with POR.28 compared with POR.1 ([Wang et al., 2020](#B44)) and lack of influence of *POR*28* on in vivo on hydroxylation or disposition of single-dose bupropion enantiomers ([Gao et al., 2016](#B15); [Lv et al., 2016](#B32); [Kharasch and Crafford, 2019](#B23)). In contrast with the present findings, two studies paradoxically reported greater hydroxybupropion/bupropion plasma AUC ratios in 6593G carriers ([Gao et al., 2016](#B15); [Lv et al., 2016](#B32)).

There are limitations to the present investigation. The cohort was a convenience sample with respect to genotypes and phenotypes. Although *CYP2B6* diplotype frequencies resembled reported population frequencies, *CYP2C19* phenotypes were somewhat over- and under-representative of rapid and normal metabolizers, respectively. In addition, a relatively small number of subjects was studied, and some genotype cohorts were very small. This may have contributed to apparent numerically larger or smaller, but not statistically significant, differences, for example in *CYP2B6*6* and bupropion hydroxylation and apparent oral clearance and *CYP2C19* and poor/intermediate metabolizers and metabolite formation clearances. Larger cohort sizes would be needed to further assess these differences.

Genetic variation causing altered bupropion metabolism (hydroxylation) and bioactivation has clinical importance ([El-Boraie and Tyndale, 2021](#B12)). The clinical importance of metabolite formation has been recognized for smoking cessation and antidepressant therapy ([Lee et al., 2007](#B30); [Zhu et al., 2012](#B50); [Laib et al., 2014](#B29)). Specifically, smokers with *CYP2B6* variants causing diminished catalytic activity and hydroxybupropion formation had higher smoking cessation relapse rates ([Lerman et al., 2002](#B31); [Lee et al., 2007](#B30)). Lower plasma hydroxybupropion concentrations were associated with worse smoking–cessation outcomes ([Zhu et al., 2012](#B50)). While *CYP2C19* genetic variants were associated with altered bupropion racemate pharmacokinetics, they were not associated with smoking cessation outcomes ([Zhu et al., 2014](#B51)). The present results demonstrate that *CYP2B6*6* carriers, and more broadly *CYP2B6* 516T carriers, have decreased steady state metabolism of bupropion, hydroxybupropion formation, and hydroxybupropion plasma concentrations. Testing for the canonical *CYP2B6* 516G>T variant alone may be informative and clinically useful for therapeutic benefit and potentially for side effects, risks, and their mitigation ([Barlati et al., 2023](#B2); [Wang et al., 2023](#B46)).
