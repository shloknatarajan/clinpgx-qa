## Abstract

**Aims:** 
Despite longstanding recognition of significant age‐dependent differences in drug disposition during childhood, the exact course and the underlying mechanisms are not known. Our aim was to determine the course and determinants of individual relative dose requirements, during long‐term follow‐up in children on tacrolimus.

**Methods:** 
This was a cohort study in a tertiary hospital with standardized annual pharmacokinetic (PK) follow‐up (AUC0–12hr) in recipients of a renal allograft (≤19 years), between 1998 and 2015. In addition, the presence of relevant pharmacogenetic variants was determined. The evolution of dose‐corrected exposure was evaluated using mixed models.

**Results:** 
A total of 184 PK visits by 43 children were included in the study (median age: 14.6). AUC0–12h corrected for dose per kg demonstrated a biphasic course: annual increase 4.4% (CI: 0.3–8.7%) until ±14 years of age, followed by 13.4% increase (CI 8.7–18.3%). Moreover, exposure corrected for dose per m2 proved stable until 14 years (+0.8% annually; CI: −3.0 to +4.8%), followed by a steep increase ≥14 years (+11%; CI: 7.0–16.0%). Analysis according to bone maturation instead of age demonstrated a similar course with a distinct divergence at TW2: 800 (P = 0.01). Genetic variation in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 was associated with altered dose requirements, independent of age.

**Conclusions:** 
Children exhibit a biphasic course in tacrolimus disposition characterized by a high and stable drug clearance until a specific phase in pubertal development (TW2: 800 at age: ±14 years), followed by an important decline in relative dose requirements thereafter. Pharmacogenetic variation demonstrated an age/puberty independent effect. We suggest a critical reappraisal of current paediatric dosing algorithms for tacrolimus and drugs with a similar disposition.

### Aims

Despite longstanding recognition of significant age‐dependent differences in drug disposition during childhood, the exact course and the underlying mechanisms are not known. Our aim was to determine the course and determinants of individual relative dose requirements, during long‐term follow‐up in children on tacrolimus.

### Methods

This was a cohort study in a tertiary hospital with standardized annual pharmacokinetic (PK) follow‐up (AUC_0–12hr_) in recipients of a renal allograft (≤19 years), between 1998 and 2015. In addition, the presence of relevant pharmacogenetic variants was determined. The evolution of dose‐corrected exposure was evaluated using mixed models.

### Results

A total of 184 PK visits by 43 children were included in the study (median age: 14.6). AUC_0–12h_ corrected for dose per kg demonstrated a biphasic course: annual increase 4.4% (CI: 0.3–8.7%) until ±14 years of age, followed by 13.4% increase (CI 8.7–18.3%). Moreover, exposure corrected for dose per m^2^ proved stable until 14 years (+0.8% annually; CI: −3.0 to +4.8%), followed by a steep increase ≥14 years (+11%; CI: 7.0–16.0%). Analysis according to bone maturation instead of age demonstrated a similar course with a distinct divergence at TW2: 800 (*P* = 0.01). Genetic variation in *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, and *CYP3A7* was associated with altered dose requirements, independent of age.

### Conclusions

Children exhibit a biphasic course in tacrolimus disposition characterized by a high and stable drug clearance until a specific phase in pubertal development (TW2: 800 at age: ±14 years), followed by an important decline in relative dose requirements thereafter. Pharmacogenetic variation demonstrated an age/puberty independent effect. We suggest a critical reappraisal of current paediatric dosing algorithms for tacrolimus and drugs with a similar disposition.

## Introduction

According to recent registry data, 60–70% of paediatric renal transplant recipients are treated with tacrolimus at the time of discharge after transplantation [4](#bcp13174-bib-0004), [5](#bcp13174-bib-0005). Consequently, the vast majority of these children are exposed to this drug during the remainder of their childhood years towards adulthood. Notwithstanding its success as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation, tacrolimus is not a very safe drug to use due to a narrow therapeutic index with potential important consequences of under‐ or overexposure (i.e. rejection, infection, malignancy and nephrotoxicity). Furthermore, studies in adult allograft recipients have shown that it is difficult to achieve the desired level of exposure due to important inter‐ and intraindividual variation in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, demanding frequent drug monitoring and dose adjustments [6](#bcp13174-bib-0006).

Tacrolimus disposition occurs through the concerted action of the human body's main enzymes and transporters for the handling of xenobiotics (CYP3A and P glycoprotein) [7](#bcp13174-bib-0007). Common variation of genes involved in the expression of these players can partially explain variation in individual dose requirements. In particular, carriers of a polymorphism in *CYP3A5*, designated *CYP3A5*1*, demonstrate two‐ to threefold higher tacrolimus dose requirements [8](#bcp13174-bib-0008). The frequency of the *CYP3A5*1* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is highly dependent on ethnicity and is present in a minority of Caucasians (5–15%), Asians (15–35%) and Mexicans (25%). But this allele is present in the majority of people from African descent (45–73%) [9](#bcp13174-bib-0009). In children, age‐related variation in intestinal transit time, body composition, protein binding, organ function and expression of aforementioned enzymes and transporters can play an additional role [10](#bcp13174-bib-0010), [11](#bcp13174-bib-0011), [12](#bcp13174-bib-0012).

Multiple studies in a paediatric population have demonstrated an up to 2.7‐fold higher relative dose per kg bodyweight to achieve the same target blood concentrations in young children *vs.* adolescents after renal transplantation [13](#bcp13174-bib-0013), [14](#bcp13174-bib-0014), [15](#bcp13174-bib-0015), [16](#bcp13174-bib-0016). However, these studies provided only partial recognition of the course of individual dose requirements from infancy to adulthood because the majority were performed shortly after transplantation when phenomena known to affect drug disposition such as organ dysfunction, inflammation, extensive concomitant medication, altered food intake, and changes in body composition, are common. In addition, most were based on small patient numbers, measurements of trough levels only, and had a cross‐sectional design with limited follow‐up. Therefore the underlying individual determinants of the required dose to attain a desired level of tacrolimus exposure during childhood remain unknown.

Despite the recognition of the aforementioned ‘age‐dependent’ tacrolimus dose requirements in children, current practice in many paediatric transplant centres still entails a fixed starting dose (based on body weight) followed by frequent dose alterations in function of the desired trough level (dependent on the time after transplantation and the clinical context). A better understanding of tacrolimus disposition in the course of childhood could help in the development of better dosing algorithms in children and reduce episodes of drug under‐ or overexposure.

The primary aim of our study was to describe subject‐specific, dose‐corrected tacrolimus exposure in a cohort of renal allograft recipients over the course of time during childhood. In addition, we aimed to identify clinical and nonclinical (genetic) determinants of paediatric tacrolimus dose‐corrected exposure during long‐term follow‐up.

## Methods

This is a single‐centre study (University Hospitals Leuven) with data obtained between 1998 and 2015 from stable isolated renal allograft recipients ≤19 years of age. The initial tacrolimus dose (innovator formulation, Astellas, Tokyo, Japan) at transplantation is based upon bodyweight (BW): 0.3 mg kg^−1^ day^−1^ b.i.d., and then adjusted according to our clinical protocol based upon target trough levels: 10–15 ng ml^−1^ in month 1; 8–12 ng ml^−1^ until month 6 after transplantation; and 5–7 ng ml^−1^ thereafter, in combination with the clinical status of the patient. Dose‐interval tacrolimus PK assessments were performed in subjects at steady state (last dose adjustment ≥1 week before visit) during the second day of a routine annual hospitalization for clinical follow‐up investigations. When reported drug compliance was suboptimal in the week prior to admission, no profile is performed. Additional maintenance immunosuppression included prednisolone, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Patient characteristics and laboratory data were retrieved from the files. Body surface area was calculated with the Mosteller formula [17](#bcp13174-bib-0017). The stage of skeletal maturity at the PK visit was scored according to the Tanner and Whitehouse 2 method (TW2) on a plain radiograph of the left hand [18](#bcp13174-bib-0018). Tacrolimus exposure was represented by the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) with samples collected at 0 (trough), 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h after oral administration and calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Whole‐blood tacrolimus concentrations were determined with an antibody conjugated magnetic immunoassay (Dimension^®^ RxL analyser, Dade Behring, Deerfield, Illinois) until December 2010 and thereafter with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Architect i2000^®^, Abbott Diagnostics, Lake Forest, Illinois). Passing−Bablok regression and Bland–Altman plot demonstrated a good correlation between both methods (*R* ^2^ = 0.98) with −5.3% lower reported values (Architect^®^ versus Dimension^®^) at a mean concentration of 10 μg l^−1^ and a mean difference of −5.9% (95% CI: −11.8–0.1%) over a range of test samples from 2.5 to 25 μg l^−1^. Data obtained from visits with a concurrent episode of gastroenteritis or medication known to affect tacrolimus disposition (e.g. macrolide antibiotics) were excluded from analysis.

Children or parents were requested permission for mutation analysis of genes associated with tacrolimus metabolism. Genotyping for *CYP3A4*1B (rs2740574)*, *CYP3A5 (rs776746)*, *CYP3A7*1C*, *POR*28T (rs1057868)* and *ABCB1 3435C>T (rs1045642)*, *1236C>T (rs1128503)* and *2677G>T/A (rs2032582)* was performed by amplification of relevant segments with polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing via the ABI PRISM^®^ 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, Massachusetts). Primers are described in supplemental Table [S1](#bcp13174-supitem-0001)

### Statistics

Mann–Whitney U, one‐sample, paired‐sample or independent *t*‐test and one‐way anova were used to compare clinical characteristics and outcome parameters. Associations between outcome variables were tested using Spearman correlations. In children, age and bodyweight or BSA are highly correlated. To correct for the potential confounding effect of BW and BSA in the analysis of the effect of age on drug exposure, we normalized dose according to these anthropometric parameters (i.e. AUC_0–12h_ divided by dose in mg kg^–1^ or dose in mg m^−2^). The course of the resulting dose‐corrected exposure in function of time or age was evaluated using linear mixed models for repeated measures. Since the distribution was right‐skewed, the analysis was performed on log‐transformed (ln) data. First, an additive model was used with age and time since transplantation as main effects, assuming linearity. Second, to check for nonlinearity, the same model was fitted allowing nonlinearity using restricted cubic splines (with four knots) for age [19](#bcp13174-bib-0019). Third, to illustrate the type of nonlinearity, a segmented regression model was fitted assuming two linear phases, with the cutoff point at 14 years (based on visual inspection of individual profiles). In all these mixed models, a random intercept and random (linear) slope were used to model the (co)variance of the longitudinal measurements. Alternatively in all models, TW2 score was used as a continuous and sex‐independent variable instead of age, with a cutoff point at 800. The additional effect of genetic variation on relative exposure was tested in the linear mixed model with two phases. It was verified if the variant had a main effect on exposure and/or altered the slope (by adding the interaction between the variant and each of the linear slopes). Only variants associated with at least five individual patients in both phases were selected; each variant was analysed separately. There are two patients with two post‐transplant periods. In all analyses, these are considered as independent observations. *P*‐values < 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using SAS for Windows, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

#### Ethics

The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethical board (B322201317188) and was registered at [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) (identifier: [NCT01767350](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01767350)). Written consent was given by all subjects/parents.

## Results

Clinical and genetic characteristics of the cohort are described in Table [1](#bcp13174-tbl-0001). We included a total of 43 children (45 renal transplant procedures), which constituted all recipients of a solitary renal transplant on tacrolimus in follow‐up at our centre during the inclusion period. DNA was not available for three subjects. We were able to calculate tacrolimus AUC_0–12h_ in 184 of 226 PK visits (an insufficient number of samples was drawn for the remainder). Two visits were excluded because of concurrent gastroenteritis. Noncompliance surrounding the available ‘full’ PK visits was not reported nor suspected. The clinical characteristics of the PK visits are shown in Table [2](#bcp13174-tbl-0002). There was a wide range in tacrolimus dose from 0.02 to 0.98 mg kg^−1^ day^−1^ (b.i.d.). The cross‐sectional PK characteristics of these visits are shown in supplemental Table [S2](#bcp13174-supitem-0002).

In accordance with our clinical protocol specifying a staged decrease in target trough levels throughout the first year after transplantation, absolute tacrolimus exposure (AUC_0–12h_) decreases with time after transplantation and remains relatively stable after that first year (mean: 141.7 ± 53.4 ng h ml^−1^ in the first year *vs.* 105.4 ± 31.0 during further follow‐up). However, there is no intended nor observed relation between absolute AUC_0–12h_ and age (Figure [1](#bcp13174-fig-0001)).

### Figure 1.

![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/94aa/5346878/b4d1a4b318e3/BCP-83-863-g001.jpg)

Subject‐specific profiles of absolute tacrolimus exposure (AUC0–12h in ng h ml−1) for ‘time after transplantation’ (A), and ‘age’ (B) in years. Each dot represents a visit with an AUC0–12h assessment. Consecutive visits from the same individual are connected with lines

In contrast, tacrolimus AUC_0‐12h_ corrected for dose per kg (AUC_0–12h_/_doseBW_ (in ng h ml^−1^ /mg kg^−1^) demonstrates an increase with both ‘time after transplantation’ and ‘age’. However, in the models with both parameters as main effects, only ‘age’ is a significant determinant of AUC_0‐12h_/_doseBW_ with an 8.5% increase per year (CI: 4.8–12.3%; *P* < 0.001) resulting in a 3.4‐fold increase in dose‐corrected exposure over 15 years during childhood (upper panels in Figure [2](#bcp13174-fig-0002)). Time after transplantation was not a significant determinant (+1.6% per year; CI −1.9–5.1%; *P* = 0.37). Other potential determinants of tacrolimus disposition (in particular corticosteroid dose (mg m^−2^ day^−1^), serum albumin level, haematocrit and the use of calcium channel blockers or human growth hormone) did not have a significant additional effect next to age on long‐term dose‐corrected exposure in the multivariate models. The subject‐specific longitudinal profile based on AUC_0–12h_/_doseBW_ demonstrates an increase in the slope occurring between years 12 and 16. The mixed model with splines confirmed this (F_2,103_: 4.18; *P* = 0.02). A segmented regression model with a predefined cutoff point at 14 years describes an annual increment of 4.4% (CI: 0.3–8.7%) under 14 years of age, increasing towards 13.4% (CI 8.7%–18.3%; *P* < 0.001); in older children (AUC_0–12h_/_doseBW_ < 14 years: 729.5 * 1.044^^age^; ≥14 years: 1333.0 * 1.134^^age‐14^).

The relation of age (years) with tacrolimus exposure corrected for dose per kg bodyweight (AUC0−12h/doseBW (ng h ml−1/mg kg−1)) depicted in the upper panels (A, B, C) versus exposure corrected for dose per m2 body surface area (AUC0−12h/doseBSA (ng h ml−1/mg m−2)) in the lower panels (D, E, F). Panel A and D represent subject‐specific profiles of relative tacrolimus exposure corrected for dose. Each dot represents a visit with an AUC0−12h assessment. Consecutive visits from the same individual are connected with lines. Panel B and E represent a plot based upon the mixed model for the relation of relative tacrolimus exposure corrected for dose with age, allowing non‐linearity in the relation. The dashed straight green line refers to the model assuming linearity. Panel C and F represent a plot based upon the segmented regression model with two linear phases for the predicted relation of relative tacrolimus exposure corrected for dose with age, and a cut off point at 14 years (dashed lines referring to the pointwise 95 percent confidence interval)

Similarly, tacrolimus AUC_0–12h_ corrected for dose per m^2^ (AUC_0‐12hr_/_doseBSA_ (in ng h ml^−1^ /mg m^−2^) demonstrates a 5.4% increase per year of age (CI: 1.9–9.0%; *P* = 0.002), in accordance with a 2.2‐fold increase over 15 years during childhood. Again, analysis of the longitudinal profiles demonstrates nonlinearity (F_2,103_: 6.35; *P* < 0.001), but with relatively stable dose‐corrected exposure in early childhood: 0.8% per year (CI: −3.0%–+4.8%) followed by a significant increase after 14 years: +11.0% (CI: 7.0–16.0%; AUC_0–12h_/_doseBSA_ < 14 years: 36.4 * 1.008^^age^; ≥14 years: 40.9 * 1.110^^age‐14^; lower panels in Figure [2](#bcp13174-fig-0002)).

Subjects homozygous for *CYP3A5*3* or *CYP3A4*1* demonstrate 1.9 and 2.1 times, respectively, higher dose‐corrected exposure than their genetic counterparts (illustrated in Figure [3](#bcp13174-fig-0003) and Table [3](#bcp13174-tbl-0003)). Four out of six *CYP3A4*1B allele* carriers were additional *CYP3A5*1* carriers. Subjects homozygous for *CYP3A7*1* have ±60% lower relative exposure than **1C* carriers (even after exclusion of *CYP3A5*1*: ratio 0.72, *P* = 0.03). The ratio of relative exposure according to *CYP3A4*1B*, *CYP3A5* and *CYP3A7* genotype does not vary significantly before and after 14 years. *POR*28T* did not have an effect, probably because we had insufficient observations to study its effect in *CYP3A5*1* carriers [20](#bcp13174-bib-0020). Although dose‐corrected exposure appeared lower in homozygous *TT* carriers of the *ABCB1 SNPs*, this was not consistently significant for both BSA‐ and BW‐corrected parameters. The addition of genotype to the segmented linear model with two phases for age resulted in a more adequate capture of the relation between age and dose‐corrected exposure. In particular, the incorporation of *CYP3A5* genotype resulted in an increase in *R* ^2^ statistics from 0.34 to 0.53 for AUC_0–12h_/_doseBW_ and 0.23 to 0.49 for AUC_0–12h_/_doseBSA_ (Table [4](#bcp13174-tbl-0004))_._ Nonetheless, a large amount of unexplained variation still remains.

We used the segmented linear models for age in combination with the effect of the *CYP3A5* genotype to illustrate the difference between predicted and observed individual AUC_0‐12h_ (based on the actual dose at the different PK visits). In general, predicted individual AUC_0‐12h_ was in close agreement with the observed AUC_0–12h,_ but with a wide 95% confidence interval (‘*predicted AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose per kg*’ minus ‘*observed AUC* _0–12h_’: −1.6 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −92.5–89.3) and for ‘*predicted AUC* _0–12hr_ *based on dose* *per m* ^2^’: −1.8 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −87.0–83.5)).

We tested a simplified equation to predict individual AUC_0–12h_ with a fixed value for dose‐corrected exposure set at the median age of both age groups (i.e. 7 years for age < 14 years and 17 years for age between 14 and 20 years) and for both methods of dose‐normalization. That is, ‘*AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose for BW*’ <14 years = 586 * dose (in mg kg^−1^ per administration) for *CYP3A5*1 allele* carriers *vs.* 1114 * dose for non‐carriers; ‘*AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose for BW*’ ≥ 14 years = 1156 * dose in carriers *vs.* 2197 * dose in non‐carriers. ‘*AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose for BSA*’ <14 years = 22.3 * dose (in mg m^−2^ per administration) in *CYP3A5*1 allele* carriers *vs.* 43.5 * dose in non‐carriers and ‘*AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose for BSA*’ ≥ 14 years = 33.2 * dose in carriers *vs.* 63.2 in non‐carriers.

Again, ‘*observed AUC* _0–12h_’ was not significantly different from the predicted AUC_0–12h_ based upon a fixed relative exposure for both age groups, but lacked precision (‘*predicted AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose per kg*’ minus *‘observed AUC* _0–12h_ ^’^: −5.7 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −117.4–106.0); for ‘*predicted AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose* *per m* ^2^’: −0.1 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −102.2–102.0). However, while in children <14 years ‘*predicted AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose* *per m* ^2^’ was in accordance with ‘*observed AUC* _0–12h_’ (mean difference: −1.1 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −79.3–77.1), those based upon dose per kg were not (mean difference: −14.3 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −91.1–62.5); *P* = 0.001). For subjects ≥14 years, both equations performed similarly (‘*predicted AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose per kg*’ minus ‘*observed AUC* _0‐12h_’: 1.4 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −131.7–134.5) and for ‘*predicted AUC* _0–12h_ *based on dose* *per m* ^2^’: 0.7 ng h ml^−1^ (95% CI: −117.9–119.3).

Based upon the observed change at 14 years, we explored the role of pubertal development and analysed dose‐corrected exposure according to skeletal maturation (i.e. TW2 score) as a surrogate parameter for pubertal development instead of age (Figure [4](#bcp13174-fig-0004)). Linear regression demonstrated an approcimately 50‐point increase in TW2 score per year bone age. Analysis of the longitudinal profiles confirmed nonlinearity (AUC_0‐12h_/_doseBW_: F_2,103_: 4.68, *P* = 0.01 and AUC_0–12h_/_doseBSA_: F_2,103_: 4.10, *P* = 0.02) with a decrease of −0.5% in AUC_0–12h_/_doseBW_ (CI: −0.7–0.0%) or −1.98% for AUC_0‐12h_/_doseBSA_ (CI: −2.0% to −1.9%) per 50 TW2 points in children with TW2 < 800 *vs.* a pronounced increase for subjects with a higher TW2 score: +8.3% (CI: 8.2–8.4%; *P* < 0.01) and +6.7% per 50 TW2 points (CI: 6.6–6.8%; *P* = 0.01), respectively. Although, this analysis confirmed the biphasic course also observed in the analysis according to age, the fit of the model (including *CYP3A5* genotype) was less good (*R* ^2^: 0.44 *vs.* 0.53 for AUC_0–12h_/_doseBW_ and 0.42–0.49 for AUC_0–12h_/_doseBSA_ (Table [4](#bcp13174-tbl-0004))).

## Discussion

Our study illustrates the importance of ontogeny in paediatric drug metabolism towards adulthood and demonstrates for the first time that children exhibit a distinct biphasic course in dose‐corrected drug exposure during long‐term follow‐up characterized by a relatively high and stable tacrolimus clearance before ±14 years followed by a sharp decline thereafter. This is especially evident when exposure is normalized for dose according to body surface area. Additional analyses suggest a pivotal role for the underlying physiological mechanisms associated with bone maturation (and puberty) in the change in tacrolimus metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effects of genetic variants in *CYP3A4*1B*, *CYP3A5*, and *CYP3A7* on dose‐corrected exposure is not affected by age.

Our results are in line with previous studies, which demonstrated higher relative tacrolimus dose requirements to obtain target trough levels in young *vs.* older children after renal transplantation [13](#bcp13174-bib-0013), [14](#bcp13174-bib-0014), [16](#bcp13174-bib-0016). This appears to contrast with the findings in two studies that applied nonlinear mixed‐effects modelling and failed to identify age as a determinant of tacrolimus clearance in comparison with bodyweight [21](#bcp13174-bib-0021), [22](#bcp13174-bib-0022). However, in addition to the lack of more elaborate individual follow‐up data in these studied cohorts, the PK analysis was based on an allometry model with fixed coefficients (exponent of 0.75 for clearance), which does not take age and substrate‐related differences in drug disposition into account [10](#bcp13174-bib-0010), [23](#bcp13174-bib-0023). Nonetheless, our study demonstrates that these findings are not necessarily contradictory with previous observations. With the help of a segmented regression model applied on our dataset, incorporating sequential PK data obtained from different individuals, we were able to demonstrate that relative tacrolimus exposure indeed does not increase continuously with age, but can be divided in two distinct stages.

Although our study describes a relatively small number of patients in comparison with studies in the adult population, it contains a large set of extensive pharmacokinetic data obtained during long‐term follow‐up of these individual patients, especially for the field of paediatrics. Nonetheless, the study size limits the possibility to look for additional determinants of tacrolimus exposure. The absence of an additional effect of previously described determinants of tacrolimus disposition (corticosteroid dose, serum albumin level, haematocrit) can also be attributed to the low dose of corticosteroids and the relatively homogeneous values of these variables during long‐term follow‐up. The 5–6% lower reported tacrolimus concentrations as a result of a change in the analytical methodology is a potential source of systematic bias. However, this is relatively small in relation to the observed effect of age and the nature of this bias was the same for all collected PK data for both those collected before and after December 2010, irrespective of age. An additional analysis confirmed that this did not affect the main findings from our study*.* Our data are skewed towards the adolescent age group and therefore we cannot deduce information on tacrolimus disposition in pre‐school children or further into adulthood. Nonetheless, the mean dose‐corrected exposure at 20 years according to our segmented linear model is in close accordance with reported relative exposure in an adult population of renal transplant recipients (AUC_0–12h_/_doseBSA_in our study: 76.5 *vs.* 77.7 ng h ml^−1^/mg m^−2^ in a adult cohort with a range of 20–75 years of age) [24](#bcp13174-bib-0024), suggesting a levelling of relative exposure after adolescence. Furthermore, validation of a simplified equation derived from our segmented linear model incorporating the effects of age and *CYP3A5* genotype confirmed a good correlation with observed tacrolimus exposure (in particular when based on BSA). However, this predictive model lacked precision, illustrating the presence of additional determinants responsible for the large variation in intra‐ and interindividual tacrolimus clearance, and limiting its clinical applicability. In addition, our dataset contains children during long‐time follow‐up after transplantation and therefore does not reflect, nor is it fit to predict, the relation between starting dose and exposure. Nonetheless, our model suggests that a commonly desired target in the first months after transplantation (AUC_0–12h_ of circa 200 ng h ml^−1^) would require a mean dose of 0.68 mg kg^−1^ day^−1^ for *CYP3A5 *1* allele carriers and 0.36 mg kg^−1^ day^−1^ for the non‐carriers under 14 years. For the children >14 years this would be 0.35 mg kg^−1^ day^−1^ and 0.18 mg kg^−1^ day^−1^, respectively. These values are largely in line with previous studies describing tacrolimus starting dose requirements in children and adults, although the predicted dose requirement for young *CYP3A5* expressers is relatively high [16](#bcp13174-bib-0016), [25](#bcp13174-bib-0025), [26](#bcp13174-bib-0026), [27](#bcp13174-bib-0027). Currently, there are no international guidelines for tacrolimus dosing in children and in practice the recommended starting dose for adults (0.2 mg kg^−1^ day^−1^) is often used. This is very close to our predicted starting dose for adolescent non‐*A5*1* allele carriers, but is probably too low for preadolescents. Although our analysis supports age‐ (and genotype‐)specific dosing guidelines in children, we would like to stress that our predicted dosing requirements should be approached with caution due to the large variation between individuals and aforementioned limitations. Our analysis certainly does not obviate the need for careful monitoring of exposure levels, especially in the first weeks after transplantation.

There are fundamental arguments in favour of correcting relative tacrolimus exposure for BSA over BW in children. Tacrolimus is a highly lipophilic drug with rapid uptake into cells lining the gut. Its low aqueous solubility will limit further drug distribution, preventing saturation of efflux transporters such as P‐gp and intracellular enzymes, such as *CYP3A*, which are highly expressed in gut and liver [28](#bcp13174-bib-0028). As a result of intensive degradation in these organs, tacrolimus is characterized by a high first‐pass metabolism and low oral bioavailability. Consequently, the functional capacity of these organs has a direct effect on tacrolimus disposition. In children, the increase of liver mass (LM) with age lags behind BW but is almost identical to that of BSA. The BW‐normalized clearance for drugs whose metabolism is dominated by enzymes such as *CYP3A*, demonstrates a negative correlation with age, which results in the perception of augmented clearance in young *vs.* older children. In contrast, the LM‐ or BSA‐normalized clearances of these drugs appear independent of age in pre‐adolescent children (in line with our observations) [29](#bcp13174-bib-0029), [30](#bcp13174-bib-0030). Therefore tacrolimus exposure corrected for doseBSA will better reflect the age‐related differences in the intrinsic capacity for drug metabolism of the liver and gut during childhood.

Our observations suggest the presence of a high and stable intrinsic metabolic capacity for tacrolimus until the onset of adolescence with a subsequent decrease thereafter. In accordance, Fakhoury *et al.* demonstrated relative higher duodenal *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* expression in children aged 1–6 years *vs.* older subjects (including adults) [31](#bcp13174-bib-0031). However, other studies could not demonstrate increased intrinsic functional *CYP3A4* expression in paediatric liver samples [32](#bcp13174-bib-0032), [33](#bcp13174-bib-0033) and also failed to demonstrate an age‐dependent effect on intestinal P‐gp expression in children >1 year [31](#bcp13174-bib-0031), [34](#bcp13174-bib-0034), [35](#bcp13174-bib-0035). To our knowledge, current data on the expression of these enzymes/transporters cannot unequivocally explain differences in drug metabolism during childhood. The specific localization of the cutoff point in the biphasic relationship for dose‐corrected exposure according to age or bone maturation suggests an important role for physiological changes involved in puberty, resulting in a decrease in tacrolimus clearance. In accordance, others have demonstrated a nonlinear increase in relative exposure of other *CYP3A* substrates, with an augmented exposure occurring in adolescents with a high sexual maturity score *vs.* those with a low score [36](#bcp13174-bib-0036), [37](#bcp13174-bib-0037). Changes in body composition occurring during puberty can influence drug disposition. However, important specific determinants for tacrolimus disposition, such as protein binding and *V* _d_ are not expected to play a major role in subjects that have reached steady‐state, such as in our cohort [10](#bcp13174-bib-0010). The temporal coincidence of hormonal fluctuations associated with puberty and changes in drug clearance suggests that alterations in drug metabolism might be regulated by growth hormone (GH) or androgens [38](#bcp13174-bib-0038). The onset of puberty is characterized by an increased release of gonadotropins and sex steroids followed by an augmented amplitude of pulsed GH production. The latter coincides with a peak in height velocity at the age of ±12 years for girls and ±14 years in boys. We could not detect a significant difference in the course according to age of dose‐corrected exposure between both sexes (data not shown). However, after renal transplantation children often exhibit an aberrant time course of sexual maturation, which is why we used TW2 score instead of age. The moment of peak height velocity corresponds with a concurrent acceleration in the progression of skeletal maturity associated with a TW2 score of circa 800 (independent of sex) [39](#bcp13174-bib-0039), [40](#bcp13174-bib-0040). After completion of puberty, GH levels fall towards prepubertal levels, whereas androgen levels decrease but remain higher than before. Indeed, animal and *in vitro* studies have demonstrated an effect of GH, oestrogen, testosterone and progesterone supplementation on expression of enzymes involved in hepatic drug metabolism [38](#bcp13174-bib-0038). Data on the effect of puberty on functional *CYP3A* expression in humans are lacking. In the children from our cohort that received GH treatment (because of stunting due to renal failure‐associated growth hormone resistance), we were unable to detect an effect on tacrolimus clearance in relation to GH treatment. However, subjects with ‘true’ GH deficiency are described to exhibit bidirectional alterations in clearance of *CYP3A* substrates under GH treatment dependent on the specific substrate and the length of treatment [41](#bcp13174-bib-0041), [42](#bcp13174-bib-0042), [43](#bcp13174-bib-0043), [44](#bcp13174-bib-0044). Interestingly, Das *et al.* demonstrated downregulation of hepatic cytochrome p450 expression in rodents in response to an octreotide‐induced pattern of augmented GH pulse amplitude, similar to that observed in adolescence [45](#bcp13174-bib-0045). In accordance, Dhir *et al.* showed that a pulsatile GH profile suppresses *in vitro* dexamethasone‐induced *CYP3A4*, *1A2* and *2D6* expression in human hepatocytes, whereas constant exposure resulted in increased expression [46](#bcp13174-bib-0046). These data suggest that (hepatic) *CYP3A* expression is suppressed under the influence of a specific hormonal profile occurring during puberty, a period coinciding with the moment of peak height velocity and bone maturation corresponding with a TW2 score of 800.

In line with previous studies, we confirmed circa two‐fold higher dose‐corrected tacrolimus exposure in children homozygous for *CYP3A5*3* versus *CYP3A5*1* carriers [21](#bcp13174-bib-0021), [22](#bcp13174-bib-0022), [27](#bcp13174-bib-0027). The relevance of the *CYP3A4*1B SNP* is not clear due to linkage with *CYP3A5*1*. *CYP3A7* constitutes one of the major CYP enzymes in foetal livers, but expression rapidly declines within the first years of life [47](#bcp13174-bib-0047). Carriers of the *CYP3A7*1C* allele maintain a higher level of expression into adulthood and have higher cyclosporine requirements [48](#bcp13174-bib-0048), [49](#bcp13174-bib-0049). Nonetheless, Elens *et al.* found no effect on tacrolimus requirements [50](#bcp13174-bib-0050) and in our cohort *CYP3A7*1C* carriers seem to have a lower tacrolimus clearance.

We found no relation between age and the effect of the polymorphisms on relative exposure during childhood, indicating a constant effect of genetic variation in these particular enzymes and transporters irrespective of age and superimposed on the underlying effect of puberty. However, possible differential expression of *CYP3A4* during puberty cannot be deduced from our dataset. The *CYP3A4*22 SNP (rs35599367)* is an interesting candidate for the exploration of potentially altered *CYP3A4* expression with age, since *T allele* carriers require 50% lower tacrolimus dose as a result of reduced *CYP3A4* activity [51](#bcp13174-bib-0051). In our cohort we found no *CYP3A4*22T* carriers. Therefore, it would be of interest to study the effect of relevant genetic variants in a larger longitudinal dataset (with more different individuals with a variable genetic background) or directly look at expression levels of relevant enzymes and transporters in sequential hepatic or intestinal tissue samples obtained before and after the onset of puberty.

In conclusion, our study sheds more light on the changes in tacrolimus disposition during childhood characterized by an important decrease in dose requirements (and drug clearance) starting at early adolescence and an age‐independent effect of specific pharmacogenetic variants. In current paediatric practice, tacrolimus dosing is initially based on bodyweight and thereafter adjusted with the help of drug monitoring and target levels largely determined by the clinical context. Considering the large variation in dose requirements between younger children and adolescents, appropriate dose recommendations are required in order to reach target exposure more quickly (to avoid toxicity and improve efficacy). However, it is difficult to translate the age‐dependent change in the relation between dose (for BW) and exposure into an ordinal model of dose recommendations per age category. Alternatively, our study demonstrates that the dose for BSA does not change significantly until the age of the pubertal growth spurt (or TW2 score of 800) and is therefore easier to apply. Analysis of genetic polymorphisms largely confirms their importance in determining longitudinal tacrolimus disposition in the paediatric age group, but requires additional exploration in other studies/populations. The latter remark does not pertain to the *CYP3A5 (rs776746)* SNP, since multiple studies in both adult and paediatric transplantation seem to support a circa two‐fold higher dose in the carriers of the *CYP3A5*1 allele*, independent of age or pubertal development. We propose a change in practice for tacrolimus dosing in children in that the starting dose should be based upon BSA and should take pubertal status into account (in our study represented by a threshold score for bone maturation). When available, additional pharmacogenetic information can help in guiding initial tacrolimus dosing. Moreover, the majority of currently prescribed drugs during childhood are metabolized via the same major pathways. Therefore these observations are also relevant for the dosing of other drugs with a similar metabolism in children.
