## Abstract

The influence of genetic polymorphism in inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) on thiopurine-induced adverse events has not been investigated in the context of combination chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study investigated the effects of a common ITPA variant allele (rs41320251) on mercaptopurine metabolism and toxicity during treatment of children with ALL. Significantly higher concentrations of methyl mercaptopurine nucleotides were found in patients with the nonfunctional ITPA allele. Moreover, there was a significantly higher probability of severe febrile neutropenia in patients with a variant ITPA allele among patients whose dose of mercaptopurine had been adjusted for TPMT genotype. In a cohort of patients whose mercaptopurine dose was not adjusted for TPMT phenotype, the TPMT genotype had a greater effect than the ITPA genotype. In conclusion, genetic polymorphism of ITPA is a significant determinant of mercaptopurine metabolism and of severe febrile neutropenia, after combination chemotherapy for ALL in which mercaptopurine doses are individualized on the basis of TPMT genotype.

## RESULTS

### Patients and TPMT/ITPA genotyping

For patients enrolled in the Total 13B protocol, *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes were determined in 244 of the 246 children included; in 2 patients *ITPA* genotype was not evaluable because the SNP call rate was <95% and failed replicate analysis by TaqMan assay. Among the 244 patients with both *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes, 11 (4.5%) were found to have one variant allele of the *TPMT* gene and one wild-type *ITPA* allele, 33 (13.5%) had one variant *ITPA* allele and one wild-type *TPMT* allele, and 1 patient (0.41%) had one variant allele for both *TPMT* and *ITPA*; all of the other 199 patients (81.6%) were wild type for both *TPMT* and *ITPA*. Because only 1 patient had a variant allele for both *TPMT* and *ITPA*, we performed parallel analyses in which data from this patient were excluded or included. The significant findings did not differ between these two analyses. Results presented in this article are those attained excluding this patient; those obtained when this patient was included are reported in the [Supplementary Data S1](#SD1) online.

For patients enrolled in the Total 12 protocol, *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes were determined in 101 of the 188 patients: the other patients were not studied, either because DNA was not collected or a sufficient quantity was no longer available. Among the 101 patients studied, 12 (11.9%) were found to have one variant allele of the *TPMT* gene and one wild-type *ITPA* allele, 19 (18.8%) had one variant *ITPA* allele and one wild-type *TPMT* allele, and no patient had one variant allele for both *TPMT* and *ITPA*; all of the other 70 patients (69.3%) were wild type for both *TPMT* and *ITPA*. The demographic characteristics of the patients enrolled are reported in [Table 1](#T1).

### Effect of TPMT/ITPA genotype on rate of de novo purine synthesis (Total 13B)

*De novo* purine synthesis was measured in ALL cells from 196 patients; 47 patients were not evaluable because of insufficient ALL cell yields from the bone marrow aspirate. No significant difference was found in the rate of *de novo* purine synthesis at diagnosis between the patients with wild-type *ITPA* (median 90.8 fmol/nmol/h, range 0–5,018, *n* = 171) and variant *ITPA* (median 52.8 fmol/nmol/h, range 0–1,441, *n* = 25) or between those with wild-type *TPMT* (median 89.6 fmol/nmol/h, range 0–5,018, *n* = 186) and variant *TPMT* (median 33.8 fmol/nmol/h, range 0.82–819.1, *n* = 10); no significant effect was found even when analyzed by the multilocus genotypes. The lack of an effect of *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotype was confirmed by multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, race, sex, and treatment arm.

### Effect of TPMT/ITPA genotypes on mercaptopurine metabolites in bone marrow leukemia cells after initial therapy with mercaptopurine (Total 13B)

These studies were performed in the subgroup of patients treated with mercaptopurine alone: estimations were performed in 56 patients; TGN was measurable in only 49 patients because for 7 patients the assay failed for technical reasons. Neither *ITPA* nor *TPMT* genotypes were significantly related to TGN levels in bone marrow ALL cells from patients treated with an initial single dose of intravenous high-dose mercaptopurine, even after adjusting for the potential confounders: age, race, and sex ([Figure 2](#F2)). MMPN concentrations were significantly higher in patients with a variant *ITPA* allele and lower in those with a variant *TPMT* allele, both as per univariate analysis (*ITPA* variant vs. *ITPA* wild type, *P* = 0.0038; *TPMT* variant vs. *TPMT* wild type, *P* = 0.026) and in the pairwise analysis for the multilocus genotype (*TPMT* wild type/*ITPA* variant vs. *TPMT* wild type/*ITPA* wild type, *P* = 0.0056; *TPMT* variant/*ITPA* wild type vs. *TPMT* wild type/*ITPA* wild type, *P* = 0.030, [Figure 3](#F3)). Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, race, sex, and treatment arm confirmed, after initial treatment with mercaptopurine, the significant effect of the *ITPA* genotype (*P* = 0.00030), but not the *TPMT* genotype (*P* = 0.060), on MMPN concentrations. Boxplots showing mercaptopurine metabolite concentrations independently for *ITPA* and *TPMT* genotypes are available in [Supplementary Data S1](#SD1) online ([Figures 1S and 2S](#SD1), respectively).

### Effect of TPMT/ITPA genotypes on mercaptopurine metabolites in erythrocytes during continuation therapy that includes mercaptopurine (Total 13B)

Concentrations of thiopurine metabolites were measured in erythrocytes obtained during continuation therapy with chronic oral mercaptopurine (75 mg/m^2^ daily). For TGN, 534 estimations were made in 113 patients (median of five measurements per patient, range 1–9); the median concentration measured for each patient was 267.5 pmol/8 × 10^8^ erythrocytes (range 58.4–1,023.0 pmol/8 × 10^8^) and, as a measure of intrapatient variability, the median interquartile range across patients was 82.2 (range 0.10–499.80 pmol/8 × 10^8^). For MMPN, 278 measurements were made in 107 patients (median of two measurements per patient, range 1–8); the median concentration measured for each patient was 10,440.0 pmol/8 × 10^8^ erythrocytes (range 54.5–37,780.0 pmol/8 × 10^8^) and, as a measure of intrapatient variability, the median interquartile range across patients was 2,776.0 (range 21.0–13,730.0 pmol/8 × 10^8^). TGN concentrations ([Figure 4](#F4)) were higher in patients with the variant *TPMT* genotype (*TPMT* variant vs. *TPMT* wild-type, *P* = 0.0077); no effect of *ITPA* genotype on TGN was found (*ITPA* variant vs. *ITPA* wild type, *P* = 0.95). Pairwise analysis of the multilocus genotype confirmed the effect of *TPMT* only on TGN concentrations. MMPN concentrations ([Figure 5](#F5)) were higher in patients with a variant *ITPA* allele and lower in those with a variant *TPMT* allele, both as per univariate analysis (*ITPA* variant vs. *ITPA* wild type, *P* = 0.0057; *TPMT* variant vs. *TPMT* wild type, *P* = 0.032) and in the pairwise analysis for the multilocus genotype (*TPMT* wild type/*ITPA* variant vs. *TPMT* wild type/*ITPA* wild type, *P* = 0.0086; *TPMT* variant/*ITPA* wild type vs. *TPMT* wild type/*ITPA* wild type, *P* = 0.048). No significant effect of age, race, or sex on any of these correlations was found. Boxplots showing mercaptopurine metabolite concentrations independently for *ITPA* and *TPMT* genotypes are available in [Supplementary Data S1](#SD1) online ([Figure 3S and 4S](#SD1), respectively).

Mercaptopurine doses were adjusted for TPMT genotype so as to avoid toxic TGN concentrations. Red-blood-cell TGN concentrations differed by TPMT genotype, resulting in higher concentrations (P = 0.0095, pairwise Wilcoxon test) in patients with a multilocus genotype of TPMT variant/ITPA wild type than in patients with a wild-type genotype for both genes.

Multilocus TPMT/ITPA genotype and median concentrations of mercaptopurine metabolite methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (MMPN) measured during chronic treatment with mercaptopurine in accordance with the St Jude Total 13B protocol. Mercaptopurine doses were adjusted for TPMT genotype so as to avoid toxic TGN concentrations. Red-blood-cell MMPN concentrations differed among patients according to TPMT/ITPA genotypes, showing higher concentrations in patients with a multilocus genotype TPMT wild type/ITPA variant (P = 0.0086, pairwise Wilcoxon test) and lower concentrations in patients with a multilocus genotype of TPMT variant/ITPA wild type (P = 0.048, pairwise Wilcoxon test) as compared to patients who were wild type for both loci. Boxes include data between the 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers indicate the minimal and maximal values excluding the outliers. ITPA, inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase; TPMT, thiopurine S-methyltransferase.

### TPMT and ITPA genotypes and mercaptopurine dose adjustment during continuation therapy (Total 13B)

The dose of mercaptopurine was adjusted for patients enrolled in the Total 13B protocol, in accordance with patient tolerance and *TPMT* genotype. Among the 205 patients who completed treatment, 8 (3.9%) had a variant *TPMT* genotype. Among the 197 patients with wild-type *TPMT*, 6 (3.0%) were on a mercaptopurine dose that had been reduced by 30% or more by completion of therapy. Among the 8 patients with variant *TPMT*, 2 (25.0%) were taking a dose reduced by 30% or more; the probability of being prescribed a lower dose of mercaptopurine was significantly higher for those with a *TPMT* variant allele than for those with a wild-type allele (odds ratio (OR) = 10.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8–63.9; *P* = 0.0099). This was confirmed in a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, race, sex, and treatment arm. None of the patients with a variant *ITPA* genotype was found to be on a reduced dose of mercaptopurine at the end of the treatment, and there was no statistical evidence for a relationship between *ITPA* genotype and mercaptopurine dose reduction during continuation therapy.

### Effect of TPMT/ITPA genotypes on the incidence of toxicity

During continuation therapy in the Total 13B protocol, in which mercaptopurine doses were adjusted on the basis of *TPMT* genotype and mercaptopurine metabolite concentrations, children with an *ITPA* variant allele experienced a higher incidence of grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia as compared with children with a homozygous wild-type *ITPA* genotype (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.2–7.3; *P* = 0.018, [Table 2](#T2)). There was no significant difference in the incidence of grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia in children with the *TPMT* variant allele as compared to those with a homozygous wild-type *TPMT* genotype (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.3–6.9; *P* = 0.71). Cumulative incidence curves for grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia during continuation therapy, in relation to *ITPA* genotype, are shown in [Figure 6](#F6).

### Table 2.

|   | OR (95% CI) | P value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ITPA variant vs. ITPA wild type | 2.98 (1.21–7.35) | 0.018 |
| Age |  |  |
| <1 Year vs. 1–10 years | 0.57 (0.06–5.49) | 0.063 |

ITPA genotype and cumulative incidence curves for the risk of grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during chronic continuation therapy that included mercaptopurine in accordance with the St Jude Total 13B protocol. At day 900 of maintenance therapy, the estimate of incidence of these adverse events was 10.7% ± 2.2 in patients with wild-type ITPA and 26.6% ± 7.8 in patients with variant ITPA. ITPA, inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase; TPMT, thiopurine S-methyltransferase.

A significantly higher proportion of children with grade 4 febrile neutropenia have an ITPA variant allele when compared with children with no febrile neutropenia or children with grade 1–2 febrile neutropenia (excluding grade 3) (OR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.3–20.9; *P* = 0.021).

There was no significant effect of age, ethnicity, or sex on any correlation of toxicity with the *TPMT* or *ITPA* genotypes described. None of the other toxicities that were evaluated (e.g., gastrointestinal toxicity and infection) was significantly associated with the *ITPA* or *TPMT* genotype in patients enrolled in the Total 13B protocol.

During continuation therapy in the Total 12 protocol, in which mercaptopurine doses were not adjusted on the basis of *TPMT* genotype, children with a *TPMT* variant allele experienced a higher incidence of grade 3/4 infection as compared with children with a homozygous wild-type *TPMT* genotype (OR = 4.1; 95% CI = 1.2–14.0; *P* = 0.026). There was no significant difference in the incidence of grade 3/4 infection in children with the *ITPA* variant allele as compared to those with a homozygous wild-type genotype (OR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.34–2.4; *P* = 0.84). Age, ethnicity, and sex had no significant effect on the incidence of grade 3/grade 4 infection. Gastrointestinal toxicity, which was the other evaluated toxicity, was not significantly associated with the *ITPA* or *TPMT* genotype in patients enrolled in the Total 12 protocol.

### Effect of TPMT/ITPA genotypes on the efficacy of treatment in patients treated according to Total 13B protocol

With aggressive supportive care of treatment-related toxicities, no significant effect of the *TPMT* or *ITPA* genotypes was found on the long-term efficacy of treatment, measured as event-free survival at 5, 8, or 10 years after diagnosis.

## DISCUSSION

This study has documented that inheritance of a nonfunctional variant allele for either *TPMT* or *ITPA* is associated with significant modification in the metabolism of mercaptopurine during treatment of ALL. Although the importance of the *TPMT* genetic polymorphism is very well known and characterized,[8](#R8)^–^[10](#R10)^,^[32](#R32) this is the first report showing a significant effect of the *ITPA* genetic polymorphism in the context of mercaptopurine therapy individualized on the basis of *TPMT* genotype. Here we document significantly higher concentrations of the methylated nucleotide metabolites of mercaptopurine in leukemia cells and erythrocytes of patients who have inherited a nonfunctional *ITPA* allele. In contrast, inheritance of a variant *ITPA* allele was not associated with differences in TGN concentrations in either leukemia cells or erythrocytes. Although *ITPA* is known to be involved in mercaptopurine metabolism ([Figure 1](#F1)), the mechanism by which *ITPA* variant alleles influence the accumulation of methylated thionucleotides has not been fully elucidated.

It is known that individuals with reduced activity of ITPA have physiologically higher concentrations of the endogenous nucleotide, ITP.[25](#R25) The methylated nucleotide metabolites of mercaptopurine can be produced by direct methylation of thioITP by TPMT;[15](#R15) alternatively, methylthioITP can be produced by conversion of methylthioIMP to methylthioITP, as is known to occur with the physiological nucleotides.[33](#R33) Interestingly, it has been recently shown that methylthioITP has less affinity for ITPA than does thioITP, and this could account for the greater accumulation of methylthioITP in patients with ITPA deficiency (i.e., *ITPA* heterozygotes).[24](#R24) The assay we used to measure these nucleotide concentrations does not discriminate among the mono-, di-, and triphosphate nucleotides,[33](#R33) and therefore it is not known whether one or all of these nucleotides were affected by the reduction in ITPA activity; however, because ITPA primarily cleaves thioITP to thioIMP, patients with reduced ITPA activity (i.e., patients with the *ITPA* variant) should have an increased concentration of primarily the triphosphate nucleotide (thioITP), leading to an accumulation of methylthioITP, documented in this study as an increase in MMPN.

The level of *de novo* purine synthesis can influence mercaptopurine pharmacology, but our studies revealed no relationship between *de novo* purine synthesis in ALL cells and *ITPA* genotype.

These studies reveal that the cumulative incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients receiving a chemotherapy protocol that includes mercaptopurine individualized for *TPMT* is significantly greater among those who have inherited an *ITPA* variant allele. The association was particularly evident during the second half of continuation therapy ([Figure 6](#F6)), when the treatment was predominantly chronic (i.e., daily mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate treatment[31](#R31)), and remained significant when the analysis was limited to only life-threatening events (i.e., grade 4 fever and neutropenia). Febrile neutropenia in cancer patients is a serious complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and it generally leads to hospitalization for evaluation and treatment. Even when properly treated it can be associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs.[34](#R34)^–^[37](#R37) Moreover, febrile neutropenia leads to treatment delays and reductions in chemotherapy dosage, which may negatively affect the long-term outcome of the treatment for malignancy.[34](#R34)^–^[37](#R37) In the current analysis, *ITPA* genotype was shown to have a significant influence on the risk of fever and neutropenia (and the morbidity and costs associated with its treatment), but fortunately this did not influence event-free survival in the patients. We postulate that, although the *ITPA* polymorphism significantly influences the risk of toxicity (febrile neutropenia), this did not influence the efficacy of the treatment because we immediately and aggressively treated febrile neutropenia with antibiotics, assuming it to be a result of infection until proven otherwise. By avoiding toxicity-related deaths associated with the higher frequency of fever and neutropenia, there was no adverse effect of *ITPA* polymorphism on the efficacy of ALL therapy. Given the higher risk of this toxicity, patients with variant *ITPA* and wild-type *TPMT* should be closely monitored for the risk of febrile neutropenia during treatment with mercaptopurine.

The higher frequency of febrile neutropenia observed in patients with a variant *ITPA* allele may have been caused by the higher concentration of methylated thiopurine nucleotides that we documented in patients with a variant nonfunctional *ITPA* allele; these metabolites are known to have cytotoxic properties, and their accumulation may contribute to a more persistent neutropenia, increasing the likelihood of febrile neutropenia events.[9](#R9)^,^[38](#R38)

It is also noteworthy that in a prior cohort of St Jude patients with ALL whose mercaptopurine doses were not adjusted on the basis of *TPMT* genotype or TGN concentrations (St Jude Protocol Total 12, 1988–1991)[39](#R39) we documented a higher probability of grade 3/4 infections in patients who had inherited *TPMT* deficiency, but that this was not significantly associated with *ITPA* genotype ([Figure 7](#F7)). That is, if mercaptopurine doses are not individualized on the basis of *TPMT* genotype, then *TPMT* will be the predominant determinant of severe hematopoietic toxicity; whereas, if doses are adjusted for *TPMT*, then *ITPA* has a significant influence on the risk of febrile neutropenia.

TPMT genotype, ITPA genotype, and the odds ratio of severe toxicity during continuation therapy of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia for whom the dose of mercaptopurine was not adjusted on the basis of TPMT genotype (St Jude Total 12) and in those for whom the dose was adjusted on the basis of TPMT genotype (St Jude Total 13B). Toxicity measured prospectively according to the Total 12 protocol (i.e., no mercaptopurine dose adjustment on the basis of TPMT) was grade 3/4 infection, whereas the comparable toxicity measured according to the Total 13B (i.e., mercaptopurine dose adjusted for TPMT) was grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia. Odds ratios are from a weighted logistic regression model and are adjusted for treatment arm and patient’s age, race, and sex. ITPA, inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase; TPMT, thiopurine S-methyltransferase. v, variant allele; wt, wild-type allele.

All previous studies that evaluated the role of *ITPA* polymorphism in the toxicity of thiopurine have been carried out in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, with contradictory results.[17](#R17)^–^[24](#R24) Most of these studies involved patients on doses of mercaptopurine that were not systematically adjusted on the basis of *TPMT* genotype, and our findings indicate that this is probably the reason for the inconsistent results relating to the effect of *ITPA* in these earlier studies.

In summary, we have shown that genetic polymorphism of *ITPA* (rs41320251) is a significant determinant of mercaptopurine metabolism and of severe, life-threatening febrile neutropenia during treatment in patients with ALL who are treated with combination chemotherapy involving mercaptopurine doses individualized on the basis of *TPMT* genotype and the concentration of TGNs. This illustrates the evolution of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice; as treatment is individualized for one genetic determinant of drug response, the importance of other genetic polymorphisms emerges.

## METHODS

### Patients

We studied children enrolled as patients in two single-institution clinical protocols for the treatment of newly diagnosed ALL. All the patients and/or their parents provided informed consent for the institutional review board–approved protocols.

The study was initially focused on patients receiving treatment according to the Total 13B protocol to assess the associations between different clinical and pharmacological phenotypes related to mercaptopurine treatment. For patients enrolled in the Total 12 protocol, only toxicity was analyzed for its relation to *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes.

For both the Total 12 and Total 13B protocols, the therapy schedule has been previously described in detail (refs. [31](#R31)^,^[39](#R39); see [Supplementary Data S1](#SD1) online). Of the 188 patients enrolled in the Total 12 protocol, 101 had genomic DNA samples available for inclusion in this analysis. Of the 247 patients who were enrolled in the St Jude Total 13B protocol, 246 had genomic DNA samples available for inclusion in this analysis.[3](#R3)

### Genotyping

The major nonfunctional variant alleles of *TPMT* (*TPMT**2, *TPMT**3A, and *TPMT**3C, defined by SNPs rs1142345, rs1800460, and rs1800462) were determined using methods that we have previously described in detail;[32](#R32)^,^[40](#R40) the major nonfunctional variant allele of ITPA (SNP rs41320251) was genotyped on the basis of a specific probe (SNP_A-1646349) in the Affymetrix chip array (Mapping50K_Hind240) and confirmed using a TaqMan assay (Prometheus Labs, San Diego, CA). All genotyping was done on germline DNA extracted from patients’ blood samples.

### Rate of de novo purine synthesis in leukemic blasts

In patients enrolled in the Total 13B protocol, the rate of *de novo* purine synthesis in treatment-naive bone marrow ALL cells was determined by quantifying unlabeled and radio-labeled purine bases (adenine and guanine) after acid hydrolysis of a 2-h *ex vivo* incubation of lymphoblasts with ^14^C-formate using methods that we have previously described in detail.[41](#R41)

### Measurement of mercaptopurine metabolites in leukemia cells

In patients enrolled in the Total 13B protocol, concentrations of mercaptopurine metabolites (TGN and MMPN) were measured in bone marrow ALL cells using methods that we have previously described in detail.[33](#R33) These analyses were performed on leukemia cells obtained after initial therapy with mercaptopurine in a subgroup of patients whose initial therapy consisted of a single intravenous infusion of mercaptopurine (1,000 mg/m^2^ infused IV over 6 h); the other patients received initial therapy with a combination of mercaptopurine and methotrexate and were therefore not included in the analysis of mercaptopurine metabolism in ALL cells.[31](#R31)

### Measurement of mercaptopurine metabolites in erythrocytes

The concentrations of the two principal metabolites (TGN and MMPN) were measured in patients’ erythrocytes using previously described methods.[42](#R42)^,^[43](#R43) Samples were collected during continuation therapy from patients who were compliant with their mercaptopurine therapy and who had taken a stable dose for at least 12 of the prior 14 days; the median value of multiple measurements relating to each patient was used in the analyses.

### Mercaptopurine dose adjustment during continuation chemotherapy

For patients enrolled in the Total 12 protocol, the dose of mercaptopurine was 75 mg/m^2^, and it was not adjusted prospectively for *TPMT* genotype. Rather, the mercaptopurine dose was modified only if patients developed dose-limiting toxicity attributable to mercaptopurine.[10](#R10) For those enrolled in the Total 13B protocol, the standard dose of mercaptopurine was 75 mg/m^2^, but the dose was adjusted prospectively according to each patient’s *TPMT* genotype and tolerance to therapy (see [Supplementary Data S1](#SD1) online).

### Toxicity

Of the 246 patients enrolled in this study, 240 were evaluable for the toxicity analysis: 5 patients with Down syndrome and 1 patient with cystic fibrosis were excluded because their underlying conditions could influence toxicity. During continuation therapy, adverse events were documented and graded prospectively using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 1.0, as previously described.[3](#R3) For the analyses, the estimation of toxicity was dichotomized as “present” (grades 3–4) or “absent” (grades 0–2). The toxicities considered in this study were febrile neutropenia, gastrointestinal toxicity, and infection in those on the Total 13B protocol; and gastrointestinal toxicity and infection for those on the Total 12 protocol. Febrile neutropenia events were not recorded independently of infection for the Total 12 protocol patients. For patients enrolled in the Total 13B protocol, a separate analysis was carried out to compare the incidence of grade 4 febrile neutropenia with the incidence of nil febrile neutropenia and of grades 1 and 2 febrile neutropenia, separately from grade 3 events.

### Efficacy of treatment

Efficacy of treatment was defined as event-free survival and overall survival at 5, 8, and 10 years after the diagnosis of leukemia.

### Statistical analysis

The associations between the genotypes and the pharmacological or metabolic phenotypes were evaluated using Wilcoxon test for two-group comparisons and pairwise comparisons among multiple groups defined by the multilocus genotypes.

Logistic regression was used to assess the association between mercaptopurine dose reductions at the end of treatment and *TPMT* and *ITPA* genotypes.

A weighted logistic regression model that takes time at risk of each patient into account[3](#R3) was used to test the association between genotype and incidence of the toxicity events.

Event-free survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and were compared between genotypes using the log rank test (see [Supplementary Data S1](#SD1) online).

To test for potential confounders, all associations between the considered phenotypes and the genotypes were confirmed by multivariate analyses using linear or generalized linear models (see [Supplementary Data S1](#SD1) online).

Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 Service Pack 4 (SAS institute, Cary, NC) and R version 2.6.1 ([http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org)).
