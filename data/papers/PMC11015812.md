## Abstract

**Methods:** 
Retention and survival time since admission (June 1993 - June 2022) until leaving treatment (for retention), or at the end of follow-up (Dec 2022) (for retention and survival) were analyzed in 488 patients. Vital data was taken from a national registry. Predictors were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models.

**Results:** 
Longer retention and survival were found for carriers of the T allele of SNP rs204076. This SNP is associated with OPRD1 expression in cortex (GTEx). Carriers of the T allele (n = 251) survived longer compared to non-carriers (24.7 vs. 20.2 years, p = 0.005) and had longer retention (11.2 vs. 8.8 years, p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis identified the T allele as an independent predictor of longer survival time (p = 0.003) and retention (p = 0.009). Additional predictors for survival were no benzodiazepine use after one year in MMT, no hepatitis C, <20 years of opioid usage and admission at age < 30, and for longer retention were no use of other drugs except opioids on admission, and no drugs at one year, as well as methadone dose ≥ 100 mg/d at one year and axis I & II DSM-5 psychiatric diagnosis.

**Conclusions:** 
The OPRD1 SNP rs204076 and non-genetic predictors contribute to survival time and retention in MMT patients.

### Methods:

Retention and survival time since admission (June 1993 - June 2022) until leaving treatment (for retention), or at the end of follow-up (Dec 2022) (for retention and survival) were analyzed in 488 patients. Vital data was taken from a national registry. Predictors were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models.

### Results:

Longer retention and survival were found for carriers of the T allele of SNP rs204076. This SNP is associated with *OPRD1* expression in cortex (GTEx). Carriers of the T allele (n = 251) survived longer compared to non-carriers (24.7 vs. 20.2 years, p = 0.005) and had longer retention (11.2 vs. 8.8 years, p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis identified the T allele as an independent predictor of longer survival time (p = 0.003) and retention (p = 0.009). Additional predictors for survival were no benzodiazepine use after one year in MMT, no hepatitis C, <20 years of opioid usage and admission at age < 30, and for longer retention were no use of other drugs except opioids on admission, and no drugs at one year, as well as methadone dose ≥ 100 mg/d at one year and axis I & II DSM-5 psychiatric diagnosis.

### Conclusions:

The *OPRD1* SNP rs204076 and non-genetic predictors contribute to survival time and retention in MMT patients.

## 1. Background

Maintenance treatment with methadone ([NIH Consensus Statement, 1998](#R20)) or buprenorphine ([Bart, 2012](#R1)) is the most effective therapeutic approach to opioid use disorder (OUD). Maintenance treatment is strongly associated with harm reduction, a decrease in death rate, such as overdose ([Faggiano et al., 2021](#R8)), a reduction of opioid use, as well as a reduction of other complications when compared with individuals with OUD with no maintenance. Retention, one of the most common and accepted measurements of maintenance treatment outcome, is considered to be superior in treatment with the full mu-opioid receptor agonist methadone than treatment with the partial mu-opioid receptor agonist buprenorphine (for review see [Mattick et al., 2014](#R18)).

Our previous study on retention and survival ([Peles et al., 2018](#R22)) of the 890 patients who were admitted to our methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) clinic over 24 years, found younger age (< 40 years), no hepatitis C or B, no HIV, and no benzodiazepines (BDZ) use after one year in treatment, to predict longer survival (multivariate analyses). Longer retention (up to 25 years) was predicted by no opioids or BDZ use after one year, methadone dose ≥100 mg/day, no DSM-IV-TR Axis II diagnosis only, and no direct hospital referral. The results were similar to earlier analyses of 15 years of follow-up of our cohort ([Peles et al., 2010](#R21)).

In both evaluations of survival, the most prevalent cause of death was cancer ([Peles et al., 2010](#R21); [2018](#R22)). This is not surprising since cancer risk increases with age. It is consistent with a national study of patients from Israel receiving MMT that found excessive deaths due to “natural causes” (medical conditions, mainly cancer)([Rosca et al., 2012](#R23)). A recent study from Spain (Jiménez-Treviño et al., 2020) that includes 214 individuals with OUD who entered MMT between 1982 and 1984, found that 146 of the 195 patients with information deceased after 35 years. Of the survivors, 5.7% were still enrolled in MMT. They concluded that there is a high long-term mortality rate among individuals with OUD, even after enrollment in MMT. Hser et al. literature review ([Hser et al., 2015](#R13)) also revealed excess mortality and morbidity among individuals with OUD compared to the general population but showed considerable regional differences in mortality and causes of death.

Molecular genetic studies of substance use disorders (SUD) have seen big advances during the past several years. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genomic loci significantly associated with multiple SUD, including variants in *OPRM1*, *DRD2*, *PDE4B*, *FURIN*, *CHRNA5*, and *ADH1B* (e.g., [Deak 2022](#R7), [Gaddis 2022](#R9), [Hatoum 2023](#R10). for review see [Deak and Johnson, 2021](#R6)).

Previous candidate gene association studies including a study from our group ([Levran et al., 2008](#R16)) identified associations between *OPRD1* SNPs and SUD to opioids/heroin, alcohol, and cocaine. A clinical trial identified an *OPRD1* SNP association with MMT efficacy in African Americans but not in European Americans (for review see [Crist and Clark, 2018](#R4)).

The delta-opioid receptor is encoded by *OPRD1* and is targeted by enkephalins. It is not the primary target of opioids or methadone, but it is involved in various brain processes, including reward, learning, memory, anxiety, and impulsivity ([Chu & Kieffer, 2013](#R3)). Activation of the delta-opioid receptor by exogenous opioids results in signaling through reward pathways. It is therefore possible that variants in *OPRD1* will affect MMT efficacy and outcome.

The study goal was to assess whether variants in the delta opioid receptor gene, *OPRD1*, predict the survival and retention of patients in MMT. We therefore, added the genetic variables to the common sociodemographic and addiction variables analysis.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Study population and Study variables

The Adelson Clinic for Drug Abuse Treatment and Research was established in 1993 and treats adult individuals (≥18 years of age) diagnosed with DSM-IV or DSM-5 opioid use disorder who have experienced at least two unsuccessful institutional withdrawal attempts. Of the patients who were admitted to MMT (administrated a minimum of one daily methadone dose) between 1993 and June 2022 (n = 1072), the current study includes a cohort of 488 patients who have genetic data. This cohort includes patients admitted to MMT since 2004, when the genetic study was initiated, as well as those who were admitted between 1993–2003 and were still in treatment in 2004. The characteristics of the cohort are presented in [Table 1](#T1). For details on our MMT clinic see [Peles et al. (2010](#R21), [2018)](#R22). In brief, patients drink their individually adjusted daily dose of methadone in the clinic but can “earn” the privilege to receive up to 13 “take-home” methadone doses, based on good conduct and prolonged drug abstinence. Each patient regularly attends individual psychosocial therapy sessions as well as diverse group therapy meetings. The clinic has been CARF International accredited since 2008, even though this is not required in Israel. The clinic staff is trained to maintain a compassionate attitude and to accept that addiction is a medical disease, which can be treated in part by an adequate dose of methadone. Reasons for leaving MMT could be drop out, arrest/jail, expulsion (only due to violent aggressive behavior or selling drugs within the clinic), referral to rehabilitation, hospitalization, transfer to another MMT clinic or move (change of address), and end of treatment.

Table 1 Caption: Comparison between carriers and non-carriers of the OPRD1 rs204076 T allele (dominant model)

Retention time (years) was calculated from the first admission to MMT (between June 1993 - June 2022) until leaving treatment or the end of the follow-up (December 2022). Survival time (years) was calculated from first admission to MMT (between June 1993 - June 2022) until death or the end of follow-up (August 2022, when vital status was determined based on the Israel National Population Registry which records all deaths in the country).

Predictors for retention and survival time were determined using Kaplan Meier and Cox models. Demographic and sociodemographic data were collected from patients’ charts.

### 2.2. Urine toxicology and methadone dose

Random and observed urine samples were routinely collected twice a month. Each test was analyzed for opioids, cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine), benzodiazepine (BDZ), and cannabis using enzyme immunoassay systems (DRI^®^ and CEDIA^®^) ([Hawks, 1986](#R11)). “Positive” (use) classification for each drug is defined if at least one urine sample for the drug was positive during the first month (admission) or after one year (month 13) of treatment. If patients left treatment before 13 months but had stayed for more than four months, the use of each of these drugs during the last month of treatment was recorded. Methadone dosage at one year of treatment was used for analyses. If a patient left before one year, but stayed at least four months, the dose of the last month in treatment was used.

### 2.3. Genetic analysis

The study was approved by the Institute’s Institutional Review Board and all study participants provided written informed consent for genetic studies.

Genotyping was performed according to standard Illumina protocols using the Infinium Global Screening Array (GSA) 24 v3.0 BeadChip, at the Genomics Core Facility, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai. Microarray scan data was converted to genotypes using GenomeStudio 2.0. Standard QC protocols were used. A total of 18 SNPs from the array in the *OPRD1* region, with high quality and moderate to high allele frequency were analyzed.

### 2.4. Statistical analyses

Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Comparison between genotype groups, under the dominant and recessive model, was done with chi-square for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables. Survival and retention times were calculated from the first MMT admission until the patient died or left, respectively, or until the end of follow-up, using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Results are given as mean and 95% confidence interval [95%CI]. The Log-Rank test was used to test the statistical significance of the results. The variables that were found to significantly predict survival or retention times in a Kaplan-Meier analysis (*p* < 0.05) were included in the multivariate model (Cox regression analysis).

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Characteristics of patients with and without the OPRD1 SNP rs204076 T allele

Only one of the SNPs analyzed (rs204076) was significantly associated with retention and survival time under the dominant model. Carriers of the rs204076 T allele (genotypes TT and AT) (n = 251) did not differ from non-carriers (genotype AA) (n = 237) with respect to female proportion, age of opioid use onset, duration of usage before admission to MMT, age of admission to MMT, using other drugs of abuse, in addition to opioids, on admission to MMT, or reasons for leaving treatment ([Table 1](#T1)). The carriers of the rs204076 T allele had a lower percentage of cocaine in urine after one year of treatment (p = 0.01) and a lower percentage of deaths (p=0.01).

### 3.2. Cumulative retention

A total of 235 patients left treatment. The cumulative retention of carriers of the rs204076 T allele was significantly longer (11.2 years, 95% CI 9.8–12.7) than non-carriers (8.8 years, 95% CI 7.7–10.0, chi-square 4.4, p = 0.04) ([Figure 1](#F1), [Table 2](#T2)). [Table 2](#T2) lists the variables that were associated with longer retention. Among them are opioid usage of < 20 years, living with a partner, negative antibody test to hepatitis C, no cocaine or BDZ in urine on admission, and no opioids, cocaine, or BDZ in urine after one year in treatment, and methadone dose ≥ 100 mg/day at one year. When comparing cumulative retention by the variables and the genotype groups, the carriers of the rs204076 T allele group show longer retention for all variables.

### 3.3. Survival time

A total of 119 patients of the cohort died. Survival time, calculated from first admission, was significantly longer among the carriers of the rs204076 T allele group (p = 0.005). When comparing survival time by the variables and the genotype groups, the carriers of the rs204076 T allele group shows consistently longer times for all variables ([Table 3](#T3)). Among the variables with statistical significance are sex (p = 0.005), opioid usage (p = 0.006), education years (p = 0.003), drug injected (p = 0.006), as well as BDZ (p = 0.008), and any substance in urine (p = 0.005) following one year. The mean age of death was comparable between those who left (54.5±11.3) or stayed in MMT (55.9±10.2, p = 0.5). The age of death in females was significantly younger (49.1±9) than in males (56.7±10.5, p = 0.002). Females admitted to treatment at a younger age than males (35.9±8.6 vs. 44.9±10.5 respectively, p < 0.001), following a shorter duration of opioid usage (14.2±8.3 vs. 22±10.4 years, respectively, p < 0.001).

### 3.4. Retention and survival in the group without genetic data

The cumulative retention of the group without genetic data (n = 584) (6.2 years, 95% CI 5.5–6.9) was significantly shorter than each of the genetic groups (carriers of the rs204076 T allele or the rs204076 AA genotype) (p < 0.0005) ([Figure 1](#F1)). The survival of the group without genetic data (n = 584) (20.1 years, 95% CI 19–21) was significantly shorter than the carriers of the rs204076 T allele group (p = 0.001) but similar to that of the AA genetic group (p = 0.8) ([Figure 2](#F2)).

[Table 4b](#T4) shows the Cox regression model results for survival. Longer survival time was more likely among patients carrying the rs204076 T allele (p = 0.003). Additional variables were negative urine to BDZ after one year in MMT (p = 0.004), shorter duration of opioid usage (< 20 years; p = 0.048), younger age at admission to MMT (< 30 years; p = 0.018), and no antibodies for hepatitis C (p = 0.015).

### 3.6. Bioinformatics analysis

LD analysis revealed that SNP rs204076 is in high LD with several SNPs in *OPRD1* as well as the adjacent gene, *EPB41*, in populations of European ancestry. One of these SNPs is rs126014 which is located at a regulatory region in the 5’ UTR of *EPB41* (ENST00000646260) and is an eQTL for *EPB41* in cerebellum (The Genotype-Tissue Expression GTEx Consortium). The derived T allele of *OPRD1* SNP rs204076 and the ancestor G allele of *EPB41* SNP rs126014 are associated with lower expression of *OPRD1* in cortex, higher expression of *OPRD1* in testis, and lower expression of *EPB41* in cerebellum. Notably, there is low LD between the two SNPs in African populations. *OPRD1* SNP rs204076 is more common in European populations compared to other world populations (MAF of the T allele ~0.30 in Europe compared to 0.10–0.15 in the rest of the world). The frequency of SNP rs126014 is variable across the world.

## 4. Discussion

The current study shows that the delta-opioid receptor gene (*OPRD1*) variant is associated with long-term survival and retention of MMT patients. The delta opioid receptor is involved in various brain processes, related to drug addiction, including reward, learning processes, memory, anxiety, and impulsivity (Chang et al., 2013, [Crist and Clark, 2018](#R4)).

The variant T allele of the *OPRD1* 3’ UTR SNP rs204076 and expended list of non-genetic predictors were found to give an advantage in both retention in treatment and survival time in a big cohort of patients with OUD receiving methadone maintenance treatment. This variant was also associated with reduced cocaine use after one year in MMT in this cohort.

The cumulative retention of the 584 patients with no genetic data was significantly lower than each of the two rs204076 genotype groups. This is reasonable since one of the reasons for not participating in the genetic study is leaving treatment before 2004 when the genetic study started. Interestingly, with respect to survival, our 584 patients with no genetic data were comparable to the rs204076 AA genotype group and demonstrated shorter survival than the rs204076 T allele carriers’ group, which is characterized by superior survival and retention. While retention reflects success in MMT, those who left do not necessarily reflect failure, although most studies suggested it. Some patients may move to other facilities, or taper dose to end MMT aiming for prolonged abstinence, but the majority would just leave, with some being expelled or incarcerated. In the current study, there was no difference in the reasons for leaving between the genetic groups, and we only have the vital data as a follow-up outcome. Since vital data is highly related to age, a longer follow-up is warranted.

Population-specific linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns are essential for biomedical research. A study can be based on the genotypes of a small fraction of variants to “tag” other highly correlated variants that may be the functional variants that explain the observed signal. The extended LD block between *OPRD1* 3’ region and its adjacent gene, *EPB41*, which was also indicated in our previous study ([Levran et al., 2021](#R17)), is intriguing. This block includes the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) rs204076 which was shown to be associated with *OPRD1* expression in cortex (GTEx) and the eQTL rs126014 which is located in a regulatory region of *EPB41* and is associated with *EPB41* expression in cerebellum.

*EPB41* encodes the erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 (protein 4.1R) and is important for red blood cell morphology and membrane function. It promotes the interaction between spectrin and actin in the membrane cytoskeleton and acts as a hub for the organization of membrane protein ([Baines et al., 2014](#R2)). A previous study indicated several *EPB41* SNPs in male-specific association with smoking abstinence ([Lee, 2012](#R15)). This data suggests a long-range functional connection between *OPRD1* and *EPB41* in non-African populations.

The importance of the findings is that they are independent of the well-established variables that predict retention in MMT, such as no polydrug use at admission, no use of any substance after one year in treatment, adequate high methadone dose ≥ 100 mg, as well as variables that predict survival such as older age, longer duration of opioid usage, having antibody to hepatitis C, and BDZ use. For example, in our cohort, patients with a long history of opioid usage of ≥ 20 years present shorter retention in MMT, but carriers of the rs204076 T allele had significantly longer retention. Another example is patients with no BDZ at admission, which had longer retention than patients with BDZ at admission (11.9 vs. 8.7 years). Carriers of the T allele had even longer retention than non-carriers (13.7 vs. 10 years). The multivariate analyses identified the rs204076 TT/AT genotype as an independent variable together with no polydrug use on admission, no use of any substance of abuse after one year in treatment and having both Axis I and II DSM-5 psychiatric diagnosis.

Surprisingly, survival was longer among patients who left treatment in the current study. It could be explained by the fact that a younger age of admission to MMT predicts shorter retention in MMT. Indeed, younger age characterizes those who left, and therefore survival time since admission to MMT was longer, even though they left treatment. The mean age of death was comparable between those who left or stayed in MMT. Notably, studies that divide the cohort to patients who left treatment before one year or after one year, including our previous studies, found longer survival in those who stayed their first year in MMT ([Peles et al., 2018](#R22); Huang et al., 2021).

In the current study, the survival time differed between genders, with a longer survival duration for females, and age is most likely related to that. Females were admitted to treatment at a younger age than males, following a shorter duration of opioid usage, a phenomenon that is known as a telescoping effect (a more rapid deterioration to addiction after opioid use onset) ([Hernandez-Avila et al., 2004](#R12)). However, the age of death in females was significantly younger than in males but was independent of whether they stayed or left MMT. Interestingly, while the leading cause of death was cancer (17.5%) among males, in females it was overdose (27%).

In summary, The *OPRD1* SNP rs204076, or other proxy SNPs, that are associated with the expression of *OPRD1* and *EPB41* may contribute to longer survival time and retention among MMT patients, in addition to non-genetic factors. The clinical relevance of variation in *OPRD1* expression to survival or retention cannot be confirmed by the current study. Further studies with longer follow-up and larger sample size are warranted to ascertain the role of *OPRD1* genetic variants as predictors of survival and retention in MMT.
