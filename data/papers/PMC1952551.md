## Abstract

QUESTION Recently a newborn died from morphine poisoning when hismother used codeine while breastfeeding. Many patients receive codeine for postlabour pain. Is it safe to prescribe codeine for nursing mothers?

ANSWER When a mother is an ultrarapid metabolizer of cytochrome P450 2D6, she produces much more morphine when taking codeine than most people do. In this situation, newborns might be exposed to toxic levels of morphine when breastfeeding. Options to reduce this risk include discontinuing codeine after 2 to 3 days of use and being aware of symptoms of potential opioid toxicity in both mothers and newborns.

## Case

## Genotype analysis

To address the potential contribution of pharmacogenetic factors to maternal response and neonatal outcome following codeine administration, genotype analysis was conducted for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP 2D6), the enzyme catalyzing the O-demethylation of codeine to morphine,[4](#b4-0530033) and for uridine diphosphate–dependent glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT 2B7), the enzyme catalyzing the formation of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G).[5](#b5-0530033)

The mother was found to be compound heterozygous for a CYP 2D6*2A allele and a CYP 2D6*2x2 gene duplication. In essence, the mother had 3 functional CYP 2D6 genes and would be classified as an ultrarapid metabolizer. The phenotypic consequence of this genotype is enhanced formation of morphine from codeine, consistent with the symptoms of somnolence and constipation that she experienced with the initial doses of Tylenol^®^ 3. Both the father and the infant possessed 2 functional CYP 2D6 alleles (CYP 2D6*1/*2 genotypes). Both the mother and the infant were homozygous for the UGT 2B7*2 (-161TT, 802TT) allele, which has been associated with increased M6G:morphine compared with the UGT 2B7*1 allele (-161C, 802C).[6](#b6-0530033)^,^[7](#b7-0530033) Morphine-6-glucuronide is a highly active metabolite of morphine.

## Discussion

The clinical and toxicologic pictures in this case are consistent with opioid toxicity leading to neonatal death. Codeine itself has only mild opioid properties, while most of its analgesia and central nervous system–depressant effects are secondary to its biotransformation to morphine, a reaction catalyzed by CYP 2D6.[5](#b5-0530033) While most people are extensive metabolizers of codeine to morphine, CYP 2D6 gene duplication results in an ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype (in an estimated 1% of people in Finland and Denmark, 10% of people in Greece and Portugal, and 29% of people in Ethiopia) and, thus, the potential for substantially increased production of morphine from codeine.[8](#b8-0530033) In adults, this has been shown to result in serious opioid toxicity even with small doses of codeine,[6](#b6-0530033) an observation consistent with the symptoms of opiate excess experienced by the mother in this case. Furthermore, the high levels of morphine in the breast milk in this case (86 ng/mL) corroborate the clinical picture observed in the infant. Breastfed infants of mothers prescribed 60 mg of codeine for postnatal pain achieved maximum plasma morphine concentrations of only 2.2 ng/mL.[7](#b7-0530033) In our case, a milk sample was available only for a period when the mother halved her dose. Hence, assuming linear kinetics, it is likely that peak levels of morphine in the milk were approximately 100 ng/mL.

The predominant routes of morphine elimination include biotransformation to M3G and M6G. The production of the active metabolite M6G is almost exclusively catalyzed by UGT 2B7.[9](#b9-0530033) Sawyer et al[10](#b10-0530033) reported increased M6G:morphine in individuals homozygous for the single nucleotide polymorphisms constituting the UGT 2B7*2 allele. Since the mother’s genotype was UGT 2B7*2/*2, it is possible that the infant might have also been exposed to higher than anticipated concentrations of the pharmacologically active M6G metabolite, and not just of morphine itself.

There are several previous reports of somnolence[11](#b11-0530033) and neonatal apnea[12](#b12-0530033) in babies exposed to codeine through breast milk, suggesting that varying degrees of opioid toxicity are more prevalent than commonly assumed. Codeine is widely perceived to be compatible with breastfeeding, owing to previously measured low levels of morphine in milk.[1](#b1-0530033)^,^[2](#b2-0530033) Our case reveals that polymorphism in CYP 2D6 and possibly UGT 2B7 can be life threatening for some breastfed babies. Given that a CYP 2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer genotype occurs at a frequency of 1% to 29%, genetic combination would be expected to occur quite commonly among breastfeeding mothers.

As demonstrated by this case, the common practice of prescribing codeine in the postpartum period cannot be regarded as safe for all breastfed infants. Therefore, we propose several clinical approaches that can be considered to prevent life-threatening neonatal toxicity, each with its benefits and disadvantages (**see box**). Whatever clinical approach is taken, codeine cannot be considered safe during breastfeeding.
