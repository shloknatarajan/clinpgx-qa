## Abstract

**Aims:** 
Antithyroid drug (ATD)‐induced agranulocytosis is a life‐threatening adverse drug reaction. Previous studies suggested that HLA genotypes may play an important role in ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. To examine the associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of pharmacogenomics studies.

**Methods:** 
We searched the MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases on 16 June 2018 for case–control studies on the associations between HLA genotypes with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias of included studies. We conducted random‐effects model meta‐analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis.

**Results:** 
We included 5 studies with 142 ATD‐induced agranulocytosis cases, 1529 matched ATD‐tolerant controls and 5945 healthy controls. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. ATD‐induced agranulocytosis was associated with HLA‐B*27:05 (OR 10.97; 95% CI 0.75–159.99), HLA‐B*38:02 (OR 19.85; 95% CI 7.94–49.57) and HLA‐DRB1*08:03 (OR 5.29; 95% CI 3.44–8.14). After excluding propylthiouracil, the associations of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis with HLA‐B*27:05 and HLA‐B*38:02 were strengthened (OR being 20.61 (95% CI 5.21–81.58) and 40.59 (95% CI 13.24–124.47), respectively). The associations of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis with HLA‐B*27:05, HLA‐B*38:02 and HLA‐DRB1*08:03 remained significant when compared to population controls (OR being 7.37 (95% CI 3.86–14.07), 36.43 (95% CI 12.80–103.70) and 5.42 (95% CI 2.36–12.47), respectively). HLA‐B*27:05, HLA‐B*38:02, and HLA‐DRB1*08:03 alleles were associated with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis, especially in carbimazole/methimazole‐induced agranulocytosis.

**Conclusions:** 
HLA‐B*27:05, HLA‐B*38:02 and HLA‐DRB1*08:03 alleles were associated with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis, especially in carbimazole/methimazole‐induced agranulocytosis.

### Aims

Antithyroid drug (ATD)‐induced agranulocytosis is a life‐threatening adverse drug reaction. Previous studies suggested that HLA genotypes may play an important role in ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. To examine the associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of pharmacogenomics studies.

### Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases on 16 June 2018 for case–control studies on the associations between HLA genotypes with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias of included studies. We conducted random‐effects model meta‐analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis.

### Results

We included 5 studies with 142 ATD‐induced agranulocytosis cases, 1529 matched ATD‐tolerant controls and 5945 healthy controls. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. ATD‐induced agranulocytosis was associated with *HLA‐B*27:05* (OR 10.97; 95% CI 0.75–159.99), *HLA‐B*38:02* (OR 19.85; 95% CI 7.94–49.57) and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* (OR 5.29; 95% CI 3.44–8.14). After excluding propylthiouracil, the associations of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis with *HLA‐B*27:05* and *HLA‐B*38:02* were strengthened (OR being 20.61 (95% CI 5.21–81.58) and 40.59 (95% CI 13.24–124.47), respectively). The associations of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis with *HLA‐B*27:05*, *HLA‐B*38:02* and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* remained significant when compared to population controls (OR being 7.37 (95% CI 3.86–14.07), 36.43 (95% CI 12.80–103.70) and 5.42 (95% CI 2.36–12.47), respectively). *HLA‐B*27:05*, *HLA‐B*38:02*, and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* alleles were associated with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis, especially in carbimazole/methimazole‐induced agranulocytosis.

### Conclusions

*HLA‐B*27:05*, *HLA‐B*38:02* and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* alleles were associated with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis, especially in carbimazole/methimazole‐induced agranulocytosis.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Antithyroid drugs (ATDs) have been widely used for the treatment of Graves' disease (GD), the leading cause of hyperthyroidism, for over 5 decades.[1](#bcp13989-bib-0001), [2](#bcp13989-bib-0002) Approximately 50% of GD patients treated with ATDs can achieve long‐term remission.[3](#bcp13989-bib-0003) ATDs are small molecules known as thionamides, with 3 members widely used, including propylthiouracil (PTU), carbimazole (CMZ), and its active metabolite methimazole (MMI).[2](#bcp13989-bib-0002) In clinical practice, CMZ and MMI are more commonly used than PTU because of longer biological half‐lives (3–5 hours *vs* 1–2 hours, respectively) and lower severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs).[4](#bcp13989-bib-0004), [5](#bcp13989-bib-0005)

ATD‐induced agranulocytosis (defined as an absolute granulocyte count <500 mm^3^ while taking ATD in the first 3 months of treatment) was reported to be a severe ADR in GD patients with a prevalence of 0.2–0.5% and mortality rate of approximately 21%.[6](#bcp13989-bib-0006), [7](#bcp13989-bib-0007), [8](#bcp13989-bib-0008), [9](#bcp13989-bib-0009) Agranulocytosis can increase the risk of infections and sepsis, and consequently becomes a life‐threatening event.[10](#bcp13989-bib-0010)

The pathogenic mechanism by which ATDs induce agranulocytosis is not well established but appears immune‐mediated.[8](#bcp13989-bib-0008) Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes, the most polymorphic gene cluster in the human genome, are known to be involved in immune‐mediated reactions. Specific polymorphism in HLA genotypes play a crucial role in various ADRs, including drug‐induced agranulocytosis. For example, clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis has been associated with genetic susceptibility by single amino acid changes in *HLA‐DQB1* (126Q) and *HLA‐B* (158T).[11](#bcp13989-bib-0011)

The associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis have been examined in different ethnic groups. In this study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the evidence on the associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis.

## 2. METHODS

### 2.1. Search strategy and selection criteria

We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of pharmacogenomics studies on the associations of HLA genotypes with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. The reporting of this study followed the Meta‐analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.[12](#bcp13989-bib-0012) We searched MEDLINE (1965 to 16 June 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1996 to 16 June 2018), and Embase (1947 to 16 June 2018) for relevant articles using keywords and synonyms for HLA, ATD and agranulocytosis. There were no language restrictions, but only human studies were included. Additional studies were retrieved from the reference lists of the included articles. Our search strategy is listed in the Supplementary Table [S1](#bcp13989-supitem-0001). For the study protocol see [http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018100570](http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018100570).

To be considered for inclusion in the meta‐analysis, the studies had to have: (i) investigated the associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis; (ii) included a case group composed of GD patients with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis and a control group composed of ATD‐tolerant GD patients or population controls; and (iii) reported sufficient data for calculating the frequency of risk HLA genotypes among cases and controls. The frequency of genotypes was examined by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium to determine whether patients from the selected studies were representative of the population.[13](#bcp13989-bib-0013), [14](#bcp13989-bib-0014) Two authors independently selected relevant studies by scanning the titles and abstracts of search results. The full text of potential studies was obtained and examined for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between authors until a consensus was reached.

### 2.2. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

We extracted the following data from the included studies: first author, year of publication, participant's ethnicity, study design, types of ATDs, diagnostic criteria, and risk estimates with odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the associations of HLA genotypes with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. Missing data were requested from study authors. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was employed in the risk of bias assessment of included studies.[15](#bcp13989-bib-0015) We evaluated the following 8 domains that may be associated with a biased risk estimate: adequacy of case definition, representativeness of cases, selection of controls, definition of controls, comparability of cases and controls, ascertainment of exposure, same method of ascertainment for cases and controls, and non‐response rate.[15](#bcp13989-bib-0015)

### 2.3. Data analysis and synthesis

In our primary analysis, we calculated a pooled OR with 95% CI for ATD‐induced agranulocytosis in relation to each HLA allele. Allele frequency data were converted into the number of patients with HLA genotypes present in at least 1 allele. The meta‐analyses were performed for studies that included matched ATD‐tolerant controls.

Since PTU‐induced agranulocytosis has been suggested to possess different genetic susceptibility from CMZ/MMI‐induced agranulocytosis by some researchers,[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018) we conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding PTU‐induced agranulocytosis. Also, we conducted an additional sensitivity analysis by including studies that had used population controls.[17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019)

Review Manager version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) was used in conducting meta‐analyses. The random‐effects model was chosen for meta‐analyses because clinical heterogeneity was anticipated. The *I* ^2^ statistic was calculated to examine statistical heterogeneity across the included studies. An *I* ^2^ of >50% was considered substantial heterogeneity.

## 3. RESULTS

### 3.1. Search strategy and selection criteria

The study selection process is shown in Figure [1](#bcp13989-fig-0001). The initial search of electronic databases identified 67 articles. After removing duplicates, 54 records were screened based on title, abstract or both to determined eligibility. We excluded 46 citations after scanning the titles and abstracts. After examination of the full text, 5 pharmacogenomics studies with a total of 7619 study subjects met our inclusion criteria and were included.[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019), [20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) No additional articles were identified after scanning the bibliographies of the included studies.

### 3.2. Characteristic of included studies

The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table [1](#bcp13989-tbl-0001). All the included studies were case–control studies.[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019), [20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) A total of 145 unique cases with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis, 1529 ATD‐tolerant controls and 5945 healthy controls were included in our systematic review and meta‐analysis. Most included studies were conducted in East Asia (3 in Han Chinese populations[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019) and 1 in a Japanese population[20](#bcp13989-bib-0020)), while only 1 study was conducted in Europe with mostly Swedish, Spanish, German and French populations.[17](#bcp13989-bib-0017) The diagnostic criteria for ATD‐induced agranulocytosis for each study are also summarized in Table [1](#bcp13989-tbl-0001), including definition of agranulocytosis and ATD‐tolerant controls, as well as assessment of drug causality between ATD and agranulocytosis. Three included studies conducted genome‐wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping for imputed HLA variants associated with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis,[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019) with 2 using direct HLA typing for validation.[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019) The study by He *et al*. performed HLA sequence‐based typing for 32 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in *HLA‐B* and *HLA‐DRB1* alleles,[18](#bcp13989-bib-0018) and the study by Tamai *et al*. used polymerase chain reaction sequence‐specific oligonucleotide primers to detect *HLA‐DRB1*, *DQA1*, *DQB1*, *DPA1*, and *DPB1* alleles.[20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) It is important to point out that the study by Tamai *et al*.[20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) had no coverage of risk alleles information on *HLA‐B* alleles. Five pharmacogenomics studies determined 3 risk HLA genotypes, including *HLA‐B*27:05*,[17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018) *HLA‐B*38:02* [16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019) and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* [16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) and assessed their associations with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis.

### 3.3. Risk of bias of included studies

The risk of bias of included studies is summarized in Figure [2](#bcp13989-fig-0002). Except for 1 study,[20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) the risk of bias for all the other 4 studies was rated low to moderate.[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019) As to the *case definition* domain, the study by Tamai and colleagues was rated high risk of bias because no causality assessment between ATD and agranulocytosis was done.[20](#bcp13989-bib-0020)

The Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale was used to access the risk of bias for five included studies. A green dot denotes low risk of bias; yellow, unclear risk of bias; red, high risk of bias

### 3.4. Associations of HLA genotypes with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis

The associations between HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis are summarized in Tables [2](#bcp13989-tbl-0002) and [3](#bcp13989-tbl-0003). In the primary analysis, 2 studies including 74 cases of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis and 319 matched ATD‐tolerant controls compared the carrier frequency to determine the association between *HLA‐B*27:05* and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis.[17](#bcp13989-bib-0017), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018) As shown in Figure [3](#bcp13989-fig-0003), the meta‐analysis demonstrated a nonsignificant trend for *HLA‐B*27:05* in cases of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis (pooled OR 10.97; 95% CI 0.75–159.99). Substantial statistical heterogeneity was found (I^2^ = 71%). The sensitivity analysis by excluding PTU showed that *HLA‐B*27:05* carriage was associated with a higher odds of CMZ/MMI‐induced agranulocytosis (OR 20.61; 95% CI 5.21–81.58; Table [3](#bcp13989-tbl-0003)). No statistical heterogeneity was found (I^2^ = 0%). One study of 39 cases of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis and 5170 population controls demonstrates increased odds of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis in carriers of the *HLA‐B*27:05* (OR 7.37; 95% CI 3.86–14.07).[17](#bcp13989-bib-0017)

Data were pooled separately by study design using random‐effects model; the inverse variance technique was used for pooling of measures of effects

The association between *HLA‐B*38:02* and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis is illustrated in Figure [4](#bcp13989-fig-0004). In the primary analysis, 3 studies with 113 cases of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis and 1541 matched ATD‐tolerant controls were pooled.[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019) Statistical heterogeneity was found across the included studies (I^2^ = 57%). The meta‐analysis showed patients with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis were significantly more likely to carry the *HLA‐B*38:02* allele compared with both matched controls (OR 19.85; 95% CI 7.94–49.57; *P* < .001). The sensitivity analysis excluding PTU showed CMZ/MMI‐inducing agranulocytosis had tremendously higher odds in patients carrying the allele of *HLA‐B*38:02* (OR 40.59; 95% CI 13.24–124.47; Table [3](#bcp13989-tbl-0003)).[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019) No substantial statistical heterogeneity was found (I^2^ = 45%). The sensitivity analysis by comparison to population controls included a total of 20 cases and 775 population controls and found significantly increased odds of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis in people with *HLA‐B*38:02 allele* (OR 36.43; 95% CI 12.80–103.70; *P* < .001).

Three studies with 135 cases of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis and 1596 matched ATD‐tolerant controls compared the carrier frequency to examine the association between *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis.[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016), [18](#bcp13989-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13989-bib-0019), [20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) We found no statistical heterogeneity across these studies (I^2^ = 0%). As demonstrated in Figure [5](#bcp13989-fig-0005), the primary analysis showed a significantly increased odds of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis in carriers of the *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* (pooled OR 5.29; 95% CI 3.44–8.14). In the sensitivity analysis excluding PTU (Table [3](#bcp13989-tbl-0003)), 4 studies revealed that carriers of the *HLA‐B* DRB1*08:03* had and increased odds of CMZ/MMI‐induced agranulocytosis (OR 5.95; 95% CI 3.77–9.39).[19](#bcp13989-bib-0019), [20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) No statistical heterogeneity was found (I^2^ = 0%). One study of 24 cases of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis and 525 population controls demonstrated increased odds of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis in carriers of the *HLA‐DRB1*08:03 allele* (OR 5.42; 95% CI 2.36–12.47).

## 4. DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first meta‐analysis of pharmacogenomics studies on the associations of HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. We found a high risk of developing ATD‐induced agranulocytosis among people carrying *HLA‐B*27:05*, *HLA‐B*38:02*, and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03 alleles*. Our meta‐analysis showed that people carrying *HLA‐B*27:05* had 10‐fold odds of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis (pooled OR 10.97; 95% CI 0.75–159.99). Those carrying *HLA‐B*38:02* and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03 alleles* had 20‐fold and 5‐fold odds of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis (pooled OR being 19.85 [95% CI 7.94–49.57] and 5.29 [95% CI 3.44–8.14], respectively). The associations between these HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis remained significant in sensitivity analyses excluding PTU and using population controls.

The pathogenesis of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis is an immune‐mediated reaction, elucidated by 2 postulated concepts. First, anti‐neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies targeting antigens on the surface of neutrophils have been identified, such as cathepsin G and proteinase.[8](#bcp13989-bib-0008), [25](#bcp13989-bib-0025), [26](#bcp13989-bib-0026) Second, oxidative drug metabolites induce T‐cell mediated reactions against proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.[8](#bcp13989-bib-0008), [27](#bcp13989-bib-0027) High levels of polymorphism and heterogeneity of HLA gene not only play a crucial role in immune regulation but also increase the chance of various ADRs,[28](#bcp13989-bib-0028), [29](#bcp13989-bib-0029) for example, *HLA‐B*15:02* and carbamazepine‐induced Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis,[30](#bcp13989-bib-0030) *HLA‐A*31:01* and carbamazepine‐induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms,[31](#bcp13989-bib-0031) *HLA‐B*13:01* and dapsone‐induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms,[32](#bcp13989-bib-0032) *HLA‐B*58:01* and allopurinol‐induced severe cutaneous adverse reaction,[33](#bcp13989-bib-0033) and *HLA‐B*57:01* and abacavir hypersensitivity.[34](#bcp13989-bib-0034) For drug‐induced agranulocytosis, genetic susceptibility with single amino acid changes in *HLA‐DQB1* (126Q) and *HLA‐B* (158 T) was associated with clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis.[11](#bcp13989-bib-0011) Therefore, the associations of *HLA‐DRB1* and *HLA‐B* with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis are biologically plausible. Docking simulation study in 3D structure modelling, suggesting stable MMI binding in the pockets of HLA‐B*38:02 and HLA‐DRB1*08:03 with alternating hydrogen bonds, predicted disulfide bond, and other specific contacts,[16](#bcp13989-bib-0016) also support this finding. However, the functions and detailed mechanisms of *HLA‐B*27:05*, *HLA‐B*38:02*, and *HLA‐B*38:02* need further experiments.

Although cross‐reactivity among ATD is common,[35](#bcp13989-bib-0035) PTU was used as alternative treatment for patients with CMZ/MMI‐induced agranulocytosis.[36](#bcp13989-bib-0036) Our sensitivity analysis excluding PTU showed the pooled ORs by risk of *HLA‐B*27:05* and *HLA‐B*38:02* were much increased in cases excluding PTU‐induced agranulocytosis, suggesting *HLA‐B*27:05* and *HLA‐B*38:02* may be more specific to CMZ/MMI‐induced agranulocytosis. The evidence also implies that the predisposing genetic factors for PTU‐induced agranulocytosis are different from those for CMZ/MMI‐induced agranulocytosis. However, there are few data on the HLA genotypes associated with PTU‐induced agranulocytosis.

The onset of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis may be abrupt, but patients are usually asymptomatic. More than half of patients are unaware of the common symptoms of agranulocytosis.[37](#bcp13989-bib-0037) Prevention is the best way for agranulocytosis, including patient education for symptoms of agranulocytosis at time of ATD prescription and monitoring of absolute neutrophil count at each visit.[6](#bcp13989-bib-0006), [7](#bcp13989-bib-0007) Pharmacogenomics‐guided treatment may be an alternative strategy to prevent ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. For clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis, HLA genotyping prior to clozapine initiation appeared cost‐effective for targeted blood monitoring only in patients with HLA susceptibility alleles.[38](#bcp13989-bib-0038) However, whether pharmacogenomics‐guided treatment is cost‐effective needs further investigations.

Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small with wide 95% CIs, suggesting limited precision of risk estimates that may be improved by addition of future studies. However, the direction of all associations in this study is consistent and unlikely to be altered by incorporation of future studies. Second, the present study focused on the relations between the HLA genotypes and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis. Other genes possibly associated with ATD‐induced agranulocytosis (such as *NOX3* gene) were excluded from our study.[39](#bcp13989-bib-0039) Third, the Japanese study[20](#bcp13989-bib-0020) did not report use of causality assessment to validate ATD as culprit drug in agranulocytosis and only examined certain *HLA alleles* (*HLA‐DRB1*, *DQA1*, *DQB1*, *DPA1*, and *DPB1* alleles). However, exclusion of the Japanese study would not change the conclusions of this study. Fourth, there was possible error in HLA imputation in Hallberg *et al*.'s study because no validation using direct HLA typing was performed.[17](#bcp13989-bib-0017) However, our conclusions would remain the same if we exclude the Hallberg *et al*.'s study. Fifth, most of the included studies were conducted in East Asian populations. Although the allele frequency of HLA varies in different geographic areas, the direction of associations between HLA alleles and ATD‐induced agranulocytosis were the same across different ethnic groups.

## 5. CONCLUSION

The best evidence from pharmacogenomics studies indicates strong associations of ATD‐induced agranulocytosis with *HLA‐B*27:05*, *HLA‐B*38:02* and *HLA‐DRB1*08:03* alleles. Our results may be considered by clinicians before prescribing ATDs.
