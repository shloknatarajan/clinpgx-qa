## Abstract

**Background and Aims:** 
There is wide inter-individual variability in response to the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) with the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone. To identify patients who may be most responsive to naltrexone treatment, studies have examined the moderating effect of rs1799971, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that encodes a non-synonymous substitution (Asn40Asp) in the mu-opioid receptor gene, OPRM1. The aims of this study were to: (1) conduct a systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs); (2) assess the bias of the available studies and gauge publication bias; and (3) meta-analyze the interaction effect of the Asn40Asp SNP on the response to naltrexone treatment.

**Methods:** 
We searched for placebo-controlled RCTs that examined the effect of Asn40Asp on the response to naltrexone treatment of heavy drinking or AUD. We tested the hypothesis that the minor (Asp40) allele was associated with a greater reduction in five alcohol consumption measures (relapse to heavy drinking, abstinence, percent heavy drinking days, percent days abstinent, and drinks per day) in naltrexone-treated participants by meta-analyzing the interaction effects using a random effects model.

**Results:** 
Seven RCTs met the study criteria. Overall, risk of bias was low and we observed no evidence of publication bias. Of the five alcohol consumption outcomes considered, there was a nominally significant moderating effect of the Asn40Asp SNP only on drinks per day (d = −0.18, p = 0.02). However, the effect was not significant when multiple comparisons were taken into account.

**Conclusions:** 
From the evidence to date, it remains unclear whether Rs1799971, the OPRM1 Asn40Asp single nucleotide polymorphism, predicts naltrexone treatment response in individuals with alcohol use disorder or heavy drinking.

## Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent [[1](#R1)], costly, and debilitating disorder with few efficacious pharmacological treatment options [[2](#R2)]. In 1984, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved naltrexone hydrochloride, an opioid receptor antagonist, for treating opioid addiction. In 1994, it was approved for treating AUD and is now a first-line treatment for that disorder.

Naltrexone’s mechanism of action in treating AUD is not fully understood. Because naltrexone’s greatest activity is at the mu-opioid receptor, its efficacy could be related to the fact that alcohol consumption increases endogenous opioid activity and the drug blunts alcohol-induced reward by decreasing dopamine release in the medial forebrain and nucleus accumbens [[3](#R3)–[5](#R5)]. This is manifested in humans as reduced intoxication, craving, and subjective high, effects that may reduce the risk of relapse to heavy drinking [[6](#R6)–[7](#R7)].

Data from animal models show that naltrexone reduces the reinforcing effects of alcohol and its consumption, without affecting signs of alcohol withdrawal or negative affect [[8](#R8)]. Large-scale, randomized controlled trials (RCTs; [[9](#R9)]) and meta-analyses [[6](#R6), [10](#R10), [11](#R11)] support the use of naltrexone for treating AUD. However, naltrexone’s overall therapeutic effect is small [[6](#R6), [10](#R10), [11](#R11)] and it varies in magnitude among individuals with AUD who are treated with it. Thus, precision medicine approaches, which aim to prescribe the optimal treatment for a specific patient, could enhance the effectiveness of naltrexone treatment by identifying individuals who are more likely to respond to treatment with the drug.

Various moderators of naltrexone’s effects on drinking, both environmental and genetic, have been proposed. One hypothesized moderator of naltrexone’s effects in AUD is rs1799971, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the μ-opioid receptor gene (*OPRM1*). The mu-opioid receptor plays a key role in pleasure and reward pathways regulated by the endogenous opioid system and may contribute to pain perception, stress reactivity, and risk of developing a substance use disorder [[12](#R12)]. The SNP is an A-to-G substitution (A118G) that results in a functional amino acid substitution [[13](#R13)], Asn40Asp. The mu-opioid receptor encoded by the Asp40 allele has been shown to bind ß-endorphin and activate G-protein coupled potassium ion channels more than the receptor encoded by the Asn40 allele [[13](#R13)], though subsequent studies have also shown loss-of-function effects of the Asp40 allele [[14](#R14)]. Initial secondary analyses of RCTs of naltrexone for AUD showed that up to 25% of Europeans and 50% of Asians [[15](#R15), [16](#R16)] who were carriers of the minor Asp40 allele had better responses to naltrexone treatment than Asn40-allele homozygotes [[17](#R17), [18](#R18)]. This evidence was supported by human laboratory studies in which Asp40-allele carriers treated with naltrexone reported less alcohol high and craving and greater alcohol-induced sedation and subjective intoxication than Asn40-allele homozygotes [[19](#R19)–[21](#R21)].

Subsequent studies, however, have yielded inconsistent results. An early meta-analysis of the available clinical studies showed a significant moderating effect of the Asn40Asp genotype [[22](#R22)], while a more recent one, which excluded from the primary analyses data from the first report of moderation [[17](#R17)], showed no such effect [[23](#R23)]. In contrast to both of these meta-analyses, studies in which were all retrospective, the present meta-analysis includes two RCTs [[24](#R24), [25](#R25)] that oversampled Asp-40 allele carriers and prospectively stratified participants on Asn40Asp genotype when randomizing them to naltrexone or placebo. Further, rather than focusing on naltrexone-treated patients, as in prior meta-analyses, we examined the interaction effects of medication (naltrexone or placebo) with the Asn40Asp SNP, a more stringent approach that is more appropriate for testing the hypothesis that the SNP moderates naltrexone treatment response.

We sought to more comprehensively assess the utility of the Asn40Asp SNP as a predictor of the response to naltrexone treatment of heavy drinking or AUD. The specific aims were to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available evidence from placebo-controlled RCTs that address this question. We also evaluated the presence of publication bias and bias associated with the included studies.

## Methods

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

RCTs were included if they: (1) enrolled participants age 18 years or older with problematic alcohol use (heavy drinking or AUD); (2) focused on alcohol consumption (i.e., rather than alcohol withdrawal or detoxification); (3) included quantitative measures of alcohol consumption; (4) compared naltrexone to placebo; and (5) investigated the interaction effect of the Asn40Asp SNP and medication group on alcohol consumption outcomes. We excluded human laboratory or experimental studies, neuroimaging studies, case reports, open-label trials, and review articles. We included studies irrespective of their size, duration, or setting; naltrexone dosage; or year or language of publication.

### Data Sources and Searches

Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [[26](#R26)], we searched PubMed (last search date February 12, 2019) and [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov) (last search date February 21, 2019) for relevant studies. [Supplementary Table S1](#SD1) shows the full search strategy. No filters were applied to the searches for date, language, country, or publication type. Search terms in PubMed included: “naltrexone and oprm1 and alcohol dependence and treatment” (58 articles). In [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov), “naltrexone” and “oprm1” were used as search terms with the following conditions: “alcohol dependence” (8 studies), “alcoholism” (8 studies), “alcohol-related disorders” (8 studies), “alcohol use disorder” (3 studies), and “heavy drinking” (0 studies). We also searched the reference sections of relevant articles manually for previously unidentified studies, which provided one additional study.

### Study Selection and Bias Assessment

Three authors (EH, HK, PM) independently screened potential studies based on titles and abstracts. Two authors (EH, HK) reviewed relevant articles to select those appropriate for inclusion and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool [[27](#R27)] to assess the following specific components of bias: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcomes assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Disagreements that arose on which articles to include and the presence of bias were resolved through discussion between the reviewers.

### Data Extraction/Acquisition

The outcomes of interest were: the percentage of individuals who relapsed to heavy drinking during the entire study period, percentage of individuals who were abstinent for the entire study, percentage of heavy drinking days (defined in each study, but consistently as 4 or more drinks/day), percentage of days abstinent, and mean drinks per day. We augmented the published data on these outcomes with data obtained from the study investigators. We obtained the number of subjects who experienced a relapse to heavy drinking and that abstained throughout the study and the total number of subjects who could have experienced these events by drug assignment and genotype (four groups). For the percentage of heavy drinking days, percentage of abstinent days during the study, and number of drinks per day, we obtained the mean and standard deviation by drug assignment and genotype. We received complete responses for all studies except one [[17](#R17)], for which the data were no longer available. Thus, for that study, we used only the published data for the percentage of participants who relapsed to heavy drinking and that abstained throughout the study.

### Effect Size Calculation and Data Analysis

The effect size estimate of interest was the interaction effect between treatment group (naltrexone/placebo) and Asn40Asp genotype on drinking outcomes. We used the odds ratio (OR) as the efficacy measure for binary outcomes (abstinence and relapse to heavy drinking), which was calculated using the sample sizes and the numbers of subjects who experienced the event of interest. We used logistic regression individually for each study to estimate the interaction effect. The ORs for an interaction represents the ratio of two ORs (ROR) and the interaction estimates the likelihood that Asp40-allele carriers compared to Asn40-allele homozygotes experienced the event of interest under naltrexone compared to placebo treatment. Because one study [[28](#R28)] had as an inclusion criterion a goal of reduced drinking, rather than abstinence, it was not included in the meta-analysis for that outcome measure.

We used Cohen’s d as the efficacy measure for continuous outcomes (percent days heavy drinking, percent days abstinent, and mean drinks per day). To calculate Cohen’s d, we first calculated a linear contrast for each study to test the interaction of drug by genotype using the descriptive statistics for the four groups (2 drugs X 2 genotypes) from the information provided by the studies’ authors. The contrast was divided by the square root of the mean square error [[29](#R29)] to yield a standardized difference: the difference of the difference in means [(Asp40_naltrexone_ – Asn40/Asn40_naltrexone_) – (Asp40_placebo_ – Asn40/Asn40_placebo_)]. This results in a difference in standardized mean differences (dSMD). Further, for each study, the statistical significance of the interaction contrast was tested by dividing the contrast of means by the standard error of the contrast.

We used a random effects model with studies weighted by the inverse of the squared standard error of the interaction term and the Dersimonian and Laird method [[30](#R30)] to estimate between-study variance. We also conducted a three-level meta-analysis of dependent effect sizes with inverse weighting of outcomes and random effects for study and outcome nested within study to estimate an overall multivariate effect size across all five drinking outcomes [[31](#R31)]. For the three-level model, we converted odds ratios to values of Cohen’s d [[32](#R32)] and made the direction of all effects positive to represent a favorable response to naltrexone treatment among Asp40-allele carriers. We used the false discovery rate (FDR) to control for Type I error given the multiple comparisons in this study. The Cochran Q statistic was used to test for heterogeneity among effect sizes and I^2^ provided a measure of the proportion of variance attributed to study heterogeneity. We used the Egger regression test [[33](#R33)] to assess small study effects. All analyses were conducted in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). Whereas the analysis was not pre-registered, the results should be considered exploratory.

## Results

The screening of abstracts yielded a total of 86 records; after duplicates were removed, 64 records remained. Screening the titles and abstracts of these records provided information that led to the exclusion of 55 articles, while full-text review of the remaining nine articles resulted in the exclusion of two that failed to meet study criteria, leaving a total of seven studies for inclusion in the meta-analyses. [Figure 1](#F1) provides details on the bases for exclusion.

Experimental/lab paradigm= studies not focused on the treatment of alcohol dependence or AUD (e.g. cue paradigm, neuroimaging, etc.) with brief medication administration periods.

The seven studies included a total of 659 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive naltrexone and 597 who received placebo. [Table 1](#T1) shows the characteristics of the studies and subjects included in the meta-analysis. Except for the Gelernter et al. [[34](#R34)] study, which included African Americans (26.4%), who have a minor (Asp40) allele frequency (MAF) of <0.02 [[35](#R35)], participants were predominantly European-American (MAF=0.14; [[35](#R35)]). Nearly one-third (29%) of the subjects were Asp40-allele carriers, a higher percentage than the general population of European ancestry because two of the studies [[24](#R24), [25](#R25)] oversampled individuals with the Asp40-allele. Six of the seven studies used a naltrexone dosage of 50 mg/day and the majority of trials (4/7) were of 12 weeks duration (range = 12–16 weeks). Most subjects were male (range = 58.4–100%) and of European ancestry (range = 73.6–100%). Overall, the risk of bias of the included studies was low ([Supplementary Table S2](#SD1)), as the studies employed robust methodologies and provided full outcome data. The primary source of potential bias was from studies that restricted participants to particular populations (e.g., men only, dual diagnosis). The results of the Egger regression test revealed no evidence of small study effects for any of the outcomes (p > 0.2 for all measures).

For relapse to heavy drinking ([Figure 2](#F2)), there was no heterogeneity of effect size (I^2^ = 0.0%, p = 0.97). The overall effect [OR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52–1.64, p = 0.78] showed no evidence of moderation by the Asn40Asp SNP on naltrexone’s efficacy.

Similarly, for complete abstinence ([Figure 3](#F3)), there was no study heterogeneity (I^2^ = 0.0%, p = 0.82) and the overall effect did not differ significantly from 1, providing no evidence of moderation (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.72–2.74, p = 0.33).

For drinks per day ([Figure 6](#F6)), study heterogeneity was not significant (I^2^ = 33.8%, p = 0.18). In five of the six studies the interaction term favored naltrexone treatment in Asp40-allele carriers and when combined the overall effect differed from zero (d = −0.18, 95% CI: −0.32- −0.03, p = 0.02). Of the drinking outcomes investigated, this was the largest interaction effect, and the only one that was nominally significant. The FDR, which is less conservative than a Bonferroni correction when the outcomes are correlated, yielded a p-value of 0.10. Consistent with the individual results, the three-level meta-analysis evaluating all five drinking outcome effects simultaneously yielded a non-significant interaction effect (d = 0.12, 95% CI: −0.05–0.29, p = 0.14).

## Discussion

Naltrexone, a first-line treatment for AUD, shows substantial inter-individual variation in its effects on drinking. Rs1799971, the SNP that encodes Asn40Asp, a potential genetic moderator of naltrexone, has received considerable attention, with one prior meta-analysis supporting a moderating effect of the SNP on naltrexone response [[22](#R22)], while a second meta-analysis showed that, despite a direction of effect that was consistent with moderation, there was no statistically significant evidence supporting the SNP’s effect [[23](#R23)]. We also found no significant evidence that rs1799971 genotype moderated naltrexone effects on drinking outcomes. The largest effect that we observed that favored predicted Asp40-allele carriers treated with naltrexone was on drinks per day, which did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. A multivariate analysis also failed to show a significant moderating effect. We found no evidence of substantial study heterogeneity, no evidence of small study effects, and low risk of bias.

This study’s findings may differ from previous meta-analyses because we excluded studies that were not RCTs; included two studies in which the randomization was stratified on Asn40Asp genotype, neither of which showed a moderating effect of Asp40; focused on the interaction effect of genotype by medication, a more appropriate test of moderation than that used in previous meta-analyses; and included more alcohol-related outcomes than prior meta-analyses, obtaining unpublished data for many of the studies included, which prior meta-analyses did not.

Although some studies have shown that the Asp40 allele contributes to the risk of developing AUD, potentially through its effects on alcohol sensitivity (e.g., [[36](#R36)]), other studies have shown no such effect on alcohol sensitivity in human laboratory studies or AUD risk in meta-analyses of association studies [[15](#R15), [37](#R37), [38](#R38)]. The largest meta-analysis of the effects of the Asn40Asp SNP on AUD risk to date showed that the Asp40 allele has a small protective effect on general substance dependence liability [[39](#R39)]. Because much of this research has been conducted in individuals of European ancestry, the effect of the SNP requires evaluation in other populations, particularly because the frequency of the Asp40 allele varies widely by population, and the impact on AUD risk may also differ [[40](#R40), [41](#R41)].

Variation in *OPRM1* has also been studied in relation to a variety of other traits. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) found rs1799971 to be the only significant variant for opioid use disorder [[42](#R42)]. There are better-powered GWAS of alcohol-related traits than this opioid use disorder GWAS, but none have identified this SNP as associated with AUD [[43](#R43)]. Several meta-analyses have shown that Asp40-allele carriers may experience greater levels of pain, require higher opioid dosing for analgesia, or have fewer opioid-related adverse effects than Asn40-allele homozygotes [[44](#R44)–[46](#R46)]. However, similar to the findings for AUD risk and naltrexone treatment response, this work has yielded mixed findings regarding the size and direction of effects, the readiness for clinical application, and the impact of population group differences (see [[47](#R47)] for a review).

Although pharmacogenetic moderators have been evaluated for a variety of medications used to treat AUD [[48](#R48)], addiction medicine lags behind other specialties in regard to precision medicine, where oncology and cardiology have begun to apply it to routine clinical care [[49](#R49)]. Efforts in addiction medicine have focused on single SNPs or a few combined genetic variants, which have small individual effects. An alternative approach, the use of polygenic risk scores (PRS), which capture the collective predictive power of multiple SNPs (e.g., [[50](#R50), [51](#R51)]), warrants evaluation as a contributor to the etiology of AUD and a moderator of treatment response. Based on the findings reported here, the Asn40Asp SNP does not appear to be a useful candidate variant for predicting treatment response for the traits we evaluated, though its contribution to the development of substance use disorders remains to be fully elucidated.

Further, precision medicine approaches to addiction treatment need not be limited to the use of genetic moderators. For example, a secondary analysis of a study comparing naltrexone and acamprosate for treating AUD showed that individuals motivated to drink for reward, versus relief, reduced their drinking more when treated with naltrexone [[52](#R52)]. This finding was recently replicated in an independent sample of patients from a placebo-controlled trial comparing targeted with daily naltrexone [[53](#R53)]. Although drinking motive as a moderator of naltrexone treatment outcome is not well understood, further investigation of its role and that of other phenotypic effects on outcome is warranted.

There are study limitations that should be considered. Multiple factors can influence the findings of meta-analysis, including treatment adherence, the quality of available studies, the number of subjects enrolled cumulatively in those studies, and heterogeneity of participants in the different studies. The inherent heterogeneity of AUD [[54](#R54)] was compounded in this meta-analysis by the use of different inclusion criteria (e.g., severity of alcohol use problems, presence of psychiatric comorbidity), treatment goals (reduced drinking vs. abstinence), and study procedures in the different studies. All but two of the included studies were *post ho*c analyses of subsamples for which genetic data were available, potentially introducing bias. Some studies, most notably the VA Cooperative Study [[34](#R34)], did not restrict study enrollment to a single population group, thus introducing genetic heterogeneity despite controlling for population group in the original analyses. Further, all of the studies relied on self-reported alcohol consumption, rather than objective biomarkers (e.g., %CDT or phosphatidylethanol, which are sensitive and specific for alcohol use [[55](#R55), [56](#R56)]), so the findings may be biased by poor recall or under-reporting. Future studies should include biological measures to validate self-reported drinking behavior. Inadequate medication adherence, which reduces naltrexone’s effectiveness [[57](#R57)], may also have obscured a moderating effect of the Asn40Asp SNP. Studies that did not show a main effect of naltrexone over placebo could have limited value in assessing a pharmacogenetic interaction due to the potential for Type 2 error. [Supplementary Table S3](#SD1) presents alcohol-related outcomes and the associated p-values for the seven studies included in the meta-analysis, four of which showed at least one significant main effect of naltrexone. Insufficient statistical modeling of confounders may have also contributed to our null findings, as covariates were used inconsistently in the included studies, none of which utilized a covariate-by-environment and covariate-by-gene approach [[58](#R58)]. Finally, even though this is the largest meta-analysis to date that rigourously chose studies for inclusion, it is underpowered.

To our knowledge, there are no pharmacogenetic studies of extended-release naltrexone for treating AUD, which would enhance dose consistency and treatment adherence. Moreover, it is not known whether there is a dose effect, such that naltrexone is more effective at higher or lower doses in Asp40-allele carriers. We also did not consider other potential moderators of naltrexone efficacy, such as smoking [[25](#R25), [59](#R59)], sex, family history of AUD, or interactions between variation in *OPRM1* and other genes such as those associated with dopamine signaling [[60](#R60)]. It should also be noted that several studies we evaluated found that the Asp40 allele predicted treatment response over time [[18](#R18)] or at the end of the study [[25](#R25)], which suggests that time may be required for the moderating effect to emerge, which would have biological implications.

Strengths of the study are the inclusion of data from all available placebo-controlled RCTs, the overall low risk of bias, and a greater number of alcohol consumption measures than in previous meta-analyses, with the additional data provided by investigators augmenting the published findings. Further, rather than limiting the analysis to the effects of the SNP on the response to naltrexone, we analyzed the interaction effect of medication with Asn40Asp to address the key question of whether genotype effects in naltrexone-treated individuals are a pharmacogenetic effect. Finally, this is the first meta-analysis of the moderating effect of the Asn40Asp SNP on naltrexone response that included studies in which treatment allocation was prospectively based on genotype [[24](#R24), [25](#R25)].

In summary, we found no evidence for a pharmacogenetic effect of rs1799971 (encoding Asn40Asp) on naltrexone treatment response in AUD. Despite findings across all five outcomes that naltrexone treatment outcomes are marginally better in Asp40-allele carriers, these effects are not clinically relevant for identifying AUD patients who are most likely to respond to naltrexone treatment. Other potential approaches to personalizing naltrexone treatment of heavy drinking or AUD that warrant consideration include combining the Asn40Asp genotype with other genetic variants (e.g., [[60](#R60)]), using PRS to inform treatment decisions, or differentiating patients based on phenotype (e.g., [[52](#R52), [53](#R53)]).
