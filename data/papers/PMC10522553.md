## Abstract

**Introduction:** 
Chronic tricyclic antidepressant toxicity is rarely described in children. Symptoms include confusion, ataxia, and seizures. Toxicity may result from dosing error, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genetic variability, and drug-drug interactions. Chronic doxepin toxicity has not been previously reported in children. Doxepin is prescribed for insomnia and depression, with a maximum off-label dose of 3 mg/kg in children. We present a case of chronic doxepin toxicity mimicking epilepsy in a child attributable to three potential factors: supratherapeutic dosing, pharmacogenomic variability, and drug-drug interactions.

**Case Report:** 
A 10-year-old boy with insomnia, diagnosed with epilepsy 6 months prior, presented to an emergency department with confusion, ataxia, and increasing seizure frequency. He was prescribed doxepin for insomnia and four antiepileptics for seizures. After admission, he had two seizures and remained confused. EKGs showed QRS prolongation, suggesting doxepin toxicity. Doxepin-nordoxepin combined serum concentration was 1419 ng/mL (therapeutic 100–300 ng/mL), confirming doxepin toxicity. Outpatient records showed onset of confusion and seizures as doxepin dose was gradually uptitrated to 300 mg nightly (4.41 mg/kg). Symptoms worsened following addition of clobazam (CYP2D6 inhibitor) and topiramate (CYP2C19 inhibitor). Following doxepin discontinuation, all symptoms resolved. CYP2D6 testing showed intermediate metabolizer phenotype (CYP2D6*1/*4; activity score = 1.0; copy number = 2.0). No seizures have occurred in more than one year since doxepin discontinuation.

**Discussion:** 
Caution must be exercised when prescribing doxepin. Pharmacogenomics, dose, drug-drug interactions, and age should be considered. Chronic toxicity should be contemplated in patients taking doxepin without acute overdose who present with persistent neurologic abnormalities including seizure.

### Introduction

Chronic tricyclic antidepressant toxicity is rarely described in children. Symptoms include confusion, ataxia, and seizures. Toxicity may result from dosing error, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genetic variability, and drug-drug interactions. Chronic doxepin toxicity has not been previously reported in children. Doxepin is prescribed for insomnia and depression, with a maximum off-label dose of 3 mg/kg in children. We present a case of chronic doxepin toxicity mimicking epilepsy in a child attributable to three potential factors: supratherapeutic dosing, pharmacogenomic variability, and drug-drug interactions.

### Case Report

A 10-year-old boy with insomnia, diagnosed with epilepsy 6 months prior, presented to an emergency department with confusion, ataxia, and increasing seizure frequency. He was prescribed doxepin for insomnia and four antiepileptics for seizures. After admission, he had two seizures and remained confused. EKGs showed QRS prolongation, suggesting doxepin toxicity. Doxepin-nordoxepin combined serum concentration was 1419 ng/mL (therapeutic 100–300 ng/mL), confirming doxepin toxicity. Outpatient records showed onset of confusion and seizures as doxepin dose was gradually uptitrated to 300 mg nightly (4.41 mg/kg). Symptoms worsened following addition of clobazam (CYP2D6 inhibitor) and topiramate (CYP2C19 inhibitor). Following doxepin discontinuation, all symptoms resolved. CYP2D6 testing showed intermediate metabolizer phenotype (CYP2D6*1/*4; activity score = 1.0; copy number = 2.0). No seizures have occurred in more than one year since doxepin discontinuation.

### Discussion

Caution must be exercised when prescribing doxepin. Pharmacogenomics, dose, drug-drug interactions, and age should be considered. Chronic toxicity should be contemplated in patients taking doxepin without acute overdose who present with persistent neurologic abnormalities including seizure.

## Introduction

Acute overdose of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) such as doxepin may cause an antimuscarinic toxidrome, seizure, QRS and QTc prolongation, arrhythmia, and shock [[1](#CR1)]. Chronic TCA toxicity, particularly in children, is a rarely described entity usually developing over weeks to months. Its protean manifestations, including mood change, drowsiness, confusion, delirium, ataxia, and seizure, may be incorrectly attributed to an alternative etiology [[2](#CR2), [3](#CR3)]. To our knowledge, chronic doxepin toxicity in children has not been previously reported. Chronic toxicity may develop for multiple reasons. There is interindividual variation in doxepin metabolism due to genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which may result in toxicity despite therapeutic dosing [[4](#CR4), [5](#CR5)]. Supratherapeutic dosing error and CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 inhibition by other drugs may also cause toxicity [[6](#CR6), [7](#CR7)]. Finally, age- and disease-related differences in volume of distribution and hepatic, cardiac, and neurologic function may increase risk [[8](#CR8)]. Severe toxicity and death from doxepin are associated with serum concentrations exceeding 800 ng/mL, though toxicity may occur at lower concentrations [[9](#CR9)].

Doxepin is a tertiary amine TCA approved for treatment of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in adults. Doxepin is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any indication in children; however, an off-label maximum dose of 3 mg/kg/day for depression and anxiety has been proposed [[10](#CR10)–[12](#CR12)]. We describe a child with a 6-month history of perceived progressively worsening epilepsy who was ultimately found to have chronic doxepin toxicity. Three different mechanisms may have contributed to toxicity: off-label supratherapeutic dosing, pharmacogenomic variability in CYP2D6 drug metabolism, and drug-drug interactions. Doxepin discontinuation resulted in resolution of seizures.

## Case Report

A 10-year-old boy weighing 68 kg with a history of insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and epilepsy presented to an academic children’s hospital emergency department (ED) with confusion, ataxia, falls, and at least four generalized tonic–clonic seizures over the preceding 10 days, as well as 1 month of nocturnal enuresis. The patient’s home medications included doxepin, 300 mg nightly; clobazam, 10 mg twice daily; topiramate, 150 mg twice daily; levetiracetam, 1000 mg twice daily; valproic acid, 500 mg daily; and guanfacine, 3 mg daily. There was no history of overdose. Upon ED arrival, he had a temperature of 36.1 °C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute (BPM), blood pressure of 122/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient’s pupils were 3 mm bilaterally and reactive, and he was awake but confused with fluctuating arousal, slow speech, and an unsteady gait. No hyperreflexia or clonus was noted. EKG showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 79 BPM, QRS duration of 124 milliseconds (ms), and QT interval of 414 ms. Urine toxicology screening was positive for benzodiazepines, reflecting recent diazepam administration for seizure. Serum clobazam, topiramate, levetiracetam, and valproic acid concentrations were in therapeutic range, and ammonia concentration was normal. The patient was admitted to the neurology service for worsening of presumed epilepsy and encephalopathy. On admission, doxepin, topiramate, and clobazam were held. Levetiracetam, valproic acid, and guanfacine were continued.

On hospital day 2, he experienced two generalized tonic–clonic seizures confirmed by EEG. Brain MRI showed no epileptogenic lesion. On hospital day 4, the medical toxicology service was consulted for concern for doxepin withdrawal contributing to persistent confusion. Toxicologists’ review of EKGs, however, which showed increased QRS duration and aVR R-wave amplitude, raised concern for doxepin toxicity (Fig. [1](#Fig1)).

Hospital day 2 EKG with QRS 144 ms and aVR R-wave 11 mm.

Sodium bicarbonate 2 mEq/kg IV bolus resulted in QRS narrowing from 114 to 108 ms and decrease in aVR R-wave amplitude from 8 to 5 mm. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with a plan to initiate sodium bicarbonate infusion if QRS duration increased beyond 120 ms. QRS remained stable at less than 120 ms, no seizure or arrhythmia occurred, and he was transferred back to the neurology service on hospital day 5. Confusion and ataxia gradually improved during hospitalization, and no further seizures occurred. On hospital day 9, referred-out doxepin and nordoxepin serum concentrations from multiple time points during hospitalization returned abnormally elevated, confirming chronic doxepin toxicity (Fig. [2](#Fig2)). The highest combined doxepin-nordoxepin concentration, obtained on hospital day one at 29 hours after last doxepin dose, was 1419 ng/mL (therapeutic range commonly reported as 100–300 ng/mL) [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)].

Doxepin and nordoxepin serum concentrations over time.

Review of outpatient records revealed greater than 7 months of worsening confusion and 6 months of increasing seizure frequency correlating temporally with gradual increases in doxepin dose, which was prescribed off-label for insomnia by the patient’s psychiatrist (Fig. [3](#Fig3)). Impaired cognition was noted at school after dose increase from 75 (1.10 mg/kg) to 150 mg nightly (2.21 mg/kg), and first seizure occurred 2 weeks after dose increase from 150 to 200 mg nightly (2.94 mg/kg). Following initiation of topiramate 200 mg twice daily for seizures refractory to levetiracetam and valproic acid, the patient developed ataxia with resultant falls, and minute-long unresponsive staring episodes occurring 6–8 times daily with associated amnesia. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, doxepin dose was increased to 300 mg nightly (4.41 mg/kg); over the following 7 days, two seizures occurred, and EEG was newly suggestive of generalized epilepsy. After addition of clobazam 10 mg twice daily as a fourth antiepileptic 6 days prior to hospitalization, he became unremittingly confused, increasingly ataxic with multiple falls, and had two seizures.

Clinical course

On hospital day 10, the patient’s mentation and gait were near baseline, and he was discharged with instructions to discontinue doxepin, clobazam, and topiramate. Levetiracetam and valproic acid were continued at discharge with a plan for eventual discontinuation. Discharge EKG showed right axis deviation, QRS of 106 ms, and aVR R-wave of 5 mm. Outpatient EKG 5 days later showed normal axis, QRS of 96 ms, and aVR R-wave of 3 mm. Three weeks after discharge, referred out pharmacogenomic testing with RPRD Diagnostics Whole Pharmacogenomics Scan demonstrated normal CYP2C19 function (CYP2C19*1/*1; 27 alleles tested for) and CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer phenotype (genotype CYP2D6*1/*4; activity score = 1.0; copy number = 2.0; 67 alleles tested for) [[15](#CR15)]. EEG 4 months after discharge showed resolution of previously noted encephalopathy and epileptiform discharges. He has not had a seizure in more than 1 year since doxepin discontinuation. Consent for publication of this case was obtained and provided to the journal in accordance with JMT policy.

## Discussion

We report a case of chronic doxepin toxicity in a 10-year-old boy mimicking epilepsy for 6 months and causing neurotoxicity for more than 7 months. Multiple mechanisms for chronic TCA toxicity are reported; however, to our knowledge, this case is unique in describing three potential contributing etiologies: supratherapeutic off-label dosing, decreased CYP2D6 function due to patient genotype, and clobazam and topiramate drug-drug interactions causing CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 inhibition, respectively. The misdiagnosis of epilepsy, resultant antiepileptic treatment which may have exacerbated doxepin toxicity, and prolonged duration of symptoms distinguish this case as well. Finally, this report adds to the sparse literature of chronic TCA toxicity in children and is the first description of chronic doxepin toxicity in a child that we are aware of [[2](#CR2), [7](#CR7)].

Doxepin is not FDA-approved for use in children due to a scarcity of data, with the package insert stating “The use of doxepin in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established” [[11](#CR11)]. For off-label treatment of depression and anxiety, daily maximums of 3 mg/kg for those under 12 years of age and 300 mg for those over 12 have been proposed; however, our patient was prescribed doxepin off-label for insomnia [[12](#CR12)]. Insomnia in children, particularly when comorbid with psychiatric diagnoses such as ADHD, is difficult to treat due to a lack of FDA-approved medications [[16](#CR16)]. Doxepin is the most antihistaminergic TCA, with an H1 histamine receptor inhibition constant (*K*_i_) of 0.24 nmol/L, and may be an effective sleep aid [[17](#CR17)]. As dose exceeds 10 mg nightly, and particularly once 75 mg is exceeded, selectivity for the H1 histamine receptor is lost and antimuscarinic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic effects occur in addition to sedation [[16](#CR16)]. Because of this, the maximum on-label adult insomnia dose is 6 mg nightly; one study in children used a maximum of 10 mg nightly without notable adverse effects [[10](#CR10), [16](#CR16)].

In our case, impaired cognition was first observed when nightly dosing exceeded 75 mg, and additional symptoms occurred with further dose increases. Pharmacokinetics may differ in obese children due to altered volume of distribution, metabolism, and elimination, resulting in a lack of clarity regarding best dosing practices [[18](#CR18)]. More liberal dosing for lipophilic medications such as doxepin (octanol–water partition coefficient at physiologic pH, or Log D, 2.93) uses total body weight for weight-based dosing instead of alternatives such as lean body weight [[19](#CR19), [20](#CR20)]. Our patient weighed 68 kg and had a body mass index of 30.63 kg/m^2^, which is in the 99th percentile by age. Therefore, the maximum daily weight-based antidepressant dose of 3 mg/kg/day using total body weight would be 204 mg, yet this was exceeded (300 mg, or 4.41 mg/kg, nightly). Even among adolescents and adults, who can receive a daily maximum of 300 mg, doses of more than 150 mg should be divided twice daily [[11](#CR11)]. Thus, this patient’s 300 mg nightly dose was double the recommended maximum for a single time point in any age group. Following dose increase to 300 mg nightly, two witnessed seizures and multiple suspected seizures occurred predominantly overnight and in the morning. The timing of these events may be related to peak doxepin and nordoxepin concentrations shortly after his nightly dose.

In our case, seizures developed 2 weeks after dose increase to 200 mg nightly (2.94 mg/kg). The development of seizures just below the off-label maximum may reflect a relative lack of evidence supporting purportedly safe dosing guidelines, as well as differences in the toxicodynamics of chronic versus acute toxicity [[12](#CR12)]. Another explanation, however, involves the patient’s CYP2D6 genotype. Metabolism of doxepin, which is more serotonergic, occurs primarily via CYP2C19 demethylation to nordoxepin, which exerts more noradrenergic effects [[4](#CR4)]. Nordoxepin is then hydroxylated by CYP2D6 to 2-hydroxynordoxepin. To a lesser extent, doxepin is also directly hydroxylated by CYP2D6 to 2-hydroxydoxepin. Hydroxylated metabolites, which are less pharmacologically active, are then conjugated and excreted [[9](#CR9)]. This patient’s pharmacogenomic testing showed normal CYP2C19 genotype (CYP2C19*1/*1) but CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer phenotype due to one normal function allele and one no-function allele (CYP2D6*1/*4; activity score = 1.0; copy number = 2.0) [[21](#CR21)]. Serum doxepin:nordoxepin ratio is typically 1:1 with therapeutic dosing; however, here, initial doxepin:nordoxepin ratio measured in hospital 29 h after last doxepin dose was 0.39:1 [[14](#CR14)]. Extrapolated doxepin:nordoxepin ratio 3.5 h after last dose, when peak serum drug concentration would be expected with therapeutic dosing, was 0.51:1. This may reflect decreased CYP2D6 enzymatic activity with or without altered pharmacokinetics of overdose. Increased norepinephrine reuptake inhibition in TCA poisoning is one proposed mechanism for seizure, potentially placing our patient at increased seizure risk due to heightened noradrenergic effects from disproportionately elevated nordoxepin concentrations [[20](#CR20)].

Our patient’s CYP2D6 functional deficiency, with one no-function allele, was relatively mild [[21](#CR21)]. For example, up to 23% of patients may carry either two CYP2D6 no-function alleles or one decreased function and one no-function allele [[4](#CR4)]. A minority of patients will achieve therapeutic serum doxepin concentrations with usual dosing, with the rest either supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic due to underlying genotype [[6](#CR6), [14](#CR14)]. With this in mind, some clinicians have advocated for routine pharmacogenomic testing prior to medication initiation and therapeutic drug monitoring soon after, with medication avoidance or dose alteration as needed [[3](#CR3)–[5](#CR5)].

In this case, CYP2D6 function was likely further impaired by clobazam, a moderate inhibitor which decreases CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism by 50–80% [[22](#CR22)]. Within days of clobazam initiation, the patient experienced worsening ataxia and falls, increasing confusion, and a total of four seizures (including two shortly after a therapeutic clobazam concentration was measured in hospital). This interaction is reflected in doxepin’s package insert, which recommends therapeutic drug monitoring if co-administered with known CYP2D6 inhibitors [[11](#CR11)]. The introduction of topiramate, a CYP2C19 inhibitor of unknown severity, was possibly counterproductive [[23](#CR23)]. Within 1 week of initiation, the patient developed abrupt-onset unresponsive staring spells. Whether these represented worsening neurotoxicity or seizures from impaired doxepin metabolism is unknown, as EEG was not performed during the episodes. Alternatively, the staring spells may have represented topiramate-induced somnolence, a known medication side effect.

The half-lives of doxepin and nordoxepin are normally reported as 15 and 31 h, respectively [[10](#CR10)]. In this case, doxepin and nordoxepin half-lives were prolonged at 66 h and 165 h, respectively, which may be attributable to multiple factors including excessive dose, pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interactions, and increased volume of distribution due to the patient’s obesity [[24](#CR24)]. However, elimination kinetics remained first order, with semi-logarithmic (ln) conversion of drug concentrations plotted against time with linear regression (Excel 2022, Microsoft, Redmond WA) showing first-order elimination for doxepin (*r*^2^ = 0.99) and nordoxepin (*r*^2^ = 0.98).

This case is notable for the absence of certain findings common in TCA toxicity. Despite developing seizures worsening in frequency over 6 months, the patient did not experience arrhythmia during hospitalization when doxepin serum concentration may have peaked, nor did he presumably experience dysrhythmia prior to hospitalization, as his neurologic symptoms were less severe, and no palpitations or syncope were reported. Preskorn and Fast noted average serum TCA concentrations causing seizure and arrhythmia in chronic toxicity to be 734 ng/mL and approximately 1300 ng/mL, respectively [[6](#CR6)]. While these numbers are not specific to doxepin, they do suggest a discordance between neurotoxic and cardiotoxic concentrations. This patient was also neither tachycardic nor mydriatic at ED presentation notwithstanding doxepin’s antimuscarinic properties; however, daily guanfacine may have been a confounder [[17](#CR17)]. Finally, he experienced enuresis without urinary retention; however, this was also described in a pediatric case of chronic amitriptyline toxicity [[7](#CR7)]. Development of tolerance to adverse effects with chronic dosing may also explain this lack of typical side effects, including the lack of cardiovascular abnormalities other than previously discussed EKG changes [[25](#CR25)].

This report has multiple limitations. It is a single-patient case report, and the conclusions drawn and generalizability are therefore limited. In particular, another limiting factor is this boy’s morbid obesity. Though serum doxepin and nordoxepin concentrations were obtained during the patient’s hospitalization, concentrations were not obtained before and after initiation of topiramate and clobazam. Thus, though initiation of these antiepileptics does temporally correlate with worsening symptoms, the degree to which their inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 contributed to increases in serum doxepin and nordoxepin concentrations and toxicity cannot be precisely determined. Likewise, serum doxepin and nordoxepin concentrations obtained at other critical time points outside of the hospitalization period (e.g., at first onset of confusion and seizure) would have provided insight into his dose-concentration relationship and threshold concentrations for manifesting neurotoxic symptoms.

## Conclusion

Caution must be exercised when prescribing doxepin. Pharmacogenomic testing before initiation and therapeutic drug monitoring may decrease risk of toxicity. Dose, potential drug-drug interactions, comorbidities, and age should be thoroughly considered. Risks of off-label prescribing in children should be carefully considered. In patients taking doxepin who present with neurologic abnormalities including seizure but no acute overdose history, evaluation for chronic doxepin toxicity is indicated. Finally, chronic doxepin poisoning may manifest as prolonged neurotoxicity including seizure in the absence of dysrhythmia or shock.
