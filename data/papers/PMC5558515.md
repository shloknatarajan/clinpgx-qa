## Abstract

**Aims:** 
Validation of associations for SNPs in RAC2, NCF4 and SLC28A3, identification of a novel association with a TOP2B SNP and screening 23 SNPs putatively relevant to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

**Patients & methods:** 
A total of 166 breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin underwent echocardiogram, including 19 cases with systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <55%) and 147 controls. Four high priority SNPs were tested in the primary analysis, with appropriate statistical correction, and 23 additional SNPs were screened in an uncorrected secondary analysis.

**Results:** 
Previously reported associations for RAC2, NCF4 and SLC28A3 could not be validated and a novel association with TOP2B was not discovered in this cohort (all p > 0.05), likely due to inadequate power. Two SNPs were identified in the uncorrected secondary analysis including a protective SNP in ABCB1 (3435C>T, p = 0.049) and a risk allele in CBR3 (V244M, p = 0.012).

**Conclusion:** 
The associations reported in prior publications and those discovered in this secondary analysis require further replication in independent cohorts.

### Aims:

Validation of associations for SNPs in *RAC2, NCF4* and *SLC28A3*, identification of a novel association with a *TOP2B* SNP and screening 23 SNPs putatively relevant to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

### Patients & methods:

A total of 166 breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin underwent echocardiogram, including 19 cases with systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <55%) and 147 controls. Four high priority SNPs were tested in the primary analysis, with appropriate statistical correction, and 23 additional SNPs were screened in an uncorrected secondary analysis.

### Results:

Previously reported associations for *RAC2, NCF4* and *SLC28A3* could not be validated and a novel association with *TOP2B* was not discovered in this cohort (all p > 0.05), likely due to inadequate power. Two SNPs were identified in the uncorrected secondary analysis including a protective SNP in *ABCB1* (3435C>T, p = 0.049) and a risk allele in *CBR3* (V244M, p = 0.012).

### Conclusion:

The associations reported in prior publications and those discovered in this secondary analysis require further replication in independent cohorts.

## Patients & methods

### Cohort

We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy in a cohort of women recruited from the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Detailed information regarding the parent clinical study cohort, procedures and findings can be found in the primary publication [[14](#B14)]. Briefly, patients seen in the Breast Oncology Program who had completed neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with a doxorubicin-based regimen for stage I–III breast cancer and received their last dose of doxorubicin at least 12 months prior were eligible for enrollment. No patients in this study had congestive heart failure (CHF) prior to doxorubicin treatment as this is a strict contraindication. Patients with a previous or second cancer that required chemotherapy or radiation to the chest, had a breast cancer recurrence or metastatic disease, or were receiving trastuzumab at the time of enrollment were ineligible. Patients with known anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction were eligible for this study, but this was not used to identify potential subjects, as one of the objectives of the parent study was to document the prevalence of chronic cardiomyopathy in an unselected cohort of doxorubicin treated patients. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan Medical School (MI, USA).

After informed consent was obtained, individuals underwent a physical exam, blood draw, urine collection and cardiovascular health questionnaire. Blood and urine samples were analyzed for highly sensitive physiological biomarkers of heart strain including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin and NT-proBNP [[15](#B15),[16](#B16)]. Individuals with known doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy or an abnormal biomarker, physical exam, or symptom inventory suggestive of cardiac dysfunction were referred for an echocardiogram and eligible for this secondary pharmacogenetic analysis. An extensive medical record review was conducted for evaluation of relevant patient, disease and treatment characteristics such as age, comorbid conditions, breast cancer stage and treatment received. Continuous quality checks of the data were performed. All clinical data were collected prior to genetic analysis.

### Genotyping

Whole blood was collected and stored at -80°C until DNA extraction using the QIAamp^®^ DNA blood kit (Qiagen Inc., CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA quality and quantity was determined using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer^™^ (Thermo Scientific, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) and 300 ng submitted to the University of Michigan Medical School's DNA Sequencing Core for genotype determination using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX^®^ platform (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). SNP assays were designed using the Sequenom software (both online Assay Design Suite tools and desktop Assay Design 4.0) and assays were performed using a Sequenom MassARRAY Compact instrument, according to manufacturer's standard protocols. Results were processed to generate SNP calls automatically, using Sequenom TyperAnalyzer software, and then manually reviewed by the operator to validate the allele calls. Automatic SNP calls that were of concern, based on questionable spectra, were removed. A total of 16 unique SNPs were determined using Sequenom MassARRAY and an additional eight SNPs of interest (*ABCB1*: rs1128503, *RAC2*: rs13058338, *NCF4*: rs1883112, *TOP2B*: rs10865801, *CYP3A4**22: rs35599367, *ABCB4*: rs1149222, *CBR3*: rs1056892, *CYBA*: rs4673) were determined using the Applied Biosystems’ (CA, USA) Taqman^®^ Allelic Discrimination Assay as previously described [[17](#B17)].

### Statistical analyses

Genotyping quality control was conducted for the 24 SNPs selected for analysis including call rate (>95%), Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.002 [0.05/24]), and regenotyping of 10% of samples genotyped by Taqman™ Allelic Discrimination Assay (Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). Individuals were dichotomized into cases and controls for pharmacogenetic association testing with the primary endpoint, systolic dysfunction defined as an EF <55%, patients with EF ≥55% were classified as controls. The threshold EF of 55% was chosen based on the American Society of Echocardiographer's Guidelines [[18](#B18)]. Demographics were compared between cases and controls using Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for age, BMI and cumulative anthracycline dose.

From the 24 SNPs included in the analysis, four were selected *a priori* as co-primary hypotheses based on previous successful replication (*RAC2* rs13058338, *NCF4* rs1883112, *SLC28A3* rs7853758) [[8–12](#B8)] and biological rationale (*TOP2B* rs10865801) [[13](#B13)]. For each co-primary hypothesis a predicted genetic model and direction of effect was selected based on prior literature. An analysis that has a predefined direction of effect is analyzed using a one-sided p-value. The typical threshold for a one-sided p-value is p = 0.10, which is equivalent to the familiar p = 0.05 for a two-tailed test (which can be significant in either direction). In this analysis we performed four one-sided association tests using an appropriately corrected significance threshold of α = 0.025 (0.10/4). A secondary, uncorrected screen was performed including all SNPs to test for an association with EF <55% assuming an additive genetic model without defining a direction of effect. No statistical correction was applied to this hypothesis-generating exploratory analysis. SNP association analyses were conducted using univariate logistic regression, followed by multivariable regression for any positive associations adjusting for relevant clinical covariates (age at enrollment, hypertension, trastuzumab treatment, cumulative anthracycline dose and left sided radiation) [[19](#B19)]. All analyses were performed using SAS^®^ v9.3 (SAS, NC, USA) and R 3.0.2 (genetics package).

## Results

Among the 293 subjects enrolled into the parent clinical study [[14](#B14)], 166 underwent echocardiogram due to known anthracycline-induced CHF or an abnormal biomarker suggestive of CHF. Of these 166 echocardiograms, 19 cases of systolic dysfunction (EF <55%) were identified for comparison with the control group of 147 patients who had a normal echocardiogram ([Figure 1](#F0001)). Demographic data for the entire cohort, the controls and the cases (stratified by EF <55%) are reported in [Table 1](#T1). The patient population was predominantly non-Hispanic white (95%) with a median age of 50 years at the time of anthracycline treatment and 56 years at the time of study enrollment. More than 80% of individuals received radiation, with approximately half of that directed at the left side of the chest, and less than 20% of patients received trastuzumab. No patients were given trastuzumab concurrently with doxorubicin and no patients were being treated with trastuzumab at the time of study enrollment. No significant differences in demographic, treatment, or clinical factors were identified between the cases and controls (p > 0.05).

Among the 293 patients enrolled on the clinical study, 166 underwent an echocardiogram, 19 of which were documented to have EF <55% (cases). Patients with normal echocardiograms (EF ≥55%; n = 147) were included as controls. CHF: Congestive heart failure; EF: Ejection fraction determined by transthoracic echocardiogram.

One candidate SNP determined by Sequenom failed quality assurance (*CYP3A4*1B*, rs12705060) and was excluded leaving 23 SNPs for analysis. None of the four co-primary hypotheses were significantly associated with EF <55% with the selected genetic model and direction of effect (p > 0.025, [Table 2](#T2)). The full results for each SNP including the genotype frequency in the cases and controls and the association results for different genetic models (additive, recessive and dominant) are shown in [Supplementary Table 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs.15.162/suppl_file/pgs-17-231-s1.docx). The choice of genetic model did not meaningfully change the results, nor did adjustment for clinical covariates or restricting analysis to white patients only (n = 157) (p > 0.025, data not shown).

All 23 candidate SNPs were then tested for an association with EF <55% in a secondary pharmacogenetic screening analysis assuming an additive genetic effect using an uncorrected significance threshold of p < 0.05. In unadjusted analyses assuming an additive genetic effect two SNPs had a nominally significant association with low EF ([Table 3](#T3) & [Figure 2](#F0002)). The variant allele of *ABCB1* 3435C>T (rs1045642) had an additive protective effect (odds ratio [OR] = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.23–1.00; p = 0.049). The second association was for the V244M variant in *CBR3* (rs1056892) which increased risk of EF <55% (OR = 2.50; 95% CI:1.22–5.11; p = 0.012), and an even stronger recessive genetic effect (OR = 6.19; 95% CI: 1.94–19.76; p = 0.002) ([Supplementary Table 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs.15.162/suppl_file/pgs-17-231-s1.docx)). Each additive association remained nominally significant after correction for clinical covariates (p = 0.048, p = 0.012, respectively) and when both genetic variables were included in the model simultaneously with the clinical covariates (p = 0.029, p = 0.008, respectively)

Two SNPs were significantly associated with systolic dysfunction (EF <55%) in the secondary pharmacogenetic screen of 23 candidate SNPs. The ABCB1 3435C>T variant (rs1045642, Figure 2A) was more common in controls than systolic dysfunction cases, providing an additive protective effect (odds ratio [OR] = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.23–1.00; p = 0.049). The CBR3 V244M (rs1056892, Figure 2B) SNP was found more often in cases than controls, with significantly increased risk in either an additive (OR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.22–5.11; p = 0.012) or recessive (OR = 6.19; 95% CI: 1.94–19.76; p = 0.002) genetic model. Note: Numbers do not add up to 166 due to missing genotypes in some patients (ABCB1: 4; CBR3: 3). EF: Ejection fraction.

## Discussion

Cardiotoxicity is a well-known side effect of doxorubicin that has led to a decline in use of this drug and substitution for nonanthracycline-based alternatives over the last few decades [[20](#B20)]. The exact mechanisms responsible for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy are not completely understood but multiple hypotheses including the creation of reactive oxygen species, the toxic effects of alcohol metabolites on cardiomyocytes, and the contribution of topoisomerase 2-beta (*TOP2B*) [[21](#B21)] have been proposed. Common variants in the genes involved in these processes could, in theory, affect the development of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the identification of genetic variants that predict anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity would enable clinicians to continue anthracycline use in patients most likely to benefit and least likely to experience toxicity. Unfortunately, this study was unable to validate the influence of three high priority candidate SNPs (*SLC28A3, RAC2, NCF4*) and did not detect the predicted association of a novel SNP in *TOP2B* with the occurrence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in this cohort.

Two SNPs that may be associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity were identified in an uncorrected exploratory secondary analysis. A common synonymous SNP (rs1045642, 3435C>T, Ile1145Ile) in *ABCB1*, which encodes the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, had a cardioprotective effect in this cohort. Three *ABCB1* SNPs that are in relatively strong linkage disequilibrium (r^2^ >0.8) were included in this analysis. These SNPs have been reported to increase systemic doxorubicin clearance [[22](#B22)], potentially explaining the decreased risk of systolic dysfunction in patients. Alternatively, cardiomyocytes are known to express P-gp [[23](#B23)] and cardiac tissue samples of *ABCB1* variant carriers have greater P-gp expression [[24](#B24)], suggesting that enhanced doxorubicin efflux within cardiomyocytes may provide the cardioprotective effect. However, a previous pharmacogenetic analysis that included rs1045642 did not detect a cardioprotective effect similar to that detected in our cohort [[8](#B8)].

The second SNP identified in this analysis is a nonsynonymous variant in *CBR3* (rs1056892, 730G>A, V244M). Previous pharmacogenetic analyses have reported a protective effect of this SNP, particularly at lower cumulative doxorubicin doses [[25](#B25),[26](#B26)], or detected no association for this variant with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity [[12](#B12),[27](#B27)]. Conversely, in our study this variant was more common in patients with systolic dysfunction than in control patients. The *CBR3* gene encodes for carbonyl reductase, which metabolizes doxorubicin to a toxic alcohol metabolite, doxorubicinol. This nonsynonymous SNP has lower doxorubicin metabolic activity *in vitro* [[28](#B28)], but patients carrying the variant genotype have been reported to have higher doxorubicinol exposure [[29](#B29)]. These intriguing but discordant findings, both clinically and preclinically, reveal a need for further investigation into the activity of this variant SNP and its importance in cardiotoxicity development.

None of the four SNPs selected as co-primary hypotheses were associated with cardiotoxicity in this cohort. A synonymous variant in *SLC28A3* (rs7853758, L461L) has been previously reported to be cardioprotective in multiple patient cohorts, with odds ratios of 0.35–0.42 [[9](#B9),[10](#B10)]. In our cohort, the effect of this SNP was in a consistent direction with a similar odds ratio (0.55), however, with a wide confidence interval (0.16–1.91). If this is a true effect, this silent polymorphism is either tagging a functionally consequential SNP, or this could be another potential example of a synonymous variant that affects protein activity [[30](#B30)]. Risk variants in *RAC2* (rs13058338) and *NCF4* (rs1883112) were first reported in a large case-control analysis by Wojnowski *et al*. [[8](#B8)] and replicated in independent cohorts [[11](#B11),[12](#B12)]. Similar to the nominal concordance of the *SLC28A3* results, the *NCF4* SNP that had been previously reported to increase risk was found more commonly in patients with cardiotoxicity in our cohort, with a slightly lower magnitude of association (1.44 vs 1.88–2.70). Again, this point estimate had a wide confidence interval (0.51–4.07), indicative of the imprecision of the estimate, which is likely due to the small number of cardiotoxicity events (n = 19) in this cohort. Alternatively, the nonsignificant results for *RAC2* and *TOP2B* were in the opposite direction of that previously published or hypothesized. Thus we were unable to replicate the associations of these SNPs with chronic anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in our cohort of breast cancer patients.

The fourth SNP selected as a primary hypothesis is an intronic SNP in *TOP2B* (rs2363520) that we hypothesized would be found more frequently in systolic dysfunction cases than controls. *TOP2B* expression is correlated with cellular sensitivity to doxorubicin [[31](#B31)] and the TOP2B protein is necessary for development of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in mice [[13](#B13)]. Using bioinformatics tools we identified a SNP (rs2363520) that is highly associated with *TOP2B* expression (p = 9 × 10^-6^) in lymphoblastoid cell lines [[32](#B32)]. The SNP we interrogated (rs10865801) in this analysis is in near perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs2363520 (r^2^ = 0.98) and is significantly associated with *TOP2B* gene expression in human heart left ventricle tissue specimens (p = 0.02) [[33](#B33)]. Other groups have previously investigated SNPs in TOP2B and not found associations with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity [[8](#B8)], however, we are the first to use a bioinformatics approach to directly interrogate a SNP known to affect *TOP2B* expression. Interestingly, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer identified a nonsynonymous variant in *RARG* (rs2229774) that affects *TOP2B* expression, providing further evidence that TOP2B is a key regulator of this toxicity [[34](#B34)]. Based on the preclinical and GWAS evidence the genetic predictors of TOP2B expression and function should be further investigated in pharmacogenetic analyses.

Critical limitations of this analysis, and differences with prior analyses, may explain the lack of replication of previously reported candidate SNPs. Among the 166 patients who received doxorubicin and underwent echocardiogram, few (n = 19) cases of doxorubicin-induced systolic dysfunction were identified, severely restricting study power. Due to the low study power for pharmacogenetic analysis it is only possible to conclude that the previously reported pharmacogenetic associations could not be validated in this cohort, not that the associations do not exist. The low event rate is likely due to the rarity of this toxicity at the doses of anthracyclines used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and also may partly be a consequence of the relatively young, healthy patient cohort enrolled on our study. Another important limitation to consider is that our analyses were restricted to patients who are still alive after treatment of their cancer years ago. Patients who died from cancer recurrence, other causes, or most importantly anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity would not have been included in this analysis so the event rate may have been higher if participation had not been conditional on survival. Furthermore, this analysis differs from the previous pharmacogenetic discovery and replication studies in critical ways. Prior associations for *SLC28A3* and cardiotoxicity were reported in cohorts of anthracycline-treated children [[9](#B9),[10](#B10)], whereas our cohort included only adults. The mechanisms and/or predictors of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity are likely to be distinct within these two treatment settings. The patients included in the analyses of *NCF4* and *RAC2* [[8](#B8),[11](#B11)] received doxorubicin concurrently with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) with or without rituximab (R-CHOP) on standard lymphoma protocols. The drugs and regimens used in lymphoma treatment are different from those used in the breast cancer patients in our cohort. Twenty percent of the patients in our cohort were treated with sequential use of cardiotoxic trastuzumab and 80% of patients received chest radiation, either of which may contribute to the inability to replicate these associations. It is possible that genetic predictors of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity are distinct in patients of different ages, tumor types and/or treatment regimens and pharmacogenetic discovery and validation will need to be conducted within large cohorts of similar patients receiving standardized treatment for a single tumor type, such as prospective clinical trial cohorts.

## Conclusion

The association of four candidate SNPs with putative effects on anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity could not be validated in an independent cohort of doxorubicin-treated breast cancer patients. A secondary pharmacogenetic screen of 23 SNPs detected associations for SNPs in *ABCB1* and *CBR3* with systolic dysfunction, though these uncorrected associations require additional replication in larger cohorts of patients with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Validation of these SNPs as predictors of cardiotoxicity would enable treatment individualization, via selection of alternative regimens, enhanced cardiotoxicity monitoring, modification of maximum cumulative doses, or possibly initiation of cardioprotective agents [[35](#B35)] to reduce the occurrence of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in women with breast cancer.

## Future perspective

Individualized prediction of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity will slowly make its way into clinical care. Over the next decade, analyses of large clinical trial cohorts will discover useful risk predictors that can be successfully validated in independent patient cohorts. These predictors will not be limited to genetics, but include clinical and biochemical features. These risk predictors will eventually be useful for estimating an individual patient's maximum anthracycline dose or selecting alternative therapeutic approaches for high-risk patients.
