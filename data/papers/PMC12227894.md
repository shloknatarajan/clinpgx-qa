## Abstract

We investigated the effects of age, sex, BMI, total number of prescribed daily pills, common biomarkers, and CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms on dose‐adjusted amlodipine concentration (CDR) in hypertensive patients. We also examined associations between the same covariates, dose, and serum amlodipine concentrations with uncontrolled hypertension. Amlodipine concentrations were measured in 471 patients treated with ≥ 2 antihypertensive drugs, with 50% having uncontrolled hypertension (daytime ambulatory blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg). CYP analyses were performed in a subgroup of 258 patients, 82% of these uncontrolled. Women used lower daily doses (p < 0.001) and had higher CDR (p < 0.001) than men. CDR increased with age (p < 0.001), reduced kidney function (p < 0.001) and CYP3A4*22 allele (p = 0.006). Patients with uncontrolled hypertension had lower CDR (p = 0.014). Women were half as likely as men to have uncontrolled hypertension (p = 0.002). At the group level, a 20 nmol/L increase in concentration, corresponding to adjustment from 5 to 10 mg, was associated with a 16.5% decreased probability of uncontrolled hypertension. Female sex, increasing age, reduced kidney function, and reduced CYP3A4 activity increased amlodipine CDR. The included covariates explained 41% of the amlodipine concentration variability. Females had a reduced probability of uncontrolled hypertension, and increased amlodipine concentration was associated with decreased probability of uncontrolled hypertension. We suggest using TDM of amlodipine as an aid for clinical decision‐making in cases of unsatisfactory treatment response, to identify possible non‐adherence or pharmacokinetic deviations.

## 1. Introduction

The prevalence of hypertension in the adult population is 25%–40% in western industrialized countries [[1](#prp270140-bib-0001), [2](#prp270140-bib-0002)]. The European guidelines for the management of hypertension address the proportion of patients with poorly controlled hypertension as well as the impact of pharmacokinetic variability [[3](#prp270140-bib-0003)]. Despite lifestyle intervention and drug treatment, about 30%–50% of the patients do not achieve their blood pressure (BP) goals [[1](#prp270140-bib-0001), [4](#prp270140-bib-0004), [5](#prp270140-bib-0005)], termed uncontrolled hypertension. The pharmacological reasons for uncontrolled hypertension can be physician inertia, that is, the physicians fail to initiate or intensify treatment according to current guidelines [[6](#prp270140-bib-0006)], drug non‐adherence, deviating serum drug concentration due to pharmacokinetic variability, and/or pharmacodynamic variation.

Amlodipine is a long‐acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) that inhibits calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilatation and thereby reduced peripheral vascular resistance and BP [[7](#prp270140-bib-0007)]. Amlodipine is one of the most frequently used drugs in antihypertensive treatment. Previously, in data collected from a national hypertension research project (*n* = 547), we found that 38% of the patients used amlodipine and of these 53% were treated with the highest recommended dosage of 10 mg daily [[8](#prp270140-bib-0008)]. Combination of a CCB with a drug that blocks the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is recommended as first line treatment in the European and international guidelines for the management of hypertension [[3](#prp270140-bib-0003), [9](#prp270140-bib-0009), [10](#prp270140-bib-0010)].

Compared to other CCBs, amlodipine has unique pharmacokinetic properties, including almost complete absorption, high bioavailability and protein binding, and a large volume of distribution (*V* _d_). It is extensively metabolized in the liver mainly by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) enzymes, with 5%–10% of the parent drug and 60% of its metabolites excreted in the urine. The long half‐life (*T* _1/2_: 35–50 h) allows once daily administration with relatively small fluctuations in serum concentration during the dosage interval [[7](#prp270140-bib-0007), [11](#prp270140-bib-0011), [12](#prp270140-bib-0012), [13](#prp270140-bib-0013)].

Maintenance dose of amlodipine in hypertension treatment is usually 5–10 mg daily [[11](#prp270140-bib-0011), [12](#prp270140-bib-0012)]. Inter‐individual variability in serum amlodipine concentration can be caused by genetic variation, environmental factors like diet and interacting drugs, as well as patient characteristics including age, sex, bodyweight, disease and adherence to drug treatment. There is little data on the variability of amlodipine serum concentrations in real‐life settings and also the relation to antihypertensive effects [[14](#prp270140-bib-0014)].

Elimination of amlodipine is largely dependent on hepatic metabolism, demonstrated by clinical studies reporting prolonged *T* _1/2_ and accumulation of amlodipine in patients with severe liver disease [[15](#prp270140-bib-0015)]. According to two drug reference works [[11](#prp270140-bib-0011), [12](#prp270140-bib-0012)] patients with hepatic insufficiency exhibit reduced clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in area under the time‐concentration curve (AUC) of approximately 40%–60%, requiring dose adjustment. Effects of CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms on serum amlodipine concentration have been investigated, but to date no conclusive evidence is able to link the CYP3A4/5 gene polymorphism to BP and efficacy of amlodipine, and no dose adjustment is recommended [[16](#prp270140-bib-0016)]. A single study showed that renal impairment has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine [[17](#prp270140-bib-0017)], and no dose adjustments are recommended with renal failure [[18](#prp270140-bib-0018), [19](#prp270140-bib-0019)].

Sex differences in serum amlodipine concentration have been demonstrated, with significantly higher concentration in females due to lower clearance [[20](#prp270140-bib-0020)]. Accordingly, adverse drug reactions have been reported to be more frequent in females compared to males [[21](#prp270140-bib-0021), [22](#prp270140-bib-0022)].

In summary, the existing studies on the pharmacokinetic variability of amlodipine are few and small, have often been conducted on healthy volunteers, and have shown some inconsistent results. In this study, we selected patients from a large national hypertension study with patients prescribed ≥ 2 antihypertensive drugs [[4](#prp270140-bib-0004), [23](#prp270140-bib-0023)]. The aim of our cross‐sectional study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic variability in patients using amlodipine as one of at least two antihypertensive drugs, by investigating the associations of the listed covariates on dose‐adjusted serum amlodipine concentration (CDR): age, sex, BMI, time since intake, total number of prescribed daily pills, common biomarkers of organ function/disease (absolute glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], alanine‐aminotransferase [ALAT], C‐reactive protein [CRP], albumin) and CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms. We hypothesized that the nine included covariates affect the CDR and that serum amlodipine concentration is reduced in patients with uncontrolled compared to controlled hypertension. Furthermore, we tested if any of the same covariates, including dose and serum drug concentration, differed in controlled and uncontrolled hypertension.

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1. Study Population

We utilized data from a national multicenter hypertension research project with 1156 patients performed in Norway in 2017–2022. Patients were included at the four major university hospitals in Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen, and Tromsø. A detailed description of the study inclusion and protocol has been published [[4](#prp270140-bib-0004), [23](#prp270140-bib-0023)]. The present sub‐study included 495 adult patients with hypertension using amlodipine, including patients with controlled and uncontrolled hypertension (systolic daytime ambulatory BP (ABPM) ≥ 135 mmHg) and prescribed ≥ 2 antihypertensive drugs and on a stable treatment regimen for at least 4 weeks. After signing the written informed consent, remaining uninformed about the intention to screen for non‐adherence and collection of serum samples for drug analyses, patients underwent a structured interview and examinations by a physician. The patients self‐reported current treatment with antihypertensive drugs and concomitant medication, including dose, time since last drug intake, and duration of treatment. The total number of prescribed daily antihypertensive and concomitant pills was calculated by summing all prescribed pills per week divided by seven.

Blood samples were used for the determination of serum amlodipine concentrations, biochemistry tests, and CYP‐genotypes. Patients with impaired kidney function with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2^ were excluded from the primary study but were kept in this substudy to examine the impact of reduced kidney function.

### 2.2. Ethics and Approvals

The study, registered at [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov), was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee and by the Data Protection Officer at Oslo University Hospital (OUH), in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Electronic data capture was managed with VieDoc (PCG Solutions, Uppsala, Sweden), approved by the local Data Safety Officer.

### 2.3. Quantification of Amlodipine

Amlodipine serum concentrations were measured with a previously published UHPLC–MS/MS method [[8](#prp270140-bib-0008)]. The standard range was 1–1000 nmol/L with a quadratic calibration curve with *R* ^2^ = 0.999. The lower limit of detection (LOD) was 0.65 nmol/L and the lower limit of quantification (LOQ) was 2.15 nmol/L. The accuracy (%) at control levels of 5, 250, and 800 nmol/L was 109.7–121.3–108.9 and the inter‐day precision (%) was 8.7–6.5–7.3 with an altogether mean total analytical uncertainty of 15.3%. A clinical pharmacologist at the Department of Pharmacology, OUH, assessed the amlodipine measurements in light of the patient‐reported drug list and previously reported dose‐adjusted serum amlodipine levels [[4](#prp270140-bib-0004), [8](#prp270140-bib-0008), [13](#prp270140-bib-0013)]. CDRs were calculated by dividing the measured amlodipine concentration by the patient's prescribed daily dose (mg/day). Patients with an amlodipine serum concentration below the LOQ (< 2.15 nmol/L) were excluded. The amlodipine concentration in nmol/L may be multiplied by a factor of 0.409 for conversion to ng/mL.

### 2.4. Biochemistry of Organ Function

Serum/plasma creatinine, ALAT, CRP, and albumin were analyzed at the four university hospitals recruiting patients in the study. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; mL/min/1.73 m^2^) by the CKD‐EPI equation [[24](#prp270140-bib-0024)] was automatically calculated in the laboratory information system. Absolute eGFR (mL/min) correlates with the individual renal excretion capacity, including the capacity to eliminate excreted drugs [[25](#prp270140-bib-0025)]. In our analysis, the absolute eGFR value was estimated by dividing relative eGFR by 1.73, then multiplying with the patient's body surface area (BSA), estimated from the Du Bois and Du Bois formula [[26](#prp270140-bib-0026)]:

| BSA=0.007184×Heightm0.725×Weightkg0.425 |
| --- |
We measured height, weight, waist, and hip circumference and calculated body mass index (BMI) and waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHI). A BMI ≥ 25 kg/m^2^ was defined as overweight and ≥ 30 as obesity [[27](#prp270140-bib-0027)].

### 2.5. Cytochrome P450 Testing

Genomic DNA from EDTA whole blood was extracted on a Magna Pure 96 instrument (Roche, Oslo, Norway) at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, OUH. The MassARRAY System was used to investigate single nucleotide variants for cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5 with the VeriDose Core Panel (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, California, USA). Each allele is associated with either normal, decreased, absent, increased or unknown enzyme function based on activity scores defined by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). The allele combination is used to predict the patient phenotypes for metabolizing drugs (PM = poor metabolizer, IM = intermediate metabolizer, NM = normal metabolizer, RM = rapid metabolizer, and UM = ultra‐rapid metabolizer) [[28](#prp270140-bib-0028)].

### 2.6. Statistics

Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented as either proportions, means with standard deviations (SD) for normally distributed data, or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for non‐normally distributed data. Differences in continuous variables between two groups were tested with Student's *t*‐test or Mann–Whitney *U* test, dependent on the normality of the distribution.

We used univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses to investigate the association of nine covariates with CDR as the dependent variable. The most common clinical biomarkers were selected. Normality of residuals was determined by visual inspection of QQ‐plots. Possible multicollinearity between the covariates was examined using Spearman's correlation coefficient with ≥ 0.7 as a cut‐off. The results from the regression analyses are presented as *β* coefficients, 95% confidence intervals, *p*‐values, and explained variance (*R* ^2^). The assumption of normal distribution was not met for ALAT and CRP, and because of this, the natural logarithmic transformation was performed to make the data suitable for linear regression.

For calculation of the effect size in the multiple linear regression model, Cohen's *f* ^2^ was used, *f* ^2^ = (*R* ^2^)/(1−*R* ^2^). Effect sizes are interpreted as small ≥ 0.02, medium ≥ 0.15 and large ≥ 0.35 [[29](#prp270140-bib-0029)].

Logistic regression results are reported as odds ratio (OR), corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and *p*‐value. *p* < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 29 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Study Population

Of the 1156 patients included in the national multicenter study, 495 used amlodipine (43%). Of these, 24 patients were excluded due to undetected amlodipine concentration (*n* = 5) and missing data (*n* = 19), such as time between last intake and sampling. Thus, 471 patients were included in this amlodipine sub‐study, of whom 319 (68%) were men and 152 (32%) were women. Four hundred and seventy‐one of these patients had valid ambulatory BP measurements, 221 (48%) had uncontrolled hypertension, ABPM ≥ 135 mmHg (mean ± SD 145.0 ± 8.7 mmHg), and 241 (52%) had controlled hypertension, ABPM < 135 mmHg (125.3 ± 6.8 mmHg). Table [1](#prp270140-tbl-0001) shows patient characteristics and clinical data, as well as amlodipine concentrations. Mean ± SD age of the patient group was 62 ± 11 years, and they were mostly of Caucasian origin (94%). A large majority (87%) of the patients were overweight, defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m^2^, with 47% of them classified as obese with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2^. No sex differences were observed. Twenty‐seven percent used three or more antihypertensive drugs. Only three patients had seriously impaired kidney function with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2^. ALAT and absolute eGFR were significantly lower among women compared to men. Age, BMI, albumin, and CRP did not differ by sex (Table [1](#prp270140-tbl-0001)).

### 3.2. Amlodipine Daily Dose and Serum Amlodipine Concentration in All 471 Patients

Figure [1A](#prp270140-fig-0001) shows the distribution of amlodipine CDR (nmol/L/mg) by time since last reported amlodipine intake. Eighty‐four percent of the samples were collected at *T* _max_ (2–8 h) after drug intake (range: 0.8–29.9 h). As amlodipine has a long half‐life (35–50 h), and the samples were collected after achieving steady state concentrations (5 × half‐life), we considered the difference between peak and trough concentrations to be relatively small and thus chose to include all amlodipine measurements in the analyses despite samples having been collected at different times after the last drug intake. In support of this, the ratio between mean serum concentration at *T* _max_ (*C* _max_) and at 24 h after intake (*C* _min_) was 1.4, confirming a relatively stable serum concentration throughout the dosing interval (Table [1](#prp270140-tbl-0001)).

In the box plots, the central line represents the median, the lower and upper borders of the boxes represent the interquartile range, and whiskers represent minimum and maximum levels excluding outliers. Circles and asterisks represent outliers and extreme outliers, defined as values exceeding the 3rd quartile by > 1.5 times and > 3 times the interquartile range, respectively. (A) Serum amlodipine concentration/dose versus time since last amlodipine intake. The interval between the dashed vertical lines represents the T max of 2–8 h. (B) Box‐plot of CDR according to sex. (C) Scatter plot showing the association between CDR and age. (D) Box‐plot showing CDR in patients with reduced kidney function, defined as absolute eGFR < 60 mL/min compared to normal kidney function.

Most patients used a daily dosage of 5 mg (*n* = 189 [40%]) or 10 mg (*n* = 274 [58%]) amlodipine (2.5 mg *n* = 5, 7.5 mg *n* = 1, 20 mg *n* = 2). There was a significant difference in median serum concentration between 5 and 10 mg (28 nmol/L vs. 52 nmol/L, *p* < 0.001) ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Figure [1](#prp270140-supitem-0001)). Because of these findings, the focus has been on the association of the covariates with CDR with the aim to identify factors influencing amlodipine pharmacokinetics independent of dosage. Univariable linear regression analysis showed that a higher dosage was associated with a higher serum drug concentration (*β* = 4.8, 95% CI 4.0–5.6, *p* < 0.001, *R* ^2^ = 0.22) ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Table [A](#prp270140-supitem-0001)), and in the adjusted model, dosage accounted for 25% of the variation in serum amlodipine concentration ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Table [B](#prp270140-supitem-0001)).

### 3.3. Sex‐ and Age‐Related Differences in Amlodipine Daily Dose and CDR

There was a significant difference in mean total daily dose of amlodipine between women and men (7.3 mg vs. 8.3 mg, *p* < 0.001). Women were also treated with a lower total number of antihypertensive pills per day than men (2.0 vs. 2.2, *p* = 0.015). Despite the lower daily amlodipine dosage, the mean serum amlodipine concentration was higher in women compared to men (51 nmol/L vs. 44 nmol/L, *p* < 0.022). Accordingly, median CDR was also significantly higher in women than in men (6.7 nmol/L/mg vs. 4.9 nmol/L/mg, *p* < 0.001), Figure [1B](#prp270140-fig-0001).

CDR was positively associated with age (*β* = 0.064, 95% CI 0.040–0.090, *p* < 0.001, *R* ^2^ = 0.054), indicating higher CDR in older patients (Figure [1C](#prp270140-fig-0001)). There was no significant difference in the age effect on CDR between the sexes (data not shown).

### 3.4. Effect of Biomarkers of Organ Function and Disease on Amlodipine CDR

Figure [1D](#prp270140-fig-0001) shows that patients with reduced kidney function, defined as absolute eGFR < 60 mL/min, had significantly higher median CDR than patients with normal kidney function (7.3 nmol/L/mg vs. 5.1 nmol/L/mg, *p* < 0.001).

Univariable linear regression analysis also showed a significant association between the absolute eGFR and CDR (*β* = −0.043, 95% CI −0.05 to −0.03, *p* < 0.001, *R* ^2^ = 0.125), accounting for 12.5% of the variation in CDR in this model. An interaction analysis revealed no significant difference in the adjusted eGFR effect on CDR between women and men (data not shown).

In the multivariable linear regression model, ALAT, CRP, and albumin were all significantly positively associated with CDR and did not differ between the sexes (see Tables [2A](#prp270140-tbl-0002) and [2B](#prp270140-tbl-0003)).

### 3.5. Effect of CYP3A4/5 Genetic Polymorphism on Amlodipine CDR

Genotyping of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 was performed in 258 of the 471 patients, most of them having uncontrolled hypertension (83%). Their mean age was 62 ± 10 years and 69 (27%) were females.

Among patients genotyped for CYP3A4, 242 patients had the *1/*1 genotype, 15 had *1/*22 (predictive of reduced enzyme activity) and 1 had *22/*22 (predictive of lacking enzyme activity). The combined *1/*22 and *22/*22 group had a non‐significantly higher median CDR compared to the normal group (6.0 nmol/L/mg vs. 5.1 nmol/L/mg), with a borderline *p*‐value of 0.062 (Figure [2](#prp270140-fig-0002)).

Among patients genotyped for CYP3A5, 215 patients had the *3/*3 genotype (predictive of lacking enzyme activity), 37 had *1/*3, 1 had *1/*6, 1 had *1/*7 (all predictive of reduced enzyme activity) and 4 had *1/*1. For patients without functional CYP3A5 (*3/*3—which is the most common genotype in the Caucasian population), the median CDR was 5.1 nmol/L/mg, whereas for patients with one and two functional alleles, the median CDR was 6.4 and 4.0 nmol/L/mg, respectively. This may suggest a possible reduction in median CDR in the patients with fully functional CYP3A5 enzyme. However, when comparing median CDR values of the no function group versus the slightly increased and increased enzyme activity groups combined, no significant difference was found (*p* = 0.11).

### 3.6. Association Between Covariates and Amlodipine CDR and Serum Drug Concentration

Table [2A](#prp270140-tbl-0002) shows the results of the univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis investigating possible factors associated with amlodipine CDR. We found significant increased CDR in the multivariable analysis by increasing age, female sex, lower total number of pills per day, shorter time since intake, reduced eGFR, and increased ALAT, albumin and CRP. BMI was not associated with amlodipine CDR neither in univariable nor multivariable analysis. In total these nine covariates accounted for 24% of the explained variance in amlodipine CDR (*R* ^2^ = 0.238). This corresponds to a moderate to large effect size (Cohens *f* ^2^ = 0.31). The time since intake accounts for only a small proportion of the total variance, *R* ^2^ = 0.015 ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Table [C](#prp270140-supitem-0001)).

In patients genotyped for CYP3A4/5 enzymes (*n* = 258) separate univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between genotypes and CDR (Table [2A](#prp270140-tbl-0002)). The association between the carriers of the CYP3A4 *22 allele and CDR was tested with simple linear regression analysis (*β* = 1.9, 95% CI 0.40–3.40, *p* = 0.013, *R* ^2^ = 0.024) indicating a 30% increase in the group with reduced function compared to the group with normal enzyme activity in this model. The multivariable analysis confirmed that CYP3A4 *1/*22 and *22/*22 were significantly positively associated with amlodipine CDR (*β*: 1.94, 95% CI 0.56–3.32, *p* = 0.006), while CYP3A5 variants were not significantly associated with amlodipine CDR when adjusting for clinical covariates. The same nine covariates in the multivariable model with CYP enzymes explained 28% of the variance in amlodipine CDR (*R* ^2^ = 0.281) (Table [2B](#prp270140-tbl-0003)), and CYP accounted for 3% of the variation in CDR ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Table [D](#prp270140-supitem-0001); Tables [2A](#prp270140-tbl-0002) and [2B](#prp270140-tbl-0003)).

The association of the same nine covariates and the dose with amlodipine serum drug concentration as dependent variable was also investigated. The explained variance in serum amlodipine concentration was then 41% (*R* ^2^ = 0.408) ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Table [A](#prp270140-supitem-0001)). For the overall contribution of the covariates on serum amlodipine concentration, see Figure [3](#prp270140-fig-0003).

The overall contribution of the 10 covariates explain 41%, including CYP 3%, of the pharmacokinetic variability of amlodipine serum concentration in this model.

### 3.7. Investigating Relationship Between Covariates and Uncontrolled Hypertension

Patients with uncontrolled hypertension had significantly lower mean amlodipine CDR compared to patients with controlled hypertension at group level (5.6 nmol/L/mg vs. 6.3 nmol/L/mg; *p* = 0.014), but there was no significant difference in serum drug concentration (44.4 nmol/L vs. 48.0 nmol/L; *p* = 0.14).

Multiple logistic regression analysis with controlled and uncontrolled HT as binary dependent variable, revealed that among the 11 variables investigated (the nine covariates, dose and serum concentration), sex was the only variable significantly associated with uncontrolled hypertension. Female sex was associated with a 50% reduction in the odds of uncontrolled hypertension (OR 0.504, 95% CI 0.323–0.786, *p* = 0.003). Serum amlodipine concentration showed a borderline association (OR 0.915, 95% CI 0.831–1.007, *p* = 0.069), that is, a 20‐unit increase in concentration, corresponding to a dose increase from 5 to 10 mg in our data ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Figure [1](#prp270140-supitem-0001)), was associated with a 16.5% decreased probability of uncontrolled hypertension (Figure [4](#prp270140-fig-0004)).

## 4. Discussion

Results from the multivariable analysis showed significant positive associations between female sex, age, ALAT, albumin, and CRP, and negative associations between the number of pills, time since last drug intake, absolute eGFR, and CDR. The use of dose‐adjusted concentration (CDR) allowed evaluation of pharmacokinetic factors without the influence of the dose. According to these findings, female sex, increasing age, higher levels of albumin, ALAT, and CRP, low total number of daily pills, reduction in eGFR, and short time since drug take all will be related to higher CDR levels. The time since last intake contributed very little to the variability in amlodipine CDR. The overall contribution of these nine covariates explained 24% of the variation in CDR in our population. When CYP genotype was also added to the nine variants, the contribution was 28%. The same nine covariates, with the addition of dosage, explained 41% of the variation in serum amlodipine concentration.

In contrast to a recent report [[30](#prp270140-bib-0030)] women in our study (mean age > 60) were half as likely as men to have uncontrolled hypertension, and this was independent of age, renal function, and BMI. Abad‐Santos et al. [[31](#prp270140-bib-0031)] reported more pronounced BP decrease in women compared to men. Kloner et al. [[32](#prp270140-bib-0032)] found that amlodipine therapy reduced BP more in women, who also had a higher incidence of adverse reactions. Rydberg et al. [[22](#prp270140-bib-0022)] also reported a higher prevalence of adverse drug events in females for 6 of 10 antihypertensive drugs, including amlodipine. Thus, sex differences in BP effects and side effects of amlodipine are well‐documented.

Amlodipine serum concentration was higher in women, whereas the average dose was lower. Higher drug concentration could lead to higher efficacy and/or more side effects, and therefore a reduction in amlodipine dosage. Sex‐specific pharmacokinetic differences are well documented for other CCBs like verapamil [[33](#prp270140-bib-0033), [34](#prp270140-bib-0034)] and nifedipine [[35](#prp270140-bib-0035)], but the documentation is scarce for amlodipine. Even so, a few studies have reported lower clearance and increased serum drug concentration of amlodipine in women compared to men, consistent with our findings [[20](#prp270140-bib-0020), [36](#prp270140-bib-0036), [37](#prp270140-bib-0037)]. Although BMI was similar between the sexes in our population, the lower body weight of females may possibly explain the higher CDR compared to males. Females have smaller organs (liver, kidney) and lower organ blood flow, primarily due to differences in body size and cardiac output, leading to lower drug clearance [[21](#prp270140-bib-0021)]. Liver metabolism is the main elimination pathway of amlodipine; hence, significant differences in liver mass could affect drug clearance. Lipophilic agents such as amlodipine tend to have a larger *V* _d_ in females [[21](#prp270140-bib-0021)]. This would be expected to lead to lower drug concentration in females initially; however, the steady‐state concentration is primarily influenced by clearance and not *V* _d_. In addition to the differences related to body size, sex‐based differences in drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4/5) and transporters (P‐glycoprotein) might also play a role [[38](#prp270140-bib-0038)].

In addition, in the adjusted logistic regression model there was a trend toward lower amlodipine concentration in the patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the group level. A 20 nmol/L increase in concentration was associated with a 16.5% decrease in the probability of uncontrolled hypertension with a *p*‐value of 0.069, which is slightly above the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance. Considering that a doubling of the dose from 5 to 10 mg gave an increase in the serum concentration by 24 nmol/L (86%) ([Supporting Information](#prp270140-supitem-0001): Figure [1](#prp270140-supitem-0001)) we consider that a 20 nmol/L increase in serum amlodipine concentration is likely to result in a reduction of the BP in our population. This is consistent with controlled clinical trials that have demonstrated a linear relationship between amlodipine concentration and the reduction in BP [[14](#prp270140-bib-0014), [39](#prp270140-bib-0039), [40](#prp270140-bib-0040)].

In contrast, we found no significant association between the total daily dose and the probability of having uncontrolled hypertension. We found no difference in total daily amlodipine dose between the groups that could explain our results. A recent study from Seleznev et al. [[41](#prp270140-bib-0041)] (*n* = 46) concluded that serum concentrations of amlodipine did not differ between patients with controlled and uncontrolled hypertension. The discrepancies between the studies may be due to our larger study population (*n* = 462).

CDR of amlodipine was positively correlated with age, indicating higher amlodipine concentration in older patients. This is comparable to other studies of amlodipine [[42](#prp270140-bib-0042)] as well as for other low‐extraction drugs exhibiting age‐related increase in drug concentration due to decreased drug clearance [[43](#prp270140-bib-0043)]. The association seen in our study may be explained by the general physiological changes seen in the elderly.

Interestingly, we found a significant increase in CDR with decreased kidney function. Only 5%–10% of the parent compound is excreted unchanged in the urine, and the general prescription recommendations do not indicate that renal insufficiency modifies the disposition of amlodipine or necessitates dose adjustments [[18](#prp270140-bib-0018), [19](#prp270140-bib-0019)]. However, others report that renal insufficiency may affect amlodipine clearance and that dose adjustment may be required [[11](#prp270140-bib-0011), [12](#prp270140-bib-0012)]. The latter is in agreement with our findings and could be due to accumulation of metabolites, competing for transport into hepatocytes as well as for hepatic enzymes and thereby decreasing hepatic drug metabolism. This has been described for other drugs like oxazepam and propranolol [[44](#prp270140-bib-0044), [45](#prp270140-bib-0045)].

Amlodipine is mainly (90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic breakdown by CYP3A4/5. We observed that the presence of the CYP3A4 *22 allele was associated with close to 30% higher CDR in the univariable linear regression analysis, which is comparable to the findings in a similar study [[46](#prp270140-bib-0046), [47](#prp270140-bib-0047)]. Homozygous carriers of the CYP3A5*3 allele express a non‐functional CYP3A5 enzyme. This defective allele variant *3 is the most frequent (85%–95%) in Asian and Caucasian populations, whereas the wild‐type allele, CYP3A5*1, is the most frequent in the African population (69%–88%) [[48](#prp270140-bib-0048), [49](#prp270140-bib-0049)]. We did not find any significant effects of the presence of the CYP3A5*1 allele on the amlodipine CDR, possibly because of the low frequency of CYP3A5*1 carriers in our population. Data on the impact of CYP3A5 allele carriership are scarce and conflicting [[46](#prp270140-bib-0046), [50](#prp270140-bib-0050)].

We did not find any association between BMI and amlodipine CDR. This may be due to the large proportion of participants with increased BMI in our population. We expected a positive association between BMI and amlodipine CDR, since it has been demonstrated that the drug elimination capacity decreases due to reduced CYP3A4 enzyme activity in obese patients [[51](#prp270140-bib-0051)].

The main strength of our study is the large number of patients included, representing a real‐life, heterogeneous patient group undergoing hypertension treatment, including patients with both controlled and uncontrolled hypertension. We also performed extensive BP measurements, allowing us to make inferences about the influence of amlodipine serum concentration on the odds for developing uncontrolled hypertension.

A limitation to our study is that the nine covariates explored only explained 24% of the total inter‐individual variability in amlodipine CDR. Adding the dose explained 41% of the variance in serum amlodipine concentration. Furthermore, our data indicates that increasing total number of prescribed daily pills will reduce the CDR and serum amlodipine concentration implying that drug interactions or non‐adherence can play a role in our study. Thus, other factors constitute the majority of the variation in serum drug concentration. Variation in adherence, use of interacting drugs or herbal medicines, chronic inflammatory disease and other unknown factors may be possible causes of fluctuations in the serum concentration not accounted for in our analyses.

According to standard therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) routines, blood samples should be collected at steady state (i.e., after five half‐lives) and at the end of the dosing interval (trough concentration) [[52](#prp270140-bib-0052)]. This study is a sub‐study of a national multicenter hypertensive study that was a prospective randomized control trial (RCT) testing if TDM could improve drug adherence and subsequent BP control. It was therefore important that the patients remained uninformed about the intention to screen for non‐adherence and the collection of serum samples for drug analyses. It should be noted that adherence to medication and the time of last drug intake were self‐reported, and we cannot exclude erroneous reporting and partial non‐adherence in some subjects. As well, the pragmatic design of the primary study, by sampling throughout the dosing interval, introduces additional variation in serum concentrations, although the time from last intake to sampling was included as a covariate in the regression model. However, the pharmacokinetic properties of amlodipine, with a long *T* _1/2_ and a modest *C* _max_, illustrated by a *C* _max_/*C* _min_ ratio close to 1, imply this source of variation is small.

Our study included mainly Caucasian patients. Thus, it is not surprising that the CYP3A5*1 allele did not show any significant effect on serum amlodipine concentration. The impact of expressing an active CYP3A5 enzyme on amlodipine disposition should therefore be explored in a population with a higher prevalence of the CYP3A5*1 allele.

Our findings provide new insights into the variation in serum amlodipine concentrations and how the tested covariates contributed to uncontrolled hypertension in our study population. The updated European Guidelines [[3](#prp270140-bib-0003)] do not consider sex‐specific treatment recommendations to be necessary, but some studies conclude differently and report sex‐specific differences in therapeutic treatment effect and adverse reactions [[22](#prp270140-bib-0022), [31](#prp270140-bib-0031), [32](#prp270140-bib-0032)]. It is unclear whether the differences in serum concentrations between groups of the magnitude observed in our study are clinically relevant, but our results indicate that the concentration‐dependent effectiveness of amlodipine therapy needs to be explored further.

Traditionally, antihypertensive drugs did not qualify for TDM given that the effect can easily be measured by monitoring BP. However, it is a well‐known fact that only 30%–50% of treated hypertensive patients achieve the target BP values. TDM involves measuring serum concentration combined with clinical interpretation (BP) and assessment of the result based on therapeutic reference ranges. A therapeutic reference range has not been defined for amlodipine. This requires supportive evidence of a relationship between drug concentration and clinical outcome. In absence of therapeutic reference ranges, a dose‐related reference range to aid the interpretation of amlodipine serum concentrations has been proposed to identify non‐adherence and pharmacokinetic outliers [[13](#prp270140-bib-0013)]. This has been applied for other medications like psychotropic drugs [[53](#prp270140-bib-0053)]. TDM can then function as an objective and valuable tool for physicians to exclude non‐adherence [[54](#prp270140-bib-0054)], reduce physician inertia [[6](#prp270140-bib-0006)], as well as identify unexpected pharmacokinetic deviations as a first step toward better BP control. The pharmacokinetic properties of amlodipine make it very suitable for TDM since samples can be collected at any time point in the dose interval without introducing too much variability compared to trough sampling. In combination with our results indicating that amlodipine concentrations vary greatly between individuals, this implies that TDM can be a meaningful tool to guide treatment and dose optimization. This is illustrated by the association of amlodipine CDR with sex, age, kidney function and presence of the CYP3A4*22 allele found in our study, which has also been noted by Versmissen et al. [[55](#prp270140-bib-0055)].

TDM can be useful in the situation when patients are titrated to the maximum dose but experience inadequate BP effect. *Unexpectedly low or undetectable serum concentrations* may then indicate total or partial non‐adherence, or pharmacokinetic factors that increase drug elimination (CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms or interactions with CYP3A4/5 inducers). In such cases, TDM can help reduce physician inertia by facilitating safe and confident treatment intensification even if it means prescribing doses outside the recommended range. *Serum concentrations in the expected dose‐related reference range* without adequate blood pressure response may suggest true treatment resistance, and addition of or switch to another antihypertensive agent may be appropriate. *High serum concentrations in combination with possible concentration‐related adverse effects* may suggest impaired drug elimination (CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms, interactions with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, or reduced renal or hepatic function), and a dose reduction or switch to another agent should be considered. Importantly, a single low measurement cannot distinguish between patients who only use their drugs intermittently or have deviating pharmacokinetics, and repeated measurements may be needed. The TDM results may strengthen the patient‐physician relationship and stress the need for medication adherence to achieve an adequate BP‐lowering effect. Unexpected changes in response, tolerability, disease status, co‐medication, etc. may also be an indication to repeat the measurement. The dose‐related reference may be helpful to identify pharmacokinetic outliers and non‐adherence [[13](#prp270140-bib-0013)]. However, a better characterization of the relationship between amlodipine concentrations and pharmacodynamic outcomes is desired to fulfill the potential of TDM of amlodipine as a clinical tool.

In conclusion, this study of 471 patients showed that female sex, increasing age, reduced kidney function and a CYP3A4 genotype encoding reduced enzyme activity were associated with higher dose‐adjusted amlodipine serum concentration. Overall, the covariates explored in this study explained 41% of the variation in serum amlodipine concentration. Females had reduced probability of having uncontrolled hypertension compared to men and increase in serum amlodipine concentration was associated with a decreased probability of uncontrolled hypertension. Our findings do not support the routine use of TDM of amlodipine. TDM may rather be seen as a supplement in clinical situations with inadequate treatment response or unexpectedly strong adverse effects, to identify possible non‐adherence or pharmacokinetic deviations, thereby aiding clinical decisions for further treatment.
