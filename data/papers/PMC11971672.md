## Abstract

**Question:** 
Does the risk of cardiovascular events among patients receiving clopidogrel for patients with acute ischemic stroke differ according to their cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genotype?

**Findings:** 
In this nonrandomized clinical trial that included 2925 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel, patients who were carriers of the loss-of-function CYP2C19 allele exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events. There were no significant differences in the incidence of major bleeding or all-cause mortality between carriers and noncarriers.

**Meaning:** 
These findings suggest that clopidogrel may be less effective in preventing cardiovascular events in patients who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles.

### Question

Does the risk of cardiovascular events among patients receiving clopidogrel for patients with acute ischemic stroke differ according to their cytochrome P450 2C19 (*CYP2C19*) genotype?

### Findings

In this nonrandomized clinical trial that included 2925 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel, patients who were carriers of the loss-of-function *CYP2C19* allele exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events. There were no significant differences in the incidence of major bleeding or all-cause mortality between carriers and noncarriers.

### Meaning

These findings suggest that clopidogrel may be less effective in preventing cardiovascular events in patients who are carriers of loss-of-function *CYP2C19* alleles.

### Importance

Cytochrome P450 2C19 (*CYP2C19*) genotypes influence the antiplatelet effectiveness of clopidogrel by affecting its conversion to its active metabolite. However, evidence from prospective trials regarding the effects of *CYP2C19* genotypes on the role of clopidogrel preventing cardiovascular events among patients with acute ischemic stroke remains limited.

### Objective

To investigate the association of the *CYP2C19* genotypes with the clinical prognosis of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel.

### Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted from September 1, 2019, to January 27, 2023, at 37 clinical sites in South Korea. Patients who received clopidogrel within 72 hours of experiencing an acute ischemic stroke were included.

### Interventions

Patients were classified using *CYP2C19* genotyping into carrier and noncarrier of *CYP2C19* loss-of-function (LOF) allele. Clopidogrel treatment was maintained throughout the study period.

### Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the difference in the risk of cardiovascular events (including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) within 6 months after an ischemic stroke between patients who were carriers or noncarriers of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele. The primary safety outcomes were the differences in all-cause mortality and the occurrence of major bleeding. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

### Results

Overall, 2925 patients were enrolled in the PLATELET trial. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 65.3 (12.4) years, and 1928 (66.3%) were men. Among these patients, 15 were excluded. Of the remaining 2910 patients, 61.3% were classified as poor or intermediate metabolizers and 38.7% as extensive metabolizers. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in carriers of the LOF *CYP2C19* allele than in noncarriers (2.7% [49 of 1785] vs 1.6% [18 of 1125]; log-rank *P* = .048). No significant differences were observed between *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and noncarriers regarding the occurrence of major bleeding (0.6% [11 of 1785] vs 0.8% [9 of 1125]; *P* = .56) and all-cause mortality (0.3% [5] vs 0.1% [1]; *P* = .27).

### Conclusions and Relevance

In this prospective nonrandomized clinical trial, carriers of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele genotype exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events.

## Introduction

Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug used for secondary prevention in patients with a history of stroke, coronary artery disease, or peripheral artery disease.^1^ Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine prodrug that is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the liver to an active metabolite with antiplatelet activity. Consequently, the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel might be insufficient when its metabolism is disrupted, such as when medications that are competitively metabolized by the same CYP are administered concomitantly or because of CYP genotypes associated with poor metabolism.^2^ Studies have reported that *CYP2C19* genotype, the metabolic enzyme of clopidogrel, affects the effectiveness of clopidogrel and the risk of cardiovascular disease.^3,4,5,6,7^ In patients with acute or transient ischemic attack, the use of aspirin with clopidogrel reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared with aspirin monotherapy in noncarriers of the *CYP2C19* loss of function (LOF) allele.^3,8^ However, evidence from prospective trials on the effect of the *CYP2C19* genotype on the cardiovascular event preventive role of clopidogrel in patients with acute ischemic stroke is still limited. This PLATELET trial aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular events differs in patients receiving clopidogrel for acute ischemic stroke according to their *CYP2C19* genotypes.

## Methods

### Design

The PLATELET trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label trial conducted at 37 sites in South Korea. Patients were enrolled from September 1, 2019, through January 27, 2023. The details of the rationale and design of the PLATELET trial have been published and are revealed in the trial protocol ([Supplement 1](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)), trial protocol amendment ([Supplement 2](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)), Statistical Analysis Plan ([Supplement 3](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)), and the eMethods in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s).^9^ All study patients received clopidogrel and the presence of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele was assessed. An independent data and safety monitoring board had access to all data and monitored the trial. The outcome event was confirmed by the committee members who were blinded to the *CYP2C19* genotype result. Trial monitoring was performed by an external service provider (Synex; South Korea). Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their representatives before screening; participants did not receive financial compensation. The institutional review boards of all participating hospitals approved this study. This study followed the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations With Nonrandomized Designs ([TREND](https://www.cdc.gov/hivpartners/php/trend-statement/index.html)) reporting guideline.

### Patient Population and Clinical Variables

Patients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke and received clopidogrel, 75-300 mg, within 72 hours of stroke onset and underwent *CYP2C19* genotyping were enrolled. The timing of the index stroke was determined based on the first appearance of associated neurologic abnormalities. Because this was a nonrandomized trial, there were no restrictions regarding clopidogrel administration. Combination therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel was permitted at the physician’s discretion. However, the administration of other antiplatelets or anticoagulants was restricted and clopidogrel therapy was maintained until the end of the study. The participants were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment to monitor the occurrence of cardiovascular events and adverse reactions.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: (1) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed using brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance image, (2) received clopidogrel within 72 hours after stroke onset, (3) were older than 19 years, (4) agreed to participate in the study within 7 days after stroke onset, and (5) completed *CYP2C19* genotyping. We excluded patients who met the following criteria: (1) received oral anticoagulants at the time of screening or were scheduled to take the medication within 6 months; (2) required antiplatelet agents other than aspirin and clopidogrel; (3) had received clopidogrel within 1 week before the index ischemic stroke; (4) were scheduled for coronary angioplasty, coronary stent insertion, coronary artery bypass grafting, carotid endarterectomy, or cerebral artery stent implantation within 6 months; (5) received diagnoses of severe comorbidities with an expected life span of less than 2 years or a malignant tumor that had not been cured; (6) had participated in another drug trial within the previous 30 days; (7) had findings corresponding to high-risk factors among the causes of cardiac embolism according to Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification^1^; and (8) had expected difficulty participating and continuing in this study according to the researcher’s judgment.

### Measure and Classification of CYP2C19 Genotypes

Based on the result of *CYP2C19* genotyping (**1*, **2*, **3*, and **17* alleles), we defined extensive metabolizers as patients with **1/*1*, **1/*17*, and **17/*17* genotypes; intermediate metabolizers as patients with only one **2* or **3* genotypes (**1/*2*, **1/*3*, **2/*17*, and **3/*17*); and poor metabolizers as patients with only **2* or **3* genotypes (**2/*2*, **2/*3*, and **3/*3*). In line with the study protocol, we dichotomized patients into the LOF allele carrier (intermediate or poor metabolizer group) and LOF allele noncarrier (extensive metabolizer group).^3,10,11^

### Outcomes

The primary outcome measure was the difference in cardiovascular events (stroke, including ischemic or hemorrhagic, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) within 6 months after an ischemic stroke between patients categorized as carrier or noncarrier of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment. The secondary outcome was the difference in the development of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack without brain imaging lesions, myocardial infarction, coronary artery revascularization procedures within 6 months, and deterioration of neurologic symptoms within 7 days or good functional outcome at 3 months after the initial stroke (modified Rankin scale 0-2) between carrier and noncarrier of the LOF allele. The safety outcome assessed the difference in all-cause mortality and the occurrence of major bleeding events, including fatal bleeding, symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage, ocular bleeding, bleeding requiring transfusion of 2 or more pints of blood, or bleeding requiring hospitalization within 6 months.

### Covariates

We evaluated the differences in the risks for the primary outcomes according to the *CYP2C19* genotypes (eTable 1 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). Preplanned subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, hypertension, diabetes, initial stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score), and TOAST classification. Detailed information on the covariates is available in the published study protocol.^9^ The detailed method for estimating the sample size is described in the eMethods in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s).

### Statistical Analysis

Baseline characteristics are presented according to the *CYP2C19* genotype groups (carrier and noncarrier of the LOF allele). Categorical variables are presented as numbers (percentage), and continuous variables as median (IQR) or mean (SD), as appropriate. *P* values were determined using the χ^2^ test, Fisher exact test, independent *t* test, and Mann-Whitney test. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle for the outcomes. To assess the risk of developing a primary outcome within 6 months, participants were followed up until the occurrence of cardiovascular events or were censored at their last follow-up assessment or at the time of withdrawal from the study, whichever occurred first. The cumulative risks of the primary outcome, ischemic or hemorrhagic event, and bleeding events during the 180-day follow-up period are reported as Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test and cumulative incidence plot. The multivariable model was used to analyze the influence of *CYP2C19* genotype groups on the primary outcome, adjusting for covariates including age, sex, obesity, vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking history), TOAST classification, history of cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke), estimated glomerular filtration rate, aspirin therapy during admission, platelet reactivity unit, and NIHSS score. Due to overfitting in multivariable analysis, TOAST classification was entered separately as small-vessel occlusion or large-artery atherosclerosis. The NIHSS score was adjusted with ordinal variables because of nonnormal distribution. For sensitivity analysis, 1:1 propensity-weighted matching analysis for carriers and noncarriers of the LOF allele was performed (eMethods in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). Cox proportional hazards regression methods were used for calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). All hypothesis tests were 2-sided with a significance threshold set at 5%.

## Results

### Participants and Follow-Up

From September 1, 2019, through January 27, 2023, a total of 2925 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [12.4] years; 1928 men [66.3%]; 982 women [33.7%]) were enrolled from 37 clinical sites in the PLATELET trial. Fifteen patients were excluded from the study due to protocol violation. The final analysis comprised 2910 patients, with 1785 (61.3%) identified as carriers of the LOF allele and 1125 (38.7% [1125]) as noncarriers of the LOF allele (eFigure in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). No significant differences were observed in the baseline demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and medical history between the 2 groups except for the history of cerebral infarction ([Table 1](#zoi250037t1)). The proportion of patients with a history of cerebral infarction was higher in the LOF allele carriers (8.9% [158 of 1785]) than in the noncarriers (6.6% [74 of 1125]) (*P* = .03). According to the TOAST classification, 30.0% of the patients (872 of 2910) had large-artery atherosclerosis and 41.0% had lacunar infarction (1192 of 2910). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in stroke classification, laboratory results, initial NIHSS score, and aspirin use during hospitalization. The proportion of patients with the intermediate metabolizer phenotype was 47.8% (n = 1391) and the proportion of poor metabolizers was 13.5% (n = 394).

### Primary Outcomes

Overall, 49 of 1785 LOF allele carriers (2.7%) and 18 of 1125 LOF allele noncarriers (1.6%) experienced cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality at 180 days. [Figure 1](#zoi250037f1) shows the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events among patients with different *CYP2C19* genotypes. The primary outcome of composite cardiovascular events occurred significantly more in the LOF allele carrier group (49 of 1785 [2.7%]) compared with the noncarrier group (18 of 1125 [1.6%]) (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-1.00; *P* = .048 for log-rank test). [Table 2](#zoi250037t2) reports the incidence rate for effectiveness and safety outcomes. There was no significant difference between the LOF allele carrier and noncarrier groups regarding the occurrence of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related death. However, stroke recurrence was more frequent in the LOF allele carrier group (45 [2.5%]) than in the LOF allele noncarrier group (16 [1.4%]) (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-1.00; *P* = .047).

### Secondary Outcomes

Regarding secondary outcomes, ischemic stroke events occurred in 42 patients (2.4%) in the LOF allele carrier group and 15 (1.4%) patients in the LOF allele noncarrier group, with no significant difference (*P* = .06). Other outcomes were not significantly different between the groups ([Table 2](#zoi250037t2)).

### Safety Outcomes

There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the occurrence of a major bleeding event (11 of 1785 [0.6%] in LOF allele carriers and 9 of 1125 [0.8%] in LOF allele noncarriers; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.53-3.13; *P* = .56), noncardiogenic death (3 [0.2%]) in LOF allele carriers and 1 [0.1%] in LOF allele noncarriers; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.56-5.08; *P* = .58). In addition, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (5 [0.3%] in LOF allele carriers and 1 [0.1%] in LOF allele noncarriers; HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.04-2.71; *P* = .27 for log-rank test) ([Figure 2](#zoi250037f2)).

### Secondary Analysis

To explore the potential interaction between *CYP2C19* genotypes and covariates for the primary outcome, we performed a subgroup analysis (eTable 2 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). Among smokers, LOF allele noncarriers had significantly less occurrence of the primary outcome compared with LOF allele carriers (HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.64; *P* = .02; *P* = .03 for interaction). In other subgroups, such as age and obesity, no significant differences were observed between LOF allele carriers and noncarriers. There was no possible site effect according to included locations (eTable 3 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). In sensitivity analysis, even after propensity-weighted score matching, main results were still consistent with those of before propensity-weighted score matching (eTable 4 and eTable 5 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)).

When comparing the intermediate metabolizer group with the poor metabolizer group as the reference, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of the primary outcome (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.49-1.88; *P* = .92). Additionally, no significant difference was observed in patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel combination therapy (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.50-1.93; *P* = .98) between the intermediate and poor metabolizer groups. The primary outcome did not occur in patients who received clopidogrel monotherapy; therefore, statistical analysis could not be performed between the intermediate and poor metabolizer groups in patients who received clopidogrel monotherapy.

### Result of Cox Regression Analysis

To address the potential influence of age, sex, and risk factors on the primary outcomes, a multivariate Cox regression model was constructed. This model included *CYP2C19* genotype, age, sex, TOAST classification, eGFR, and risk factors ([Table 3](#zoi250037t3)). The results indicated that the intermediate metabolizer genotype (adjusted HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.33-0.99; *P* = .049) and classification of small-vessel occlusion (adjusted HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; *P* = .003) were protective factors for the primary outcome.

## Discussion

This prospective, multicenter, large, nonrandomized PLATELET clinical trial evaluated the primary outcome of cardiovascular events according to the *CYP2C19* genotype in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel. The risk of cardiovascular events within 6 months was significantly lower in LOF allele noncarriers (1.6%) than in LOF allele carriers (2.7%) (log-rank *P* = .048). Stroke recurrence was more common among LOF allele carriers (2.5%) than noncarriers (1.4%). There was no significant difference between the 2 genotypes regarding the incidence of major bleeding. Our study suggests that the *CYP2C19* genotype of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel exhibits different probabilities of composite cardiovascular events, particularly recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke.

Our study encompassed all patients with stroke, regardless of stroke severity, and excluded patients with transient ischemic attack, unlike the Association Between *CYP2C19* Loss-of-Function Allele Status and Efficacy of Clopidogrel for Risk Reduction Among Patients With Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (CHANCE) and Clopidogrel and Aspirin in Acute Ischemic Stroke and High-Risk TIA (POINT) trials,^3,8^ which included only patients with minor stroke events and transient ischemic attack. Treatment in all patients in our study was maintained with clopidogrel. This approach is more reflective of what happens in clinical practice settings among patients with ischemic stroke receiving clopidogrel. The primary outcome of this prospective trial was the risk of cardiovascular events, and we documented the differences in risk according to the *CYP2C19* genotype in 2910 Korean patients treated with clopidogrel. This study provides evidence that the *CYP2C19* genotype is directly associated with the estimated clinical outcome of patients receiving treatment with clopidogrel for acute cerebral infarction. These findings are consistent with a previous systematic review on this topic, which included 15 studies, 12 of which were conducted in Asian populations.^12^

Loss of function allele carriers of the *CYP2C19* genotype account for approximately 30% of the White population and approximately 60% of the Asian population.^12,13,14^ Given this high prevalence of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers among Asian populations, it is crucial to determine the influence of the metabolizer phenotype on antiplatelet therapy allocations and clinical outcomes. Consistent with prior data from randomized clinical trials and observational studies, our study findings provide additional evidence supporting genetic testing that may allow clinicians to personalize antiplatelet therapy, especially for Asian populations, where the prevalence of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers is high.^3,4,13,15,16^ The CHANCE-2 randomized clinical trial has documented that treatment with ticagrelor, another potent antiplatelet not affected by the *CYP2C19* genotype, was superior in the secondary prevention of stroke among *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers.^16^ Regarding the high prevalence of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and their worse prognosis with clopidogrel treatment shown in this study, we suggest that genetic testing and personalized antiplatelet therapy would be reasonable for the prevention of secondary cardiovascular events among Asian patients with acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, antiplatelet agents with less metabolic variability, such as ticagrelor, could serve as effective alternatives for patients with stroke with *CYP2C19* LOF alleles.

In our study, the risk of major bleeding among LOF allele carriers (0.6%) was not significantly greater than that among noncarriers (0.8%) (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.53-3.13; *P* = .56). This finding aligns with the CHANCE trial results, which reported 2.3% for carriers and 2.5% for noncarriers in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group and 1.4% for carriers and 1.7% for noncarriers in the aspirin-only group.^3^ In a meta-analysis of 7 studies, bleeding occurred in 2.4% of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and 3.1% of noncarriers, without a significant difference.^12^ These findings suggest that *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers are at an increased risk of developing new stroke and composite vascular events than noncarriers, while the risk of bleeding remains similar between the 2 groups.

Reduced clopidogrel effectiveness in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke has been reported in *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers in Western countries.^17,18^ However, the effect of the *CYP2C19* genotype on the use of clopidogrel in preventing ischemic stroke remains controversial.^19,20^ Contrary to studies in Western countries, studies in Asian countries, especially in the Han Chinese population, have reported significant differences in recurrent cerebral infarction between LOF allele carriers and noncarriers.^3,4^ This may be due to the higher prevalence of LOF allele carriers in the Asian population.^18^ Among LOF allele carriers in Asian individuals, a substantial proportion makes up the intermediate metabolizer group.^4^ However, the differential impact between the poor and intermediate metabolizer groups remains unclear. In our study, the proportion of patients with the intermediate metabolizer phenotype was 47.8% (1391 of 2910), whereas it was 19% in the SPS3-GENES trials.^10^ Variations in the disease-specific proportions of intermediate and poor metabolizers may have influenced the observed differences in clinical efficacy. In addition to genotype, other factors have been reported to influence efficacy. High on-treatment platelet reactivity has been associated with clopidogrel response in multiple studies.^2,21,22^ Smoking is a recognized risk factor, with our findings indicating the smoker’s paradox in the incidence of cerebral infarction.^23,24,25,26^ Particularly in the CHANCE study, the high number of events was attributed to the large proportion of smokers within the Chinese population.^3,18^ Subgroup analysis showed that the efficacy of clopidogrel with aspirin therapy in reducing the risk of stroke recurrence is not present in *CYP2C19* LOF allele noncarriers with overweight or obesity.^27^ Moreover, age can influence clinical outcomes in older patients with ischemic stroke with *CYP2C19* variations.^28^ After acute ischemic stroke, there is evidence suggesting a potential association not only with long-term outcomes but also with acute phenomena, such as early neurologic deterioration or new ischemic lesions shown on magnetic resonance imaging,^12,29,30^ necessitating further research on personalized antiplatelet therapy. Further studies are necessary to consider these factors comprehensively.

### Limitations

Our study has some limitations. First, this study was not designed for randomization. However, it was conducted prospectively with a large cohort of patients across 37 centers in South Korea. Second, a history of cerebral infarction was recorded significantly more frequently among LOF allele carriers; however, we did not define a history of cerebral infarction and only verified it through patient history, which might have led to an overrepresentation of stroke history. Third, the follow-up duration in this study was 6 months, which limits the ability to assess the long-term effect of genotype differences; our study findings should therefore be interpreted carefully for this point. Fourth, this study was conducted exclusively in South Korea, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups. Further studies including multiple nationalities and ethnicities are necessary. Fifth, the association between other genetic genotypes potentially associated with clopidogrel metabolism was not analyzed. However, the most potent genetic determinant of the clopidogrel response is the *CYP2C19* LOF allele.^7,31^ Sixth, although our study enrolled patients with stroke symptoms within 72 hours of onset, we did not collect detailed data for each day (1, 2, or 3 days) or information on the clopidogrel loading dose. Consequently, our study could not provide information on the association of LOF alleles with clinical outcomes at each time point from day 1 to day 3 or according to clopidogrel loading.

## Conclusions

In this nonrandomized clinical trial, patients who were *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and were treated with clopidogrel had a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke than did noncarriers. Physicians may need to consider *CYP2C19* variations in patients who receive clopidogrel treatment with ischemic stroke in clinical practice.
