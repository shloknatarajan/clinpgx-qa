## Abstract

**Objective:** 
Pharmacogenomics plays an important role in drug metabolism. A stable anticoagulation is important for primary and secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). We report the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP2C9*2/*3) and vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit 1 (VKORC1) genotypes and acquired causes in maintaining stability of anticoagulation following acenocoumarin in cardioembolic stroke and CVST.

**Methods:** 
The study comprised 157 individuals with cardioembolic stroke and CVST who were on acenocoumarin. Their comorbidities, comedication, and dietary habits were noted. Prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR) were measured during follow-up, and the coagulation status was categorized as stable (>50% occasions in therapeutic range) and unstable (>50% below and above therapeutic range). Genotyping of VKORC1, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3 was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Bleeding and embolic complications were noted. The predictors of unstable INR were evaluated using multivariate analysis.

**Results:** 
INR was stable in 47.8% and unstable in 52.2% of patients. Patients with mutant genotypes required low dose of acenocoumarin. The predictors of unstable INR were metallic valve (odds ratio [OR] 4.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–13.49, P = 0.02), use of digoxin (OR 0.031, 95% CI 0.13–0.74, P = 0.09), proton pump inhibitor (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06–0.91, P = 0.037), sodium valproate (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05–0.85, P = 0.029), and CYP2C9*2 genotype (OR 5.57, 95% CI 1.19–26.06, P = 0.02).

**Conclusions:** 
Variant genotypes of VKORC1, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3 required lower dose of acenocoumarin, and CYP2C9*2 was associated with unstable INR. Comedication is a modifiable risk factor that needs attention.

## INTRODUCTION

Anticoagulants are the mainstay of primary and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism and cardioembolic stoke. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been used as oral anticoagulants (OACs) since 1940. Both warfarin and acenocoumarol have been approved for primary and secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke following cardiac valve replacement surgery, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, deep vein thrombosis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).[[1](#R1)] While VKAs are effective anticoagulants, they have limitations including narrow therapeutic range, repeated coagulation monitoring, dose adjustment, interaction with enzyme-inducing drugs, and vitamin K-rich diet. Maintaining a stable international normalized ratio (INR) is, therefore, difficult. Other important factors such as gender, age, preexisting diseases, physical activity, fasting, pregnancy, and circadian rhythm also contribute to variation in INR stability.[[2](#R2)] Genes like *CYP2C9* (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C) and *VKORC1* (vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1) also influence the dose of VKAs. Kaur *et al*.[[3](#R3)] and Rathore *et al*.[[4](#R4)] have reported the relationship of these genotypes with stability of INR in cardiac patients who have undergone valve replacement surgery. Patients from northern India required an intermediate dose of VKAs, and had an elevated risk of bleeding compared to the patients from South India. These differences may be due to the wide variability in genotyping between the North and South Indian populations.[[5](#R5)] The stability of INR may be improved and side effects may be reduced by educating the patients about diet, lifestyle, drug dosing, and regular monitoring of INR. Mutations in *VKORC* and *CYP2C9* genes may influence their anticoagulation effect. There is a paucity of studies from India about the role of pharmacogenomics and acquired factors on the stability of INR in neurologic patients who are on VKA. In this study, we report the effects of *VKORC1* and *CYP2C9* genes on the stability of INR and the thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications following VKA administration. We also report the predictors of stable INR, including pharmacogenomic and acquired factors in them.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

**Study design:** This is a hospital-based prospective cohort study conducted in the department of neurology of a tertiary care teaching and research institute in North India. This study was reviewed and ethically approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee-IEC code: 2017-144-SRF-99A. Patients or their first-degree relatives were consented for the study.

**Inclusion criteria:** Patients attending the neurology service, who were prescribed acenocoumarin for arterial or venous stroke were included. The diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by cranial computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CVST was confirmed by magnetic resonance venography. In patients with embolic stroke, the underlying cardiac etiology was established by history of cardiac valve replacement, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and Holter monitoring.

**Exclusion criteria:** Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage in the past, chronic liver or kidney disease, malignancy, intracranial vascular abnormality (cavernous angioma, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm), thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, pregnant patients, and those unwilling to participate in the study were excluded.

**Clinical evaluation:** The demographic details of the patients, including age, gender, ethnicity, education, habitat, dietary habit, especially vitamin K-rich food, weight, height, addictions, and medical history, were noted. The presence of rheumatic heart disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, deep vein thrombosis of the leg or other parts, endocrinal abnormalities, chronic joint pain, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, skin rash, or bruises was noted. Presence of anemia (hemoglobin <13 g/dl in males and <12 g/dl in females), edema, cyanosis, peripheral pulse and its rhythm, and blood pressure were noted. Neurologic examination included the level of consciousness, cranial nerve palsy, muscle power, tone, reflexes, sensations, and coordination. The height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of the patients were measured. Patients were considered hypertensive if they were on antihypertensive drug or if the systolic blood pressure was >140 mmHg or the diastolic blood pressure was >90 mmHg. They were considered diabetic if the fasting blood sugar was ≥126 mg/dl and 2-h postprandial blood sugar level was ≥200 mg/dl, or were taking hypoglycemic drugs/insulin. Patients were enquired about smoking, tobacco chewing, alcohol, and nature of food intake in the last 1 week before enrollment in the study using a food frequency questionnaire.

**Investigations:** Routine clinical and biochemical parameters were measured at the time of admission and during follow-up.

**Cranial imaging:** In the acute stage of stroke, CT scan was done using a third-generation CT scanner and/or cranial MRI using a 3-T MRI machine (Signa HDxT; GEMS, Milwaukee, WI, USA). T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted images were obtained. The location of stroke and its type were noted. In suspected CVST patients, MR venography was also done to localize the thrombus and its extension. Total blood count, hemoglobin, blood glucose and serum creatinine, protein, albumin, sodium, potassium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, lipid profile, bilirubin, and transaminases were measured. Thyroid profile was tested, and antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA, and antiphospholipid antibody (APLA) were measured in clinically suspected patients. Patients with CVST had a detailed evaluation of genetic and acquired prothrombotic risk factors as mentioned in our earlier publication.[[6](#R6)]

### Treatment

All the patients received acenocoumarin (Acitrom), started with 2 mg/day and increased by 1 mg every third day to achieve a therapeutic INR as recommended for metallic heart valve replacement and other cardiac conditions.[[7](#R7),[8](#R8)] For CVST patients, we maintained the INR at 2–3, and for those with APLA syndrome, we maintained it at 3–4.[[9](#R9),[10](#R10)] INR was measured twice weekly till two INR values were within the therapeutic range; thereafter, the patients were advised to do monthly tests. We have a specific WhatsApp group for follow-up visit of these patients, in which they uploaded their INR values. Patients with seizures were prescribed levetiracetam and/or valproate with or without clobazam.

### Coagulation measurement

Prothrombin time and INR were measured in the coagulation laboratory of our Institute, which is a laboratory accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare.

### Coagulation status

The coagulation status was categorized into two groups based on the recommended INR value for the respective diseases: optimal anticoagulation (in the therapeutic range) and suboptimal anticoagulation (below therapeutic range) or above the optimal level. The percentage of INR in therapeutic range was calculated in a given patient, and categorized as stable INR if more than 50% of INR reports were within therapeutic range, and unstable when >50% of INR reports were in sub-therapeutic range or above the therapeutic range. During follow-up, complications in the form of hemorrhage or thrombosis were noted.

### Genotyping

**DNA extraction:** Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the standard salting out method and stored at -40°C. The DNA quality and quantity were checked using NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA), and an absorbance ratio of 260/280 nm between 1.7 and 1.9 was considered good and then checked by electrophoresis on agarose gel. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a thermocycler (Veriti 96-well Thermal Cycler; Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to amplify *VKORC1* (chromosome 16, promoter, -1639 G>A, rs9923231), *CYP2C9*2* (chromosome 10, exon 3, 430 C>T, rs1799853, Arg144Cys), and *CYP2C9*3* (chromosome 10, exon 7, 1075 A>C, rs1057910, Ile359Leu). Primers used for *VKORC1* were forward 5ʹ-ATCCCTCTGGGAAGTCAGC-3ʹ and reverse 5ʹ-CACCTTCAACCTCTCCATCC-3ʹ (Eurofins Scientific). Temperature program for the reaction cycle was 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 56°C for 60 s, 72°C for 2 min, and final extension at 72°C for 6 min. Master mix of 20 μl contained template DNA (50 ng) 2 μl, 0.5 μl of deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 0.4 μl of *Taq* DNA polymerase, 1.3 μl of 1X Taq buffer, 1.0 μl each of forward and reverse primers, and 13.8 μl of Milli-Q water. The amplicon PCR products were visualized on agarose gel using electrophoresis system (Bangalore Genei). RFLP was performed using the restriction enzyme *Nci*1 (New England Biolabs) with 8 μl of amplified PCR product, 1 μl of enzyme *Nci*1*,* 1 μl of 1X enzyme buffer, and 5 μl of Milli-Q water in a reaction mixture of 15 μl at 37°C overnight to ensure complete digestion. The digested amplicon fragments were visualized under ultraviolet irradiation. The primers used for *CYP2C9*2* were: forward 5ʹ-CACTGGCTGAAAGAGCTAACAGAG-3ʹ and reverse 5ʹ-GTGATATGGAGTAGGGTCACCCAC-3ʹ, with the PCR conditions being 94°C for 4 min, 94°C for 60 s, 62°C for 45 s, 72°C for 60 s, and final extension at 72°C for 6 min. Primers used for *CYP2C9*3* were forward 5ʹ-AGGAAGAGATTGAACGTGTGA-3ʹ and reverse 5ʹ-GGCAGGCTGGTGGGGAGAAGGCCAA-3ʹ, with the PCR conditions being 94°C for 2 min, 94°C for 30 s, 57.5°C for 45 s, 72°C for 30 s, and final extension at 72°C for 6 min. Enzymes *Ava* II and *Kp*nI were used for *CYP2C9**2 and *CYP2C9**3, respectively, for RFLP. The resulting amplicon sizes for *VKORC*1-1639 G>A, *CYP2C9**2, and *CYP2C9**3 were 636, 372, and 130 bp, respectively. For *VKORC*1-1639 G>A, the digested fragments were wild type at 472 and 114 bp, heterozygous mutant at 522, 472, and 114 bp, and homozygous mutant at 522 and 114 bp. For *CYP2C9**2, nucleotide C at position 403 was replaced by T and for *CYP2C9**3, nucleotide A at position 1075 was replaced by C. For *CYP2C9**2, the wild-type amplicons were digested at 179, 119, and 74 bp and the heterozygous mutant at 253 and 119 bp. For *CYP2C9**3, the wild-type allele remained uncut at 130 bp and the heterozygous mutant digested at 130 and 104 bp.

**Statistical analysis:** For sample size calculation, the level of significance was set at 0.05. We assumed 50% population will achieve an INR in therapeutic range on treatment^.[11]^ Using the minor allele frequency data of the studied genes from HapMap and variant allele frequency from data base of SNP and previous studies on the Indian population,[[3](#R3),[4](#R4)] the sample size was calculated keeping 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.5% as the margin of error in the given incidence, and 10% patient loss at follow-up, the estimated sample size was 171. The association and relationship of the two groups of patients (stable and unstable INR) with age, gender, comorbidities, diets, drugs, and genotypes were evaluated using chi-square test for categorical variables, independent *t*-test for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann–Whitney *U* test for skewed continuous variables. The significant variables in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis to find out the independent predictors of stable INR. The requirement of OAC in different genotypes of *VKORC1*, *CYP2C9*2*, and *CYP2C9*3* was evaluated using analysis of variance. The influence of genotypes in occurrence of hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications were evaluated using chi-square test. The statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20 and GraphPad Prism version 8 software. A variable having a two-tailed *P* value of <0.05 in the statistical analysis was considered significant. The outcome of the patients was assessed at discharge and follow-up.

## RESULTS

The total number of patients screened for the study was 171. Fourteen patients were excluded. This study was conducted on 157 patients [[Figure 1](#aian.aian_886_23-F1)]. The clinical and demographic features of patients on oral acenocoumarin are given in [Table 1](#aian.aian_886_23-T1). Ninety-four (59.9%) patients had cardioembolic stroke and 63 (40.1%) had CVST.

### Stability of INR

A total of 3071 INR reports were available. INR was in the optimal range in 1509 (49.13%) times, below therapeutic range in 1020 (33.21%) times, and above therapeutic range in 542 (17.65%) times. Effective INR (>50% occasions within the therapeutic range) was reported in 75 (47.8%) patients, high INR (>50% occasions higher than the therapeutic range) in 13 (8.33%), and low INR (>50% occasions lower than the therapeutic range) in 45 (28.7%) patients. The average requirement of acenocoumarin was 2.93 mg/day (1.02–5.5 mg/day). Thirty-five (22.3%) patients had complications during the follow-up: 15 (9.55%) had thrombotic and 20 (12.73%) had hemorrhagic complications. Central nervous system complications were present in 27 (infarction in 15 and hemorrhage in 12) and systemic complication in eight (gastrointestinal bleed in three, genitourinary bleed in three, subcutaneous hematoma in two). The details are presented in [Supplementary Table 1](#aian.aian_886_23-T2). At the time of complications, INR was below therapeutic range in 10 and above therapeutic range in 4 out of the 15 patients with thrombotic complications and below therapeutic range in 1 and above therapeutic range in 12 out of the 20 patients with hemorrhagic complications (*P* = 0.001).

**Effect of genotypes:** In our study, the genotype frequency of *VKORC1* was wild type in 127 (80.9%) patients, heterozygous mutant in 22 (14%) patients, and homozygous mutant in eight (5.1%) patients. For *CYP2C9*2*, the genotype frequency was wild type in 143 (91.1%), heterozygous in 13 (8.3%), and homozygous in one (0.6%) and for *CYP2C9**3, the genotype frequency was wild type in 149 (94.9%), heterozygous in eight (5.1%), and none had homozygous variant. Considering all the three genes, 122 (77.7%) patients had wild type, two (1.3%) patients had all heterozygous mutant, four (2.5%) patients had all homozygous mutant, 22 (14%) patients had only one heterozygous mutant, and four (2.5%) patients had only one homozygous mutant. In our study, we compared the patient’s genotype frequencies with the control subject frequency reported by Rathore *et al*.,[[12](#R12)] who conducted the study in the same institute and included a similar ethnic population. The Rathore group studied 102 individuals from states in northern India. The genotype frequency pattern observed in the patients of our present study was not significantly different from that reported in the control subjects from our institute (*P* = 0.19) [[Table 2](#aian.aian_886_23-T3)] . The requirement of OACs was lower in patients with mutant genotype of *VKORC1*, *CYP2C9*2*, and *CYP2C9*3* genes [[Figure 2](#aian.aian_886_23-F2)], and *CYP2C9*2* gene was related to unstable INR. The genetic load of mutation was not associated with stable and unstable INR (3.28 ± 0.74 vs. 3.49 ± 0.92, *P* = 0.07) [[Table 3](#aian.aian_886_23-T4)]. The genetic load was calculated by giving an individual score of 1 to wild type, 2 to heterozygous, and 3 to homozygous mutation for the three genes. Bleeding and thrombotic complications were not related to genetic load of mutation (3.85 ± 1.18 vs. 3.53 ± 0.99, *P* = 0.33).

**Predictors of effective INR:** On univariate analysis, unstable INR was related to metallic valve replacement (30.67% vs. 41.46%, *P* = 0.007), comedication with digoxin (12% vs. 35.36%, *P* = 0.001), proton pump inhibitor (4% vs. 13.41%, *P* = 0.05), sodium valproate (4% vs. 14.63%, *P* = 0.02), and statin (9.33% vs. 2.43%, *P* = 0.001). The demographic and dietary factors were not related to stability of INR [[Table 4](#aian.aian_886_23-T5)]. The biochemical parameters such as liver and kidney function tests, complete hemogram, serum albumin and calcium were not related to the stability of INR [[Supplementary Table 2](#aian.aian_886_23-T6)]. Among genotypes, *CYP2C9*2* was related to unstable INR and mutation load was not associated with stability (*P* = 0.07). On multivariate analysis, adjusting the variables found to be significant in univariate analysis, the best set of predictors of unstable INR included metallic valve (odds ratio [OR] 4.07, 95% CI 1.23–13.49, *P* = 0.02), use of digoxin (OR 0.031, 95% CI 0.13–0.74, *P* = 0.09), proton pump inhibitor (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06–0.91, *P* = 0.037), sodium valproate (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05–0.85, *P* = 0.029), and *CYP2C9*2* genotype (OR 5.57, 95%, CI 1.19–26.06, *P* = 0.02) [[Table 5](#aian.aian_886_23-T7)].

## DISCUSSION

In the present study, patients with mutant alleles of *VKORC1* and *CYP2C9* genotypes required lower dose of acenocoumarin compared to those having wild type. On univariate analysis, unstable INR was associated with metallic valve replacement, cardioembolic stoke, *CYP2C9*2* mutation, and comedication with digoxin, proton pump inhibitors, sodium valproate, and statins; but on multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of unstable INR were metallic valve, digoxin, proton pump inhibitor, and sodium valproate. In the data available on PharmGKB,[[13](#R13)] variant annotations report the association between mutations of studied genes and drug dosing. Single-nucleotide polymorphism in *VKORC1*, *CYP2C9*2*, and *CYP2C9*3* results in a decreased transcription of the gene and has been strongly associated with dose requirement. Mutant genotypes were also found to be associated with increased risk of complications on acenocoumarol treatment due to the instability of INR. Although there are studies evaluating the effects of various cofactors, including genetic, on the stability of INR,[[14](#R14),[15](#R15)] there is paucity of studies on North Indian stroke patients. Vegetarianism is commonly practiced by the Hindu community, and they consume Vitamin K-rich vegetables and fruits. Vitamin K intake is inversely associated with the level of anticoagulation, and even brief period of increased or decreased vitamin K intake has a statistically significant effect on coagulation.[[16](#R16)] Hillman *et al*.[[15](#R15)] reported the relationship of OAC dose with genotype, age, gender, BMI, comedication, and comorbidity in a retrospective study, in which genotype accounted for 19.8%, age 14.6%, BMI 7.5%, gender 4.7%, and valve replacement 5.4% with OAC dose variability. Another study has reported the effect of age and *CYP2C9* polymorphism (*r* = 0.45, *P* < 0.005) on OAC dose in long-term therapy for stable anticoagulation.[[17](#R17)] Apostolakis *et al*.[[18](#R18)] defined the external factor responsible using a scoring system to adjust the factors with INR control and demonstrated that the scoring had a good difference in the performance between internal and external factors (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.79 vs. OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.57–0.82). The requirement of lower dose of OAC in patients with variant genotypes may be due to reduced production of vitamin K due to mutation in *VKORC1* gene and impaired metabolism due to mutation in *CYP2C9* gene. *VKORC1* is acenocoumarin’s main target that influences and predicts dose requirement. Carriers of a homozygous or heterozygous variant allele A were found to require 30% less OAC dose.[[19](#R19)] *CYP2C9* gene is primarily responsible for the oxidative metabolism of acenocoumarins and is responsible for reduction in its enzymatic activity. Mutations in *CYP2C9* gene account for about 10% variance in acenocoumarin dose requirement, while other environmental, nonhereditary clinical factors are responsible for about 15%–20% variance in dose requirement. Patients can be classified in terms of drug response as rapid, intermediate, and slow metabolizers of the drug in accordance with the genotype. Some earlier studies have reported the relationship of variant alleles with OAC dosing and have suggested genotype as a marker of acenocoumarol dosing.[[20](#R20)] Other studies did not find the association of variant alleles with dosing and thrombotic and bleeding complications of OAC.[[21](#R21)] In our study, *VKORC1*, *CYP2C9*2*, and *CYP2C9*3* were found to have an association with the dose of OAC. However, the variant genotypes, allele frequency, and genetic load did not have an association with stable INR and complications, either thrombotic or hemorrhagic. This may be due to comedication, comorbidities, and vitamin K-rich diet. High intake of vitamin K-rich diet makes more vitamin K, which would need vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) and CYP2C9 enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system for degradation and metabolism of vitamin K. Inability to do these functions may result in low INR and thrombotic event, and the reverse situation may result in hemorrhagic complications. Our patients were advised dietary restriction, which may be the reason for a lack of relationship of diet with stability of INR and complications. We also excluded patients with liver dysfunction, and there was no relationship of liver function test, albumin, and calcium with stability of INR and complications. Comedication with digoxin, statin, and sodium valproate had significant role in instability of INR. Statin was prescribed to nine patients only; seven had stable and two had unstable INR. The effect of statin could not be reliably assessed in our study because of smaller sample size requiring statins. In our cohort, 38 (24.2%) patients received digoxin: 21 (55.2%) for rheumatic heart disease, seven (18.4%) in cardiomyopathy, nine (23.6%) in prosthetic valve, and one (2.3%) for myocardial infarction. Out of these, 29 patients had unstable INR. In our study, seizure was present in 37 (58.7%) CVST and 23 (24.4%) cardioembolic stroke patients. The occurrence of seizures in CVST has been reported to be 25.4%–46.6% of patients.[[22](#R22)] These patients need antiepileptic drugs. We usually avoided first-generation antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, phenobarbitone, carbamazepine, and sodium valproate); instead, we preferred levetiracetam and clobazam. Also, 9.6% of our patients received sodium valproate and of them, 14.6% had unstable INR and 4.0% had stable INR. Digoxin, statin, and valproate use hepatic enzymes of P450 system, and hence may result in unstable INR. Earlier studies also have reported similar effect of these drugs on INR values.[[23](#R23)] The most significant predictor of unstable INR was metallic valve replacement. In developing countries, rheumatic heart disease is still prevalent, and a large proportion of cardiac surgery in Southeast Asia consists of valve replacement surgery.[[24](#R24),[25](#R25)] These patients are younger than those with degenerative heart disease. Metallic valve is used in them because of its durability and low cost compared to tissue valve, and they need lifelong VKA.[[26](#R26)] Patients with CVST had more stable INR and did not have thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. None of the CVST patients received statins, digoxin, or first-generation antiepileptic drugs. In our earlier studies on CVST, thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications were not found within 6 months of follow-up.[[27](#R27)] Higher frequency of thrombotic and bleeding complications on treatment with acenocoumarin or warfarin has been reported in Asian patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease or with metallic valve. An Asian study on patients with metallic heart valve on OAC has reported thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in 14.05% and 23.7% of patients, respectively.[[28](#R28)] A study on an Indian population has reported similar frequencies of *VKORC1*-1639G >A, *CYP2C9*2*, and *CYP2C9*3* genetic variants.[[12](#R12)] It was shown in comparative studies that the allele and genotype frequency of *VKORC1* in South Indian population and North Indian population did not have any significant difference and *CYP2C9*2* allele frequency in North India, West India, and South India was also similar, except in a study from Hyderabad which showed a slightly higher frequency, which may be due to the smaller sample size. *CYP2C9*3* allele frequency in the North Indian population ranged from 0.039 to 0.17; in the Western Indian population, the frequency ranged from 0.122 to 0.129; and in the South Indian population, it was 0.067–0.09.[[29](#R29),[30](#R30)] The variation in genotype frequencies may be due to ethnic differences. India is a multicultural and multiethnic country; therefore, genetic variation is not uncommon. Kaur *et al*.[[3](#R3)] reported unstable INR in 30%–34% of metallic valve–replaced patients, and no significant difference in patients with wild or variant allele was found. Singh *et al*.[[31](#R31)] reported anticoagulation-related hemorrhagic events in 4.5% of patients per year and thromboembolic events in 4.8% of patients per year with prosthetic valve. In the present study also, hemorrhagic complication was associated with high INR and thrombotic complication was associated with low INR. A recent randomized controlled trial has shown no additional benefit if INR is maintained between 2 and 3 versus 3 and 4.[[9](#R9)] The efficacy is better with the use of additional antiplatelet.[[10](#R10)] We have not used antiplatelet in our patients with APLA who had cerebral venous thrombosis; therefore, the target INR was kept between 3 and 4.

### Limitations

OAC dose requirement may be influenced by other genes like *CYP4F2* and *GGCX*, whose role was not studied here. This study is based on selected patients from a single center; therefore, the results cannot be extrapolated to the community in general.

## CONCLUSIONS

Patients with mutant genotype of *VKORC1*, *CYP2C9*2*, and *CYP2C9*3* genes were found to require low doses of acenocoumarin, although this did not determine the INR stability and complications if any. Metallic valve replacement and comedication with digoxin, statin, and sodium valproate were independent predictors of instability of INR in patients treated with acenocoumarin. Attention to comedication and closer monitoring of these patients may be required.
