## Abstract

Background: Haloperidol is commonly prescribed to patients with alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (AIPD). Notably however, individuals differ extensively with regards to therapeutic response and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Previous studies have shown that haloperidol biotransformation is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6. Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the use of pharmacogenetic (CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism) and pharmacometabolomic biomarkers to predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates. Material and Methods: The study enrolled 150 patients with AIPD. Therapy included haloperidol in a daily dose of 5 to 10 mg/day by injections for 5 days. Efficacy and safety of treatment were evaluated using the validated psychometric scales PANSS, UKU, and SAS. Results: No association of the urinary 6-НО-ТНВС/pinoline ratio values which could be evidence of the CYP2D6 activity level with both the efficacy and safety rates of haloperidol was demonstrated. However, a statistically significant association between haloperidol safety profile and CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism was demonstrated (P < .001). Conclusion: To predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates, utilization of pharmacogenetic testing that defines CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism is found preferable over the use of the pharmacometabolomic marker in a clinical setting.

## Introduction

Alcohol-induced Psychotic Disorder (AIPD), or psychotic disorder due to the use of alcohol, is a complication of alcohol abuse which is characterized by acute onset of auditory hallucinations and delusions in a clear consciousness, and associated with a history of heavy drinking.^ 1 ^ AIPD is considered an underdiagnosed condition with prevalence estimates in patients with alcohol addiction varying from 0.4% to 12%.^2,3^ The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, and the disorder needs to be differentiated from alcohol withdrawal delirium and schizophrenia. In contrast to delirium tremens, the preceding drinking spree can be variable, but lasting no longer than 1 week.^ 4 ^

Antipsychotic treatment remains the preferred therapy for AIPD. Inpatient treatment is recommended for the management of AIPD, as it often involves targeting both psychosis and other co-occurring disorders. While the efficacy of different antipsychotic treatments in AIPD has not yet been compared in controlled studies, haloperidol administered in doses of 5 to 10 mg/day has been associated with favorable outcomes.^1,5^

Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation antipsychotic and one of the most applicable neuroleptics worldwide.^ 6 ^ It predominantly exerts is action through strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Haloperidol is thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine.^ 7 ^ However, haloperidol use is associated with adverse reactions of drug-induced extrapyramidal syndrome due to the striatal D2 receptor blockade. Major extrapyramidal adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of haloperidol include Parkinsonian symptoms, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and dystonia.^ 8 ^ It can also block noradrenergic, cholinergic, and histaminergic signaling which is associated with various ADRs.^ 9 ^

Haloperidol undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in urine.^ 10 ^ The genetically polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 contributes to the biotransformation of haloperidol. Up to date, >1200 mostly rare variations in the *CYP2D6* locus have been described^ 11 ^ of which 50 to 100 have been functionally characterized.^12,13^ A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the *CYP2D6* gene results in a functionally deficient variant of the enzyme (the so-called CYP2D6*4 isoform). Currently, it is believed that this is a frequent *CYP2D6* variant leading to a deficiency in enzyme activity and it is believed to result in a poor metabolizer status.^ 14 ^

Categorization of the *CYP2D6* metabolizer status is based on an assessment of CYP2D6 activity or can be inferred from genetic data. Individuals are categorized into 4 phenotype groups: poor metabolizers (PMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), normal metabolizers (NMs), and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs).^15,16^ Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for drugs affected by genetic variations use these categories to provide clinicians with recommendations for adjusting doses or switching medications that are expected to cause ADRs in patients with certain CYP2D6 metabolizer status.^ 17 ^

In 2009, Jiang et al revealed that pinoline is largely O-demethylated by CYP2D6 to 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline. Their findings suggest that pinoline, at a proper concentration, may be a good probe to evaluate CYP2D6 activity.^ 18 ^

The objective of our study was to investigate the use of pharmacogenetic (CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism) and pharmacometabolomic biomarkers to predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates.

## Material and Methods

The study enrolled 150 hospitalized male patients (average age 42.3 ± 15.2 years) diagnosed with an AIPD with predominant hallucinations (typically auditory). Haloperidol in injections at a dose of 5 to 10 mg/day was prescribed to this cohort of patients for 5 days for the treatment of acute hallucinatory symptoms. In addition to haloperidol, all patients received minimal standard therapy for 5 days, which included infusions and ion-containing solutions, as well as vitamins (see [Table 1](#table1-00185787231155842)). Prescriptions were made in accordance with the national clinical guidelines for the therapy of AIPD.

### Table 1.

| Medications | Average daily dose |
| --- | --- |
| Sodium chloride solution 0.9% + potassium chloride 10% + magnesium sulfate 25% | 800 mL |
| Thiamine hydrochloride solution 5% | 100 mg |
| Pyridoxine hydrochloride solution 5% | 100 mg |

Table 1 Caption: Minimal Standard Therapy.

The inclusion criterion was the diagnosis of AIPD with predominant hallucinations (F10.52, according to ICD-10). Exclusion criteria were creatinine clearance values <50 mL/min, creatinine concentration in plasma >1.5 mg/dL (133 mmol/L), bodyweight less than 60 kg or greater than 100 kg, age of 75 years or more, presence of any other psychotropic medications in the treatment regimen, presence of chronic psychotic disorders, and any contraindications for haloperidol use.

Each patient signed an informed consent to voluntarily participate in the study. The study was approved by the local ethical committee of the Russian Medical Academy of Continuing Professional Education of the Ministry of Health of Russia (Protocol No. 14 of October 27, 2020).

The design of the studies was chosen retrospective, which implies a comparison of the results of evaluating the effectiveness and safety of therapy in various carriers based on the results of the study.

For genotyping, venous blood samples were collected into VACUETTE (Greiner Bio-One, Austria) vacuum tubes on day 6 of haloperidol therapy. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) *rs3892097* (CYP2D6*4) was analyzed by real-time PCR using “Dtlite” DNA amplifiers (DNA Technology, Moscow, Russia) on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time System with CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and the “SNP-screen” sets (Syntol, Moscow, Russia). In every set, 2 allele-specific hybridizations were used, which allowed simultaneous determination of both alleles of the respective SNP.

To evaluate CYP2D6 enzymatic activity, we determined the urinary concentration of the endogenous substrate of the enzyme and its metabolite, 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (6-HO-THBC) to pinoline ratio using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Biomaterial collection was performed on days 1 and 6 of treatment after haloperidol administration.

To assess haloperidol efficacy, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used.^ 19 ^ The safety profile was evaluated using the UKU^ 20 ^ and SAS^ 21 ^ scales. Patients were examined on days 1 and 6 of haloperidol therapy.

Statistical analysis was performed in Statsoft Statistica v. 10.0 (Dell Statistica, Tulsa, OK, USA). The normality of sample distribution was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test and was taken into account for selecting parametric or non-parametric tests. The differences were considered statistically significant at *Р* < .05 (power above 80%). Two samples of continuous independent data were compared using the Mann-Whitney *U*-tests with further correction of the obtained *P*-value using the Benjamin-Hochberg test, due to the multiple comparison procedure. Research data are presented in the form of the median and interquartile range (Me [Q1; Q3]).

## Results

### The Use of Pharmacogenetic Testing to Predict Haloperidol Efficacy and Safety

Of the 150 patients, 48 (32%) were heterozygous for CYP2D6*4, while the remaining 102 individuals (68%) did not carry the CYP2D6*4 allele. There were no patients homozygous for CYP2D6*4 revealed in the study cohort.

The results of data analysis performed for psychometric assessments (PANSS) and side-effect rating scales (UKU and SAS) scores in patients carrying different genotypes are provided in [Table 2](#table2-00185787231155842) and [Figure 1](#fig1-00185787231155842).

### Table 2.

Data from the psychometric assessments and side-effect rating scales in patients with different genotypes on day 6 of the study. Note. PANSS = Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; SAS = Simpson-Angus Scale; UKU = Ugvald for Kliniske Undersgelser Side Effect Rating Scale.

We found no statistically significant differences in haloperidol efficacy rates in patients with AIPD carrying different CYP2D6*4 genotypes. Meanwhile, a statistically significant difference in safety rates was found, suggesting that reduced *CYP2D6* gene expression decreases haloperidol safety ([Table 3](#table3-00185787231155842)).

| p | >0.9 | 0.824 |

Next, we analyzed whether CYP2D6 activity assessed using the pharmacometabolomic biomarker could predict haloperidol response rates and the risk of ADRs.

### The Use of Pharmacometabolomic Biomarker to Predict Haloperidol Efficacy and Safety

To evaluate whether pharmacometabolomic biomarker would better predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates, we analyzed patient phenotypes using the 6-НО-ТНВС/pinoline metabolic ratio ([Table 3](#table3-00185787231155842)).

Phenotyping results revealed no statistical significance for the 6-НО-ТНВС/pinoline ratio values in patients with different genotypes ([Figure 2](#fig2-00185787231155842)). Also, we found no correlations between the phenotyping results and the UKU and SAS scale scores, indicating that the use of pharmacometabolomic biomarker does not allow predicting haloperidol safety ([Figure 3A](#fig3-00185787231155842) and [B](#fig3-00185787231155842)).

## Discussion

The findings of our study suggest that pharmacogenetic testing for CYP2D6 is a sufficient marker to predict haloperidol safety in AIPD patients. Notably, our results demonstrate that heterozygosity for CYP2D6*4 (revealed in 32% of the study population) affects the safety profile of haloperidol in patients with AIPD, which is estimated to be a good approximation for other European populations.^ 21 ^ Thus, our results indicate that CYP2D6*4 is a strong determinant of haloperidol safety.

Non-carriers demonstrated lower increase in both SAS and UKU scale scores from days 1 to 6 of the study in comparison with those who carried CYP2D6*4, indicative of increased risk of ADRs in patients carrying the *GA* genotype. These findings are consistent with the literature that reported reduced safety in haloperidol-treated patients with reduced numbers of functional *CYP2D6* alleles.^ 22 ^ Conversely, although we did not evaluate the steady-state concentration of haloperidol, our findings do not support pharmacometabolomic screening to predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates.

A number of important limitations need to be considered. First, all patients of the study cohort were male, which might limit the transferability of our findings across sexes. Second, we evaluated only a single genetic polymorphism CYP2D6*4 and did not analyze other functionally relevant *CYP2D6* alleles, such as CYP2D6*3, **5*, **6*, or **41*. Third, genotyping performed in a cohort of 150 individuals revealed no homozygous CYP2D6*4 carriers. Fourth, plasma concentrations of haloperidol should be measured to better understand the association between the drug level, genotype, *in vivo* phenotype and ADRs to facilitate the development of an algorithm for genotype-based haloperidol dosing.

## Conclusion

To predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates, utilization of pharmacogenetic testing that defines CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism is found preferable over the use of the pharmacometabolomic marker in a clinical setting.
