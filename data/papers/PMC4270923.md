## Abstract

**Background:** 
We hypothesized that genetic variations in the adrenergic signaling pathway and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme are associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and were treated with perioperative beta-blocker (BB).

**Methods and Results:** 
Two cohorts of patients who underwent CABG surgery and received perioperative BBs at Duke University Medical Center were studied. In a discovery cohort of 563 individuals from the Perioperative Genetics and Safety Outcomes Study (PEGASUS), using a covariate adjusted logistic regression analysis, we tested 492 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 candidate genes of the adrenergic signaling pathway and CYP2D6 for association with postoperative AF- despite perioperative BB therapy. SNPs meeting a false discovery rate ≤ 0.20 (P<0.002) were then tested in the replication cohort of 245 individuals from the CATHeterization GENetics (CATHGEN) biorepository. Of the 492 SNPs examined, 4 intronic SNPs of the G protein-coupled kinase 5 (GRK5) gene were significantly associated with postoperative AF- despite perioperative BB therapy in the discovery cohort with additive odds ratios between 1.72 and 2.75 (P=4.78×10-5 to 0.0015). Three of these SNPs met nominal significance levels in the replication cohort with odds ratios between 2.07 and 2.60 (P=0.007-0.016). However, meta-analysis of the two datasets cohorts suggested strong association with postoperative AF despite perioperative BB therapy in all 4 SNPs (meta-P-values from 1.66 × 10-6 to 3.39 × 10-5).

**Conclusions:** 
In patients undergoing CABG surgery, genetic variation in GRK5 is associated with postoperative AF despite perioperative BB therapy.

Three of these SNPs met nominal significance levels in the replication cohort with odds ratios between 2.07 and 2.60 (P=0.007-0.016). However, meta-analysis of the two datasets cohorts suggested strong association with postoperative AF despite perioperative BB therapy in all 4 SNPs (meta-P-values from 1.66 × 10^-6^ to 3.39 × 10^-5^).

## Introduction

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common complication following coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), occurring in 25% to 40% of patients.^1^ Studies have indicated that postoperative AF is associated with an increased incidence of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency, and neurological events, resulting in longer hospital stays and increased total cost of surgery.^1, 2^ The additional healthcare costs related to postoperative AF exceed $10,000 per patient, translating to more than $1 billion each year in the United States alone.

Sympathetic activation or an exaggerated response to adrenergic stimulation is an important trigger for postoperative AF.^3^ Beta-blockers (BBs) are a mainstay in the prevention and treatment of postoperative AF^4^; however, approximately 20% of patients undergoing CABG develop postoperative AF despite BB use.^4, 5^ The genes coding for β-adrenergic receptors and hepatic metabolism of several BBs are highly polymorphic.^6, 7^ Potentially relevant functional polymorphisms that affect pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic responses of BBs have been identified in adrenergic receptor and signaling/regulatory proteins^3, 8^ and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme.^9^ These polymorphisms impact the risk for cardiovascular complications during BB therapy.^9, 10^ However, their pharmacogenomic effects on the incidence of postoperative AF in patients undergoing CABG surgery and receiving perioperative BB treatment remains unknown. Therefore, we examined genetic variations in the adrenergic signaling pathway and in BB biotransformation by CYP2D6 for association with new-onset postoperative AF in the setting of CABG surgery.

## Methods

The study design and reporting of the results follows the recommendations of “Strengthening the Reporting of Genetic Association Studies” (STREGA).^11^

## Study Design and Description of Study Populations

Each of the parent studies in our investigation was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Duke University Medical Center, and all subjects provided written informed consent.

We conducted a case-cohort study in 960 patients of self-reported European ancestry who participated in the Perioperative Genetics and Safety Outcomes Study (PEGASUS), and who underwent isolated CABG surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) between 1997 and 2006.^12^ For patients who had more than one cardiac surgery during that period, only data from the first surgery were included. Patients who received perioperative BB therapy met our eligibility criteria. Case subjects were patients who developed new-onset postoperative AF, while patients who did not develop new-onset postoperative AF served as controls. Perioperative BB therapy was defined as acute or chronic preoperative BB treatment (regardless of the type of BB) and postoperative BB treatment administered before new onset of postoperative AF. Patients with a history of preoperative AF, and patients who received no perioperative BB treatment before new-onset postoperative AF were identified by individual chart and 12-lead electrocardiogram reviews, and excluded. Of the original 960 patients, 563 met our criteria for case or control subjects and comprised the discovery cohort for our study.

We then selected patients from the CATHeterization GENetics (CATHGEN) study^13^ who underwent cardiac catheterization between 2001 and 2010 for evaluation of ischemic heart disease. From this group,^14, 15^ 475 individuals of self-reported European ancestry subsequently underwent CABG surgery with CPB between 2006 and 2010, and also had available genotype data. Of these, 245 patients met our study eligibility criteria, as described above, and comprised the replication cohort for our study.

Intraoperative anesthetic, perfusion, and cardioprotective management was standardized. General anesthesia was maintained with a combination of fentanyl and isoflurane. Perfusion support consisted of nonpulsatile CPB (30°C- 32°C), crystalloid prime, pump flow rates >2.4 L/min per m^2^, cold blood cardioplegia, α-stat blood gas management, activated clotting times >450 seconds maintained with heparin, ε-aminocaproic acid infusion administered routinely, and serial hematocrits maintained at >0.18.

## Data Collection and End-point Definition

Patient demographics, preoperative and procedural factors, and perioperative medication use, which are components^1^ of the postoperative AF Risk Index ([Supplemental Table 1](#SD2)) were recorded and collated, using the Duke Information System for Cardiovascular Care- an integral part of the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease. The postoperative AF Risk Index is a predictor of postoperative AF for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.^1, 16^ Diagnosis of new-onset postoperative AF was based on postoperative electrocardiogram or rhythm strip or documented by at least 2 of the following: progress notes, nursing notes, discharge summary, or change in medication.^1^

## Candidate Gene and Marker Selection

Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using standard procedures. Genotyping in the PEGASUS cohort (discovery samples) was performed on the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip and in the CATHGEN (replication samples) cohort on Illumina OMNI1-Quad BeadChip at the Duke Genomic Analysis Facility. The Illumina raw data were analyzed using the Illumina GenomeStudio and a low GenCall score cutoff of 0.15. Each intensity plot was then examined with manual curation of genotype calls.^12^ Since single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays used in both cohorts were different, not all markers identified in the discovery cohort were present on Illumina OMNI1-Quad BeadChip used in the CATHGEN cohort. Therefore, we included imputed SNPs derived from IMPUTE2^17^ using 1000 genome as the reference panel in CATHGEN cohort to match selected candidate SNPs between the two datasets. We excluded markers with MAF <0.05 derived from all samples of PEGASUS. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was computed for the PEGASUS and CATHGEN controls, respectively, using PLINK 1.07 software.^18^ Markers that deviated from HWE, based on Bonferroni correction (0.05/number of markers) were also excluded.

Based on the current understanding of the pharmacogenetic effects of adrenergic receptor signaling and biotransformation of BBs,^8, 9, 19^ a set of 10 candidate genes with a potential for modulating the effectiveness of BB therapy ([Supplemental Table 2](#SD2)) was selected, representing adrenergic receptor subtypes, intracellular secondary messenger signaling, and hepatic metabolism of BBs by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6).^8, 9, 19-21^ We selected SNPs within these candidate genes and 50 kbp flanking regions outside of the gene boundary that met the quality control criteria in the discovery dataset as described above. However, there were no SNPs available in *CYP2D6* due to low genotyping quality. We proceeded with imputation for *CYP2D6* in the discovery dataset using IMPUTE2^17^ and 1000 genome as the reference panel. For this imputation, we required that the probability of the best-imputed genotype be greater than 90%. A list of genotyped candidate gene polymorphisms studied is provided in [Supplemental Table 3](#SD2).

## Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics of clinical variables are presented as frequency and percentage for categorical variables and mean ± SD or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables. Univariable logistic regression analysis was performed to test the differences in demographic and clinical and procedural characteristics between case and control subjects. P-values (P) were derived from 2-sided Wald tests. Analyses of clinical variables were conducted using SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

All association analyses below were performed using PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/). For each of the SNPs, allelic associations with postoperative AF were assessed using logistic regression analyses adjusted for the postoperative AF Risk Index. These association tests, including those for imputed genotypes, were performed assuming an additive inheritance model (homozygote major allele vs heterozygote vs homozygote minor allele). To account for multiple comparisons in the discovery cohort, a false discovery rate was computed for all identified SNPs using the q-value^22^ and computed using the QVALUE program (http://genomics.princeton.edu/storeylab/qvalue/). The top candidate SNPs were chosen based on a q-value < 20% for replication in the CATHGEN cohort. The same logistic regression model adjusted for the postoperative AF Risk Index was applied in the replication dataset.

To assess the overall effect of candidate SNPs, we then conducted a meta-analysis using the weighted Z-score meta-analysis as implemented in METAL (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/metal). For the final candidate gene(s) prioritized by meta-analysis P-values, we also performed finemapping to increase the coverage using all imputed markers within the gene or region in the discovery dataset. Given that genetic effect size is often small, one common concern in a genetic association study is the impact of the winner's curse- a phenomenon of overestimated effect size for the significant markers in the discovery dataset due to ascertainment bias, that may lead to underpowered follow-up studies and failure to replicate the original findings.^23^ Therefore, we evaluated the potential effect of winner's curse by applying the ascertainment-corrected maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) to assess effect sizes of the final significant markers (http://csg.sph.umich.edu/boehnke/winner/).^23^

In addition, we also performed 2-marker haplotype association tests by sliding windows with the step size of one marker to scan through all markers within each gene in the discovery cohort using the standard Expectation-Maximization (E-M) algorithm implemented in PLINK to infer haplotypes. Haplotype association tests were also based on logistic regression models with adjustment for the postoperative AF Risk Index. Pairs of markers with the highest level of association were then tested in the replication dataset.

## Results

Demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients in the discovery and replication cohorts stratified according to the actual documented presence or absence of postoperative AF are shown in [Table 1](#T1). The mean age of the discovery cohort was 62.5 ± 10.5 years; 422 (75%) of the subjects were male; and the median (IQR) postoperative AF risk score was 11 (5-17). Of the 563 patients in this cohort, 111 (19.7%) developed postoperative AF. These case subjects had a significantly higher median postoperative AF risk score compared to controls without postoperative AF (13 [7-23] vs 11 [5-17]; OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.04-1.09; P < 0.0001). A total of 561 SNPs (524 genotyped and 37 imputed) were initially available. None of the 561 candidate SNPs deviated from HWE (P < 8.9x10^-5^, based on Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 561 markers), but 51 genotyped and 18 imputed SNPs were excluded due to MAF < 0.05. Therefore, 492 SNPs were analyzed in the discovery dataset as shown in [Supplemental Table 3](#SD2). A total of 4 SNPs, all within the *GRK5* gene, met our prespecified significance threshold of *q*-value ≤ 0.20 (P ranges from 4.78 x 10^-5^ to 0.0015) in the discovery cohort and were selected for follow-up analysis in the replication dataset ([Table 2](#T2)). The genotype frequencies for these 4 SNPs in both cohorts are summarized in [Supplemental Table 4](#SD2). The risk allele “A” of *rs3740563* was the most statistically significant SNP associated with an increased risk for postoperative AF despite perioperative BB prophylaxis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69, 4.48; P = 4.78*10^-5^). The other 3 SNPs also showed increased risk for postoperative AF despite perioperative BB therapy ([Table 2](#T2)).

As for the well-known candidate gene, *CYP2D6*, 19 imputed SNPs with MAF ≥ 0.05 were analyzed ([Supplemental Table 3](#SD2)). Five SNPs reached nominal significance (P-values ranging from 0.032 to 0.046), which included rs16947, a missense variant (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.00-1.97; P = 0.047). However, none of these markers remained statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing.

In the replication cohort (n = 245), postoperative AF was observed in 42 (17.1%) patients. The mean age of this cohort was 61.0 ± 10.7 years; 156 (63.7%) of the patients were male; and the median (IQR) postoperative AF risk score was 6 (1-12). Similar to the discovery cohort, patients with postoperative AF had a significantly higher mean postoperative AF risk score compared to patients without postoperative AF (11.5 [6-18] vs 6 [0-12]; OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04-1.13; P = 0.0001). Of the 4 SNPs analyzed in the replication cohort, 3 SNPs (rs10787959, rs3740563, and rs11198893), all in the intragenic region of *GRK5*, remained significantly associated with postoperative AF despite perioperative BB use (based on the Bonferroni corrected threshold of four SNP tested, P-values ranging from 0.007 to 0.016, [Table 2](#T2)). The meta-analysis of both datasets by METAL showed rs3740563 as the most significant SNP associated with postoperative AF despite perioperative BB prophylaxis (meta P = 1.66 × 10^-6^) with the same direction of effect in both discovery and replication datasets ([Table 2](#T2)). Finally, to assess the impact of ascertainment bias (winner's curse) on our findings, we compared the ORs of our most significant marker (rs3740563) derived from MLE without and with ascertainment correction. The difference between un-corrected MLE (naïve MLE) and corrected was minimal in the discovery (uncorrected OR, 2.19 versus ascertainment-corrected OR, 2.28) and replication (uncorrected OR, 2.34 versus ascertainment-corrected OR, 2.37) datasets.

We further finemapped *GRK5* in the discovery cohort using all qualified imputed markers (MAF ≥ 0.05; 389 markers) within the gene. The average distance between markers is 588.17 base-pairs (SD = 675.54 bp). [Figure 1](#F1) depicts all genotyped and imputed markers investigated in this gene. The rs3740563 remained the most significant marker ([Supplemental Table 5](#SD2)). In [Figure 2](#F2), the linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the markers in *GRK5* shows that the most significant SNP, rs3740563, is in strong LD with the adjacent SNP, rs4752292 (r^2^ = 0.69). Two-marker haplotype association tests across the *GRK5* region revealed an interesting region: rs11198878-rs3740563-rs4752292 ([Figure 3](#F3)). In this region, despite perioperative BB therapy, association with increased risk for postoperative AF was most significant in the haplotype A-A of rs3740563-rs4752292 (OR = 2.75; 95% CI: 1.69-4.48; P = 0.000048). In the discovery cohort, the frequency of this haplotype (A-A) was estimated to be 7.7% in controls and 15.8% in cases. In the replication cohort, the estimated frequency was 8.5% in controls and 17.9% in cases, and remained nominally significant with an increased risk for postoperative AF (OR = 2.60; 95% CI: 2.35-2.85; P = 0.011; [Figure 3](#F3) and [Supplemental Table 6](#SD2)).

## Discussion

Our study is the first to demonstrate that genetic variation in the *GRK5* gene is associated with postoperative AF in patients who undergo CABG surgery and were treated with perioperative BBs. Our findings suggest an independent association even after adjusting for clinical and procedural variables known to predict an increased risk for postoperative AF. Thus, testing for these genetic markers could improve risk stratification and potentially personalize therapy for preventing postoperative AF.

*GRK5* encodes the protein G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5), which is abundantly expressed in the normal human heart. Gold et al found that GRK5 regulates cardiac inotropic and chronotropic actions of catecholamines, which bind and activate β-adrenergic receptors.^24^ GRK5 also mediates β1-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment, resulting in uncoupling from G proteins.^25^ Canonically, GRK5 desensitizes the β-adrenergic receptors via agonist-dependent phosphorylation. Thus, GRK5 potentially acts as a physiological regulator of β-adrenergic receptor activity.

In addition, a nuclear localization sequence enables translocation of GRK5 to the nucleus, suggesting that this kinase may participate in nuclear functions such as DNA duplication or transcription.^26^ Indeed, GRK5 inhibits nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. NF-κB is a key transcription regulator in ischemia-reperfusion injury,^27^ and its inhibition may provide protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is a hallmark of CABG surgery.^28^ Gao and Dudley showed that NF-κB also mediates transcriptional changes seen in AF.^29^ However, we do not yet know how genetic variants in *GRK5* may influence DNA transcription and mitigate responses to BB therapy or increase the risk for postoperative AF after cardiac surgery.

Although the potential mechanism of action of the intronic *GRK5* SNPs identified in our study is unknown, it may be mediated through modulation of DNA transcription. Notably, a functional loss-of-function SNP (rs17098707) in the coding region of the *GRK5* gene has been associated with blunting the effects of β-adrenergic receptor agonists via enhanced receptor desensitization.^8^ In that study, 4 amino acid-changing variants in the *GRK5* gene were identified. Three of these are extremely rare, but a glutamine to leucine substitution at amino acid residue 41 is more prevalent in African Americans (23%-35%) than in Caucasians (1%-2.4%). In a series of *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies, Liggett et al characterized the GRK5-Leucin (Leu41) variant, and found that it is associated with attenuation of β_1_-adrenergic receptor signaling in a manner similar to partial β_1_-adrenergic receptor antagonism with BBs. They also studied 2 cohorts of patients with heart failure and found that the GRK5-Leu41 variant protects against early death and the need for cardiac transplantation.^8^

Cresci et al corroborated these findings in a prospective large-scale study of heart failure patients.^30^ They observed that the GRK5-Leu41 variant is associated with improved long-term survival in African Americans with a history of heart failure while taking BBs. In a more recent case-control study,^31^ Lobmayer et al found that the GRK5-Leu41 variant in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease is associated with a decreased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, independent of treatment for hypertension. These findings indicate that the GRK5-Leu41 variant modifies the β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in a way similar to the partial β-adrenergic receptor antagonism by BBs, and it may alter the effectiveness of BBs.^8^

Although intriguing, the previous observations were made in African Americans. Our study subjects were Caucasian and the GRK5-Leu41 variant is very rare in this group. Thus, the earlier findings cannot be generalized to other ethnic groups. Of importance, the functional SNP rs17098707 was not represented on the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip used to genotype our discovery cohort, but it is located close to SNP rs3740563 - identified in our study as the most significant variant associated with postoperative AF despite perioperative BB therapy ([Figure 2](#F2)). While we were able to generate imputed genotype data for rs17098707 in the discovery cohort, its MAF was only 0.008, which is close to the MAF (0.01) estimated in the replication dataset where this marker is directly represented on the Illumina OMNI1-Quad BeadChip. With such low MAFs, this marker failed to meet our inclusion criterion, and it did not render sufficient power for the association analysis in our datasets. Nevertheless, our data showed that rs17098707 and rs3740563 were correlated to some degree with r^2^ = 0.083 and D’ = 1, where D’ was inflated by low MAF of rs17098707. Therefore, it is still likely that our most significant marker, rs3740563, may be a surrogate of rs17098707. Further investigations will be needed to determine the possible functional relevance of *GRK5* variants in altering the effectiveness of BB as the main therapy for preventing new-onset postoperative AF following CABG surgery.

Several studies have implicated that genetic variants of the β-adrenergic receptor-signaling pathway are associated with risk and outcomes in cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension,^32^ heart failure,^30^ and response to BBs^33, 34^ and β-adrenergic agonist therapy.^35, 36^ For example, carriers of 49Gly allele of the β1-adrenergic receptor gene (*ADRB1*),^37^ and individuals with the *ADRB1* Arg389Gly-Ser49Gly haplotype^38^ have an increased risk for AF. Individuals with the *ADRB1* Arg389Arg genotype have higher heart rates during AF and the highest cardioversion response rate to flecanide treatment.^38^ Furthermore, Parvez et al^3^ found that Caucasians with AF who are *ADRB1* Ser49Ser homozygous and carriers of at least one *ADRB1* 389Gly allele, are more likely to respond to rate-control therapy, including BBs. These patients also require the lowest doses of rate-control medications (including BBs) to achieve this response. They also noted that subjects with the Arg389Arg genotype consistently require higher doses of BBs, which may increase the likelihood of potential adverse effects. In a more recent study, Jeff et al^39^ observed that patients with the *ADRB1* Gly389Gly variant were at an increased risk for AF after cardiac surgery compared to patients with the common Arg389Arg variant. Conversely, they found in a subgroup of patients with perioperative BB therapy that the association between Gly389Gly variant and the risk for postoperative AF was no longer present, indicating that the risk for postoperative AF was modulated by treatment with BB therapy. Together, these findings indicate a potential role for genotyping patients for common variants in *ADRB1* in order to predict their risk for AF and response to prophylactic drug therapy, including BBs. In the current study including patients treated with perioperative BB therapy, we have not been able to replicate reported associations between common genetic variants within the candidate genes coding for other members of the β-adrenergic receptor-signaling pathway and in their association with the risk for postoperative AF.

Recent evidence suggests that genetic variation in CYP2D6 alters the metabolism of BBs, and may significantly influence the efficacy and safety of BBs.^3, 8, 9, 40^ *CYP2D6* is highly polymorphic, with at least 100 functional variants.^41^ Several of the lipophilic BBs (metoprolol, propranolol, carvedilol, and labetalol) are metabolized partially by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. Metoprolol is the most dependent on this enzyme, with 70% to 80% of its metabolism directed through this pathway.^7^ Clinical studies indicate that disposition and effectiveness of metoprolol could be influenced by *CYP2D6* genotype. Indeed, carriers of non-functional alleles of the *CYP2D6* gene (*CYP2D6*4;* rs3892097) have higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol potentially resulting in a more pronounced effect but with an increased risk for side effects and toxicity,^10, 21, 40^ whereas carriers of multiple copies of the *CYP2D6* gene have excessive CYP2D6 enzyme activity associated with lack of effectiveness and a higher rate of ventricular rhythm disturbance.^42^ Initially, none of the five *CYP2D6* SNPs available in Illumina Human610-Quad Beadchip passed the quality control process due to low genotyping quality,but we were able to generate 19 imputed SNPs with MAF ≥ 0.05 for additional analysis in the discovery dataset. Only five SNPs including rs16947, a missense variant with potential functional consequences for drug metabolism^43^ (MAF = 0.31; P = 0.048), met a nominal significance level (P < 0.05). After correcting for the multiple testing, none of them qualified as significant. Furthermore, among the 19 imputed SNPs, the non-functional variant of the *CYP2D6* gene (*CYP2D6*4;* rs3892097) identified by other investigators^44, 45^ was also tested, but it did not show a significant association with risk for postoperative AF, despite perioperative BB prophylaxis (MAF = 0.15; OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.56-1.34; P = 0.51). Several reasons may account for this negative replication for *CYP2D6* including variation in study design, the use of imputed data, dose and/or type of BBs used. Consequently, future studies are needed before a genotype-based personalized treatment strategy for AF can be developed.

The etiology of postoperative AF in the setting of cardiac surgery is a result of several potential genetic and non-genetic factors that are also likely to contribute to the response and efficacy of BBs. Such genetic factors include noncoding polymorphisms within the chromosome 4q25 region, which are associated with postoperative AF,^46^ or with symptomatic response to antiarrhythmic drug therapy for chronic AF.^47^ Non-genetic factors include drug-drug interactions as well as drug release/dissolution, absorption, or intestinal first-pass extraction.^48^ In addition, multiple other transient factors, such as heightened parasympathetic tone, atrial stretch, electrolyte shifts, metabolic abnormalities, inflammation, and pericarditis, have been associated with an increased risk for postoperative AF.^49^ However, given the case-cohort design of our study, we were not able to explore these and other genetic and non-genetic factors that may modulate the response to BB therapy in patients with new-onset postoperative AF following CABG surgery.

In genetic association studies such as ours, several factors including small sample size, overestimated effect size due winner's curse, and multiple testing could lead to false-positive findings.^23^ We have utilized a relatively large population of cardiac surgery patients in a case-cohort design to increase the statistical power of our study. In addition, we found that the impact of ascertainment bias on the effect size of our most significant *GRK5* SNP (rs3740563) was minimal. By selecting SNPs meeting our arbitrary false discovery rate threshold in the discovery cohort, we were able to reduce the number of tests in the replication dataset. The final meta-analysis results provided additional support for the association between *GRK5* and postoperative AF following CABG surgery^50^.

Although the total number of patients in our study was 808 samples, our dataset was still limited by the low number of cases. Given our sample size (111 cases and 452 controls) in the discovery dataset, and assuming 17% prevalence of postoperative AF, same MAF for both disease and risk alleles, and strong LD between disease and risk markers, our dataset had 80% power to detect a relative genotype risk ratio of 2.5 at 0.0001 significance threshold. This is close to what we observed for rs3740563 (OR = 2.75 and P = 4.78 × 10^-5^). This clearly demonstrates that our dataset, which targeted patients on perioperative BB therapy, would not have sufficient power to detect genome-wide significant variants (P < 5x10^-8^). A future large-scale genome-wide association study is needed to confirm our findings.

Finally, although the candidate gene design is a biased approach, it is balanced by our focus on a limited subset of biologically relevant candidate variants involved in adrenergic signaling and pharmacokinetic responses of BBs, which has substantially reduced the number of statistical comparisons performed. The mechanistic link between a) variation in genes known to modulate the adrenergic-signaling pathway and pharmacokinetic responses of BBs, and b) lack of effectiveness of BBs in preventing postoperative AF was not directly investigated in this genetic epidemiologic study. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report genetic risk for an unfavorable response to BB therapy for preventing new-onset postoperative AF in a cohort of cardiac surgery patients.

In conclusion, in patients treated with perioperative BB, variants in *GRK5* are independently associated with postoperative AF following CABG surgery. The functional significance of these polymorphisms may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of postoperative AF and modulation of response to BB therapy. This may inform the development of a perioperative strategy to personalize treatment options for new-onset postoperative AF.
