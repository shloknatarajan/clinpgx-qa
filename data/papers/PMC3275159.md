## Abstract

The coregulator steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 increases transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor (ER) in a number of tissues including bone. Mice deficient in SRC-1 are osteopenic and display skeletal resistance to estrogen treatment. SRC-1 is also known to modulate effects of selective ER modulators like tamoxifen. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in SRC-1 may impact estrogen and/or tamoxifen action. Because the only nonsynonymous SNP in SRC-1 (rs1804645; P1272S) is located in an activation domain, it was examined for effects on estrogen and tamoxifen action. SRC-1 P1272S showed a decreased ability to coactivate ER compared with wild-type SRC-1 in multiple cell lines. Paradoxically, SRC-1 P1272S had an increased protein half-life. The Pro to Ser change disrupts a putative glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3)β phosphorylation site that was confirmed by in vitro kinase assays. Finally, knockdown of GSK3β increased SRC-1 protein levels, mimicking the loss of phosphorylation at P1272S. These findings are similar to the GSK3β-mediated phospho-ubiquitin clock previously described for the related coregulator SRC-3. To assess the potential clinical significance of this SNP, we examined whether there was an association between SRC-1 P1272S and selective ER modulators response in bone. SRC-1 P1272S was associated with a decrease in hip and lumbar bone mineral density in women receiving tamoxifen treatment, supporting our in vitro findings for decreased ER coactivation. In summary, we have identified a functional genetic variant of SRC-1 with decreased activity, resulting, at least in part, from the loss of a GSK3β phosphorylation site, which was also associated with decreased bone mineral density in tamoxifen-treated women.

## Materials and Methods

### Plasmids and mutagenesis

The flag tagged pSG5-SRC-1 wild-type (WT) expression plasmid was provided by Dr. C. Smith (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The SRC-1 variant P1272S was generated by mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol.

### Cell culture and reporter assays

MCF-7 and HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM culture media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (MCF-7) or 10% fetal bovine serum (HepG2) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). U2OS-Flag-ERα cells were cultured as previously described ([27](#B27)) in DMEM/F12 (50:50) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum. Cells were plated 24–48 h before transfection. Cells were washed with PBS and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 and OPTI-MEM following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cotransfected with estrogen response element-thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase reporter (ERE-Tk-Luc) vector and pSG5-SRC-1 as indicated. Later experiments (as indicated) also included a tk-*Renilla* vector as a transfection control. Luciferase values determined using either the single or dual luciferase assay kits (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions and were normalized to total protein or *Renilla* as indicated. Cells were treated with the following approximately 12–14 h before cell harvesting: vehicle (ethanol), 10^−9^ m estradiol, or 10^−7^ m 4-OH-tamoxifen.

### Protein analysis

Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, sonicated, and used for Western blots. Antibodies used are as follows: anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), β-actin (Sigma: A5441), and β-tubulin (Sigma: T9026). For protein degradation studies, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) 24 h after transfection and cultured for the indicated amount of time, and protein was harvested for Western blot. Blot images were quantified using ImageJ ([http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/)).

### Kinase assay

Recombinant GSK3β was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Specific peptide sequences (each with a phospho-modification at corresponding GSK3β priming sites) were synthesized as follows (Biomatik Corp., Wilmington, DE): SRC-3: AGVHSPMApSerSGNTG, SRC-1 WT: LLQQTPPApSerGYQSP, and SRC-1 P1272S: LLQQT**S**PApSerGYQSP. *In vitro* kinase reactions were prepared following the manufacturer's instructions using the KinaseGlo luminescence-based detection method (Promega). Briefly, the assay quantifies remaining ATP in the reaction so that increased kinase activity reduces ATP levels and, subsequently, luciferase activity.

### Study population

Details of the clinical trial that was designed to identify associations between germline variants and tamoxifen-related phenotypes have been published previously ([10](#B10), [11](#B11)). The registry protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at all participating sites and registered on [www.clinicaltrial.gov](http://www.clinicaltrial.gov) ([NCT00228930](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00228930)). All patients had completed primary surgery, radiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy, if indicated, and provided written informed consent before entry. The complete BMD data set can be found on [www.pharmgkb.org](http://www.pharmgkb.org) with the accession ID: [PS207749](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/PS207749).

### Genotyping

Genomic DNA was isolated using QIAmp Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA), and genotyping was performed by Taqman assays, using commercially available ABI assay C_8722242_20 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). For quality controls purposes, approximately 10% of the samples were regenotyped and the concordance was 100%.

### Statistical analysis

This pharmacogenetics substudy, which was a secondary aim of the overall study, was designed to test the associations between polymorphisms in candidate genes and changes in BMD with 1 yr of tamoxifen therapy. Because this analysis was not the primary aim, however, the power to detect our observed genetic effect on BMD changes in tamoxifen-treated patients was <20%. Associations between SRC-1 genotypes (P1272S) and baseline lumbar and hip BMD were performed using linear regression. Associations between SRC-1 genotypes and the percent changes in lumbar and hip BMD from baseline to month 12 were assessed using a general linear model, which was performed using the SAS procedure (PROC general linear model, SAS version 9.1.3). The *in vitro* reporter assays were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (WT *vs.* P1272S and dose), where a *P* value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results

### Identification of a nonsynonymous functional SRC-1 variant with decreased coactivation potential

To investigate the role of variations at the human *SRC-1* locus in hormone response, we initially sought to identify SNPs in the coding regions of *SRC-1. In silico* analysis of the dbSNP database ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/index.html](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/index.html)) and a direct sequencing approach of all *SRC-1* coding exons in 48 Caucasian and 48 African-American subjects recently reported by us ([12](#B12)), led to the identification of a single nonsynonymous SNP (rs1804645) within the *SRC-1* gene. This variant results in a proline to serine substitution at amino acid position 1272 (P1272S) in exon 18 that maps to the activation domain 2 ([Fig. 1](#F1)A) and is found at a minor allele frequency of approximately 3% in European populations ([12](#B12), [13](#B13)) [0–3% in Asian and African populations ([13](#B13))]. Because this domain is critical for SRC-1's activation function ([14](#B14)), we first tested whether the P1272S variant demonstrated altered coactivation of ER by using ERE-TK-luc as a readout for ER activity and SRC-1 coactivation. This reporter was cotransfected with either the pSG5-SRC-1 WT or the pSG5-SRC-1 P1272S vector. Although transfection of the SRC-1 WT vector yielded a strong coactivation after treatment with estrogen in a hormone-responsive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), this was consistently attenuated in the presence of the SRC-1 P1272S vector ([Fig. 1](#F1)B). This effect was also seen after tamoxifen treatment. Similar findings were found in another hormone-responsive breast cancer cell line (T47D, data not shown).

Decreased ER coactivation potential of SRC-1 variant P1272S. A, Schematic of SRC-1 functional domains and the position of the P1272S SNP. bHLH, Basic helix-loop-helix PAS, PERT-ARNT-SIM; AD, activation domain; ND, nuclear receptor interaction domain; Q, glutamine rich region. B–D, SRC-1 P1272S reduces the ability of SRC-1 to coactivate ER. Cells were transiently transfected with ERE-TK-Luc reporter constructs and 100–200 ng of expression constructs for either WT or P1272S SRC-1 and treated with vehicle (white) or 10−9 m estradiol (black) or 10−7 m 4-OH-tamoxifen (gray) and relative luciferase units (RLU) were normalized to total protein with the exception of U2OS-ERα cells (D) where cells were cotransfected with 1 ng of tk-Renilla and normalized to Renilla activity using a dual-luciferase assay. Data are presented as fold over control vehicle treated. Bars represent the average fold change of duplicate or triplicate biological replicates, and error bars represent sd. Asterisks indicate P values <0.05, as calculated by two-way ANOVA. Tam, 4-OH-tamoxifen; veh, vehicle (ethanol).

Because of the widespread hormone resistance of the SRC-1^−/−^ mice and the evidence that SRC-1 is critical for the agonist/antagonist balance of tamoxifen, we next tested whether this reduction in coactivation is also seen in cell lines derived from tissues where tamoxifen acts as an agonist such as liver cells (HepG2; [Fig. 1](#F1)C) and bone cells (U2OS-ERα; [Fig. 1](#F1)D). Although the SNP had only a minimal effect on E2-mediated ER activity in these cell lines [U2OS-ERα (see Supplemental Fig. 1 published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at [http://mend.endoournals.org](http://mend.endoournals.org)); HepG2: data not shown], the SNP dramatically reduced the ability of tamoxifen to act as an agonist. Further, a similar effect was also observed for raloxifene, a SERM similar to tamoxifen that was originally developed to treat and prevent osteoporosis (Supplemental Fig. 1). Together, these data suggest that P1272S is a functional SRC-1 variant with the ability to decrease the ability of SRC-1 to coactivate ER, including decreasing the agonist activity of SERM-occupied ER.

### Mechanism of SNP effect

To gain a basic understanding of how the SNP impacts SRC-1 function, we first measured transfected SRC-1 WT and P1272S protein levels (via immunoblotting of flag-tagged proteins). Interestingly, steady-state protein levels of transfected SRC-1 P1272S were markedly higher than SRC-1 WT ([Fig. 2](#F2)A). A similar phenomenon was observed in HEK293 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2). SRC-1 WT and P1272S RNA levels did not differ from each other after actinomycin D treatment, indicating that RNA stability was not affected by the introduction of the SNP (data not shown). To explore the observation of altered steady-state protein levels further, we measured the half-life of SRC-1 WT and P1272S by treating the cells with cycloheximide for various lengths of time after transfection ([Fig. 2](#F2), B and C). There was a significant increase in half-life for P1272S (t_1/2_ = 359 min) compared with WT (t_1/2_ = 72 min) (*P* < 0.0001), suggesting that the SNP is sufficient to decrease SRC-1 protein turnover.

P1272S increases SRC-1 protein levels. U2OS-ERα cells were transfected with equal amounts of either SRC-1 WT or SRC-1 P1272S and then visualized by Western blot using an anti-flag antibody. A, Steady-state levels of SRC-1 P1272S are increased over SRC-1 WT. B, Approximately 30 h after transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide for varying lengths of time. SRC-1 P1272S protein half-life is extended compared with SRC-1 WT. C, Bands were quantified using ImageJ. SRC-1 intensity was normalized to β-actin and then normalized to the baseline time point. Asterisks indicate bands that were identified as outliers and excluded from the plot (C). Best-fit lines are significantly different from each other (P < 0.0001) with or without the two outlier bands excluded. CHX, Cyclohemimide.

These seemingly conflicting results for SRC-1 P1272S (decreased activity with increased protein levels) mirror that seen after disrupting a GSK3β site in SRC-3 ([9](#B9)), a closely related paralogue of SRC-1. We thus aligned the residues flanking the SRC-3 GSK3β site with SRC-1 and searched for putative GSK3β phosphorylation sites (S/T-P-X-X-S/T) with adjacent serine/threonine priming sites. Indeed a putative site overlapping the P1272S SNP was identified ([Fig. 3](#F3)A). Further, two of three priming sites identified in SRC-3 aligned with a serine residue in SRC-1, supporting the possibility that the putative site is functional. An established luciferase-based *in vitro* kinase assay revealed that increasing doses of GSK3β lead to increasing phosphorylation of SRC-3 and SRC-1 WT peptides (corresponding to decreased luciferase activity) ([Fig. 3](#F3)B). Conversely, luciferase levels remained constant in the presence of the P1272S peptide, similar to the no-peptide negative control. This indicates that GSK3β can phosphorylate SRC-1 (at the corresponding amino acid residue as an established site in SRC-3) and that the P1272S SNP is sufficient to disrupt this activity.

SRC-1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β and P1272S is sufficient to disrupt this activity. A, Alignment of GSK3β consensus kinase site with peptide sequence of previously established site in SRC-3 and putative site in SRC-1. The residue in the SRC-1 peptide corresponding to P1272S SNP is indicated. The first residue of the GSK3β consensus sequence is the target of GSK3β kinase activity as indicated. Bold and underlined residues represent possible GSK3β priming sites. The most N-terminal of these was phosphorylated in peptides used in in vitro kinase assay. B, Increasing dosages of recombinant GSK3β result in decreased luciferase activity (increased phosphorylation) for SRC-3 and SRC-1 WT peptides, however, the SRC-1 P1272S peptide and a no-peptide control are incapable of producing a similar effect. C, U2OS-ERα cells were cotransfected with either a nontargeting small interfering RNA pool or a pool targeting GSK3β (siGSK3β) along with an SRC-1 expression vector. Transfected SRC-1 was visualized by Western blot using an anti-flag antibody.

Finally, because we expected GSK3β to regulate SRC-1 in a mechanism similar to the one described for SRC-3, we reasoned that reducing GSK3β levels via small interfering RNA would increase SRC-1 protein levels. Indeed, upon reducing GSK3β levels, SRC-1 levels are increased, indicating that GSK3β is involved in regulating SRC-1 protein turnover ([Fig. 3](#F3)C). Together, these data demonstrate that 1) SRC-1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β, likely regulating its activity and protein levels in a similar manner to that described for SRC-3 and 2) the rs1804645 SNP resulting in a P1272S amino acid change is sufficient to disrupt this regulation, increasing SRC-1 stability while decreasing SRC-1 activity.

### Loss of BMD in tamoxifen-treated women with SRC-1 variant P1272S

Due to the mechanistic *in vitro* findings described above and the well-described role for SRC-1 in tamoxifen action and in bone biology, we set out to test whether the P1272S SNP associates with decreased hormone response in bone in women treated with tamoxifen. Specifically, we genotyped rs1804645 (P1272S) in a prospective observational clinical trial designed to test for associations between genetic variants in the ER pathway and tamoxifen metabolism, side effects, and secondary benefits including effects on bone ([15](#B15), [16](#B16)). Specifically, this trial recruited breast cancer patients or women at high risk for developing breast cancer who were treated with tamoxifen. Total hip and lumbar (average L1–L4) BMD was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry before initiation of tamoxifen therapy and 12 months later. The total study included 296 individuals ([Fig. 4](#F4)A). Thirty five individuals were excluded either because insufficient DNA was obtained or because of genotyping failure. An additional three individuals were excluded because of prior raloxifene usage (known effects in bone) or because their BMD scans were determined to be outliers. Because chemotherapy has been shown to have an effect on BMD ([17](#B17), [18](#B18)), an additional 118 individuals receiving chemotherapy were excluded from our analysis, leaving 140 individuals in the analysis. Baseline BMD data for lumbar and hip were available for 136 and 133 individuals, respectively. Paired BMD data for lumbar and hip after 12 months tamoxifen therapy were available for 111 and 106 individuals, respectively.

SRC-1 SNP P1272S is associated with decreased tamoxifen response in bone. A, Schematic detailing study population in the prospective observational clinical trial and final number used for association study. B, BMD values obtained via dual x-ray absorptiometry scan before (M0) and after 12 months (M12) of tamoxifen therapy. Numbers in legend indicate the number of individuals in each group with H = hip, L = lumbar, and numbers in parentheses representing M0 and M12, respectively. C, Percent change BMD after 12 months of tamoxifen therapy. Numbers in legend indicate the number of individuals in each group with numbers in parentheses representing hip and lumbar, respectively. Germline DNA was genotyped for the SRC-1 P1272S SNP using a commercially available assay from Applied Biosystems (see Materials and Methods).

Baseline BMD trended to be lower in women with the SNP, although this did not reach significance ([Fig. 4](#F4)B). Interestingly, after 12 months of treatment with tamoxifen, women carrying the P1272S allele showed a dramatic decrease in percent BMD change compared with women carrying the major allele ([Fig. 4](#F4)C and Supplemental Fig. 3). This was strongest in the lumbar measurements (WT: −1.30% ± 0.55, n = 107; SNP: −6.43% ± 1.62, n = 4; *P* = 0.037) and was borderline significant in the hip measurements (WT: −0.61% ± 0.43, n = 102; SNP: −4.30 ± 1.75, n = 4; *P* = 0.082).

Given the well-described effects of menopausal status on BMD, we reanalyzed our data focusing on peri- and postmenopusal women, the majority of patients in this trial. Of those women with baseline BMD data for lumbar and hip, 94 and 91 were peri- or postmenopausal, respectively. Similarly for those with matched lumbar and hip BMD data, 78 and 72 were peri- or postmenopausal, respectively. Analysis of baseline and change BMD further strengthened the association of the SNP with loss of BMD (Supplemental Fig. 4), although the relatively low numbers call for caution in interpretation. However, together with the known role of SRC-1 in hormone response, specifically in bone, and with our *in vitro* functional data, these clinical data provide evidence that the P1272S variant might play a role in determining bone metabolism in women, especially when treated with tamoxifen.

## Discussion

We present the characterization of the P1272S SNP in SRC-1and show it is sufficient to decrease the ability of SRC-1 to coactivate ERα. Further, we provide evidence that SRC-1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β, similarly to the SRC-3 phospho-ubiquitin clock previously described ([9](#B9)). We describe a likely mechanism of action of this SNP through the disruption of GSK3β-mediated regulation of SRC-1 activity and protein turnover. Finally, by genotyping for the SRC-1 P1272S SNP in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen, we obtained preliminary data suggesting that women harboring this SNP might not receive the beneficial effects of tamoxifen in maintaining BMD.

The previously established phospho-ubiquitin model of regulation was originally thought to be unique to SRC-3. Interestingly, compared with SRC-3, both SRC-1 and SRC-2 contain at least as many putative GSK3β (SRC-1: five sites; SRC-2: five sites; SRC-3: two sites) and putative ubiquitin/sumoylation sites (SRC-1: five sites; SRC2: three sites; SRC-3: three sites). Our data suggest that SRC-1 is also under a similar form of regulation. We showed that an SRC-1 peptide containing the putative site can be phosphorylated by GSK3β and that SRC-1 protein levels can be modulated by GSK3β. It is likely that the phospho-ubiquitin clock is conserved among all the SRC family members. The potent actions of these proteins as master regulators in a number of tissues require such a fine-tuned system allowing tight regulatory control. SRC-1 is somewhat unique among the SRC family members because none of the sites in SRC-2 or SRC-3 overlap with annotated nonsynonymous SNPs. Our discovery of the disruption of the PTM, and thus the phospho-ubiquitin clock by a germline variant, represents a novel mechanism of SNP action.

The studies presented here focus on how the SNP affects the ability of SRC-1 to coactivate the ER, however, SRC-1 coactivates other nuclear receptors (such as the progesterone or androgen receptors) and is involved in many other cellular processes. It is therefore likely that other undiscovered biological and clinical phenotypes exist and that the variant could have far reaching consequences. Thus, the P1272S SNP should remain a strong candidate for future association studies as larger phenotype-rich clinical datasets are developed. Further, to help identify the full impact of this SNP, its analysis in a mouse model would be a priority.

Our data suggest that this SNP may also be associated with decreased baseline BMD levels. Although the study size is limited, the association is strengthened by excluding premenopausal women in the analysis (compare [Fig. 4](#F4) and Supplemental Fig. 4). This suggests that the P1272S SNP may impact postmenopausal osteoporosis onset in addition to the pharmacogenetic effect on tamoxifen described here. Further, because raloxifene is commonly prescribed to treat and prevent osteoporosis (independent of breast cancer therapy), the fact that the P1272S SNP also reduces SRC-1's ability to coactivate ERα in the presence of raloxifene could have potential implications for the effectiveness of SERM therapy in the setting of osteoporosis.

Nakamura *et al.* ([19](#B19)) reported that E2 protects against bone loss by directly inducing osteoclast apoptosis. More recently, Krum *et al.* ([20](#B20)) reported that E2 acts on osteoblasts that, in turn, induce osteoclast apoptosis. Although it is currently unclear which bone cell type(s) SRC-1 is impacting, ongoing preliminary studies have revealed that SRC-1 is expressed in murine primary cultures of both cell types. Importantly, SRC-1 is induced during osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that its expression is critical for this cell type (data not shown), in agreement with the studies by Krum *et al.* ([20](#B20)). Our preliminary data in U2OS cells (which have been described as “osteoblast-like”) suggest that although we observe extended SRC-1 WT protein stability protein by tamoxifen and raloxifene, this does not occur in the presence of the P1272S SNP (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether SRC-1 levels behave similarly in osteoblast primary cultures and how this affects the complex signaling mechanisms between these two major bone cell types. Thus, detailed ongoing studies are underway to better understand the effect of hormone on SRC-1 turnover.

A number of genome-wide association studies have looked at SNPs associated with osteoporosis ([21](#B21)–[26](#B26)), however, we were unable to determine whether the P1272S SNP is associated with osteoporosis because the arrays used do not contain the P1272S SNP or a SNP in linkage disequilibrium with it. If confirmed in larger data sets, this SNP, together with other already identified SNPs, might help to identify a subset of women who would benefit from bone-preserving therapy. For SNPs such as the P1272S that have relatively rare minor allele frequencies, these types of *in vitro* studies provide the information required to develop an approach to group rare SNPs based on function that can eventually be used to explain more of the interindividual variability and ultimately predict drug response.

It is also possible that this SNP may impact breast cancer response to adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Because our study shows the SNP decreases ER activity and tamoxifen is used to block ER signaling in ER-positive breast cancer, this anticipates an improvement in tamoxifen response associated with this SNP. Finally, because SRC-1 has been previously implicated in breast cancer metastasis, it also raises the possibility that it may reduce the metastatic potential of breast cancer, potentially in a bone-specific manner. This would represent an exciting and understudied possibility of a germline variant impacting the aggressiveness of a cancer rather than cancer onset alone. It also provides a prime example for future applications of genomics for personalized medicine, in that a genetic variant can be beneficial, or harmful, depending on the disease and the organ site. Future studies are planned to test some of these potential implications.

Overall, this study represents a unique approach to undertake SNP-association studies. Specifically, we used strong biological justification to select a group of coregulators for SNP discovery efforts followed by *in vitro* testing that revealed a specific functional change. Additional studies revealed an effect of the SNP on a unique regulatory mechanism, involving a change in a critical posttranslational modification site. The *in vitro* effect predicted a specific clinical phenotype that was observed. This approach is in contrast to genome-wide association studies that investigate broad clinical phenotypes and have limited power to detect a low-frequency SNP (∼3%) with a very specific clinical phenotype. Thus, this study provides a model for future functional based SNP association studies in which SNP proven to have a functional impact are specifically genotyped for a clinical phenotype predicted by *in vitro* experiments. In summary, we show that a germline SNP can disrupt a regulatory mechanism unique to the p160 family of coactivators and may have an appreciable impact on human disease.
