## Abstract

**Background:** 
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare cancer that develops in soft tissue, particularly skeletal muscle tissue and occasionally hollow organs like the bladder or uterus. Vincristine (VCR) is the main therapy used in treatment of RMS, it is an alkaloid produced from vinca and it is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in pediatric oncology for the treatment of a number of tumors. The CYP3A5 enzyme is responsible for vincristine metabolism. The effect of CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism on the efficacy and toxicity of VCR on RMS patients still needs further research.

**Methods:** 
Genotyping for CYP3A5 SNPs rs776746, rs10264272 and rs41303343 was performed using Taqman Real-Time PCR assays in a retrospective cohort study of 150 RMS pediatric patients treated with vincristine. The relationship between these genotypes and RMS survival was then examined.

**Results:** 
We found that patients with CYP3A5*3/*3 had the highest incidence of vincristine-induced neuropathy reaching 61.3%. Patients with CYP3A5*1/*3, CYP3A5*3/*6 and the normal metabolizers with CYP3A5*1/*1 had frequencies of 22%, 10.7%, and 4.7%. patients with the lowest frequency of 1.3% were those with the CYP3A5*1/*6 genotype. There was no correlation between the genotypes of CYP3A5*3, CYP3A5*6, CYP3A5*7, and RMS survival. Initial risk, metastasis, response, convulsions, unsteady gait and hepatotoxicity grade had a significant effect on overall survival with p<0.05.

**Conclusion:** 
CYP3A5*1/*1 have less severe vincristine-induced neuropathy than CYP3A5 *1/*3, CYP3A5 *1/*6 and CYP3A5 *3/*3, CYP3A5 *3/*6. There is a significant influence of CYP3A5 mutation on neuropathy grade and assist of ADL as a part of neurotoxicity.

### Background:

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare cancer that develops in soft tissue, particularly skeletal muscle tissue and occasionally hollow organs like the bladder or uterus. Vincristine (VCR) is the main therapy used in treatment of RMS, it is an alkaloid produced from vinca and it is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in pediatric oncology for the treatment of a number of tumors. The *CYP3A5* enzyme is responsible for vincristine metabolism. The effect of *CYP3A5* genetic polymorphism on the efficacy and toxicity of VCR on RMS patients still needs further research.

### Methods:

Genotyping for *CYP3A5* SNPs rs776746, rs10264272 and rs41303343 was performed using Taqman Real-Time PCR assays in a retrospective cohort study of 150 RMS pediatric patients treated with vincristine. The relationship between these genotypes and RMS survival was then examined.

### Results:

We found that patients with *CYP3A5**3/*3 had the highest incidence of vincristine-induced neuropathy reaching 61.3%. Patients with *CYP3A5**1/*3, *CYP3A5**3/*6 and the normal metabolizers with *CYP3A5**1/*1 had frequencies of 22%, 10.7%, and 4.7%. patients with the lowest frequency of 1.3% were those with the *CYP3A5**1/*6 genotype. There was no correlation between the genotypes of *CYP3A5**3, *CYP3A5**6, *CYP3A5**7, and RMS survival. Initial risk, metastasis, response, convulsions, unsteady gait and hepatotoxicity grade had a significant effect on overall survival with p<0.05.

### Conclusion:

*CYP3A5**1/*1 have less severe vincristine-induced neuropathy than *CYP3A5* *1/*3, *CYP3A5* *1/*6 and *CYP3A5* *3/*3, *CYP3A5* *3/*6. There is a significant influence of *CYP3A5* mutation on neuropathy grade and assist of ADL as a part of neurotoxicity.

## Introduction

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare cancer that develops in soft tissue, particularly skeletal muscle tissue and occasionally hollow organs like the bladder or uterus. RMS can strike anyone at any age, but it is more common in children. Soft tissue sarcoma is responsible for 7% of cancers in children and 1% of cancers in adults [[1](#B1)].

The type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where it develops, tumor size, whether the cancer has progressed, and risk categorization into low, moderate, and high risk, all influence treatment decisions. Physicians generally used Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy in combination to treat cancer [[2](#B2)]. The typical chemotherapy regimen for treating RMS is a combination of vincristine, actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) [[3](#B3)].

Vincristine (VCR), an alkaloid produced from vinca, is frequently used in combination with other chemotherapeutic medications to treat a variety of cancers. It is one of the most prescribed drugs in paediatric oncology for the treatment of several tumors, including RMS. In the United States, Physicians prescribed vincristine in the treatment of more than half of all children with cancer [[4](#B4)]. Vincristine is largely metabolized in the liver by *CYP3A *subtype enzymes, notably *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* enzymes, with M1 (4-O-desacetyl-vincristine) being the primary metabolite and M2 (N-deformyl-vincristine) and M4 (4-O-desacetyl-N-deformyl-vincristine) being minor metabolites [[5](#B5)].

VCR’s most serious side effect is neurotoxicity, which can manifest as sensory, motor, or autonomic neuropathy. Paresthesia, muscle weakness, discomfort, and reduced sensation are among symptoms of VCR-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN). VIPN, which frequently manifests as a symmetric sensory-motor neuropathy, is the predominant adverse effect of vincristine. Foot drop, loss of deep tendon reflexes, unsteadiness, and discomfort or tingling are some of the warning indications [[6](#B6), [7](#B7)]. Up to 30% of patients could experience severe VIPN, necessitating either a dose reduction or end to treatment [[8](#B8), [9](#B9)].

Sensory neuropathy causes numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, as well as sensory nerve injury. Peripheral sensory numbness, paresthesia, decreased balance, tendon weakening, and gait abnormalities are common symptoms of motor neuropathy [[10](#B10)-[15](#B15)]. Dysuria and paralytic ileus are symptoms of autonomic neuropathy [[16](#B16)]. Patients may further experience autonomic symptoms including constipation or orthostatic hypotension. VCR can also induce cranial neuropathy, which can lead to visual and hearing problems, as well as blindness and deafness [[17](#B17)].

The *CYP3A5* enzyme catalyzes VCR [[18](#B18)], and *CYP3A5* is the functional enzyme that aids the liver in VCR clearance. Genetic variations in *CYP3A5* expression may affect the risk of VIPN and thus inter-individual variability in VCR metabolism. There are a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the *CYP3A5* gene that change how the enzyme works [[19](#B19)]. The name of the wild type allele is *CYP3A5**1 and the mutant alleles are *CYP3A5**3 rs776746, *CYP3A5**6 rs1026427, and *CYP3A5**7 rs4130334.

Only People with at least one *CYP3A5**1 allele can express high concentrations of the *CYP3A5* enzyme [[20](#B20)]. *CYP3A5**3 allele on the other hand, results in alternative splicing and prevents the production of proteins, reducing or eliminating the *CYP3A5* enzyme [[21](#B21), [22](#B22)].

The term “*CYP3A5* expressers” refers to individuals who have at least one functional allele (*1), whereas “*CYP3A5* non-expressers” are individuals who only have non-functional variant alleles. *CYP3A5**1 allele produces the active enzyme. Mutations in *CYP3A5**3, *CYP3A5**6, and *CYP3A5**7 result in a lack of functioning enzymes or none at all. The *CYP3A5**1 expression type has a 5 times greater intrinsic VCR clearance than the non-expression type [[5](#B5)].

Previous research has indicated that patients with *CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotypes are more likely to be white than black [[23](#B23), [24](#B24)]. Black Africans had a far higher likelihood of carriers of *CYP3A5* *1/*1 and *1/*3 displaying full- or partial-expression *CYP3A5* in comparison to white. In contrast, no black African (*CYP3A5* *3/*3) was a *CYP3A5* non-expressor. A homozygous *CYP3A5* non-expressor makes up 88% of the white population, and none of them express CYP3A normally [[25](#B25)].

Understanding the elements that influence VCR metabolism could help to explain why VCR reaction varies so much between people. The capacity to forecast therapy failure might aid in the development of more effective VCR dose regimens. Our hypothesis is that SNPs in *CYP3A5* could affect the enzyme’s functionality in VCR metabolism, which could affect treatment response. Based on these considerations, we conducted this study to determine the prevalence of three *CYP3A5* common nonfunctional SNPs in our cohort of Egyptian paediatric RMS patients: rs776746 (C 26201809 30 *CYP3A5**3), rs10264272 (C 30203950 10 *CYP3A5**6), and rs41303343 (C 32287188 10 *CYP3A5**7). Our goal was to see if the *CYP3A5* polymorphism has an effect on VCR therapy toxicity, response, and survival in RMS patients.

## Materials and Methods

*Patient eligibility and treatment*

This retrospective study provides information for pharmacogenetic research of vincristine toxicity and efficacy in a pediatric group receiving vincristine as part of an RMS therapy plan. One hundred fifty RMS pediatric patients under age of 18 were included in this retrospective study. Patients with chronic renal disease or chronic liver disease or patients who have any other types of cancer rather than RMS were excluded from the study.

We selected patients at the Children’s Cancer Hospital of Egypt (CCHE) from 2013 until 2017. The inclusion criteria were; newly diagnosed RMS patients, under 18 years of age, and had vincristine in their protocol. The exclusion criteria were; patients with chronic renal or liver disease or had any other type of cancer. They received treatment with a combination therapy which consists of the drugs vincristine; actinomycin and cyclophosphamide (VAC) as the standard treatment protocol for RMS.

The vincristine dose is 0.025 mg/kg/dose (maximum dose 2 mg) IV push with Infants < 1 year, 0.05 mg/kg/dose (maximum dose 2 mg) IV push with infants ≥ 1 year and < 3 years and 1.5 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose 2 mg) IV push with infants ≥ 3 years. This dose is the same in all types of RMS risk (low, intermediate, high).

Group sample sizes of 94 in group one and 56 in group two achieve 97% power to detect an odds ratio in the group proportions of 3.75. The proportion in group one is assumed to be 0.37 under the null hypothesis and 0.6877 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in group two is 0.3700. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test with pooled variance. The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.05. The significance level actually achieved by this design is 0.0497.

*Ethics statement*

The Children’s Cancer Hospital of Egypt 57357 Institutional Review Board (IRB) gave its approval to this retrospective study (Approval number: PT 2610). Before including patients in the study, parents or legal guardians had to sign a consent form.

*Blood sampling and DNA extraction*

We collected samples reserved in the biobank of the hospital; we took Peripheral blood sample (5 ml) from patients and collected in EDTA vacutainers. We extracted genomic DNA by a minicolumn DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. We measured DNA concentration and purity through using Nanoquant™ spectrophotometer (Infinite M200, TECAN, Switzerland). We stored DNA at –20°C to prepare for pharmacogenetic analysis.

*CYP3A5 Genotyping*

We performed genotyping for *CYP3A5**3 rs776746, *CYP3A5**6 rs10264272 and *CYP3A5**7 rs41303343 by using Taqman Real-Time polymerase chain reaction assays. A *CYP3A5**1 genotype is assigned by default if testing for other alleles (*3, *6, and *7) is negative. The polymorphism which occurs with *CYP3A5**3 rs776746 is 6981A>G, *CYP3A5**6 rs10264272 is 14685G>A and A/-, Insertion/Deletion is the polymorphism which occur with *CYP3A5**7rs41303343. We carried out *CYP3A5* genotype analyses by The TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays which use TaqMan® 5´-nuclease chemistry for amplifying and detecting specific polymorphisms in purified genomic DNA samples. Each assay allows genotyping of individuals for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).

*Clinical evaluation criteria*

An essential aspect of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapies is the assessment of the change in tumor burden. Based on The guidelines for (version 1.1) of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) [26]. Researchers classify the tumor response in each patient as a complete response (CR), complete response stationary lesion CR (SL), a partial response (PR), stationary disease (StD), or progressive disease (PD), Authors used these classifications to measure the efficacy of vincristine and its correlation with different genotypes and phenotypes.

*Statistical Analysis*

Nominal variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, continuous variables are described as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges depending on the normality of distribution. Descriptive statistics, frequency distributions and percentages were calculated for the study participants’ baseline characteristics, outcome variables and other covariates of interest. Unpaired comparisons of continuous outcomes were performed with Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney test depending on distribution of data. Unpaired comparisons of categorical outcomes were performed with the Chi-square-test or with Fisher’s exact test when any expected value was below five. A two-sided probability of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of both OS and EFS was provided. OS was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of date of death or date of last contact. EFS was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of initial failure for patients who fail. Failure includes the traditional endpoints of failure as relapse in any site, and death during treatment or after remission. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for SPSS, version 20.

## Results

*Patient characteristics, genotyping, and allele frequencies *

[Table 1](#T1) illustrates the patients’ baseline characteristics. A total of 150 pediatric RMS patients were enrolled receiving vincristine as part of their clinical treatment protocol for RMS. The study population had a mean age of 5.72 ± 4.04 years (range, 0.07 to 17.4 years) and included 87 male and 63 female patients. The mean body weight, height, and surface area were 21.5 ± 15.6 kg, 109.7 ± 25.7 cm and 0.96 ± 0.440.86 ± 0.39 m2, respectively. 35 patients (23.3%) had metastasis and there were no reported metastatic lesions in 76% of the patients. [Table 1](#T1) also shows the distribution of the genotypes. In our cohort, 72% carried rs776746 (10.7% as heterozygous and 61.3% as mutant homozygous), 12% mutant heterozygous had rs10264272, 4.7 % had no mutation and there was no detected mutation with rs41303343.

*Metabolizing status correlation with neurotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and their grades*

Results showed correlation between metabolizing status and different types of toxicity such neurotoxicity, thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity ([Figure 3](#F3)). Of the normal metabolizers, 4.8% experienced neuropathy, 0.0% thrombocytopenia and 2.6% experienced hepatotoxicity. 34% of intermediate metabolizers experienced neuropathy, 25% thrombocytopenia and 42.1% experienced hepatotoxicity. Poor metabolizers experienced neuropathy with the percentage of 61.2%, 75% experienced thrombocytopenia and 55.3% had hepatotoxicity.

Correlation of Intermediate, Normal and Poor Metabolizers with the A) grade of neuropathy, p=0.0, B) grade of thrombocytopenia, p=0.45, C) grade of hepatotoxicity, p=0.889, D) neurotoxicity, p=0.0, E) thrombocytopenia, p=0.653, and F) hepatotoxicity, p=0.419. Significance was measured by CTCAE v5.0 which shows the number of patients with different types of allele mutation and toxicity grade

[Figure 3](#F3) also illustrates the correlation between metabolizing status and the grade of different types of toxicity such neurotoxicity, thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity. All the normal metabolizers experienced grade1 neuropathy, while 0.0% experienced grade 2and grade 4neuropathy. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was experienced by 11.8% of the normal metabolizers, while 2.7% experienced grade1. Normal metabolizers experienced grade 2 hepatotoxicity with the percentage of 9.15% while none experienced grade 3 hepatotoxicity and grade 4 hepatotoxicity. None of the intermediate metabolizers experienced grade 1 neuropathy and 97.1% experienced grade2. The frequency of intermediate metabolizers which experienced grade 1 thrombocytopenia was 39.7% which was the highest and 17.6% of intermediate metabolizers experienced grade 3 which was the lowest frequent., 50% of intermediate metabolizers experienced grade 3 and grade 4 hepatotoxicity, while 27.3% experienced grade 2 hepatotoxicity.

Regarding poor metabolizers, 2.9% of the cases had grade 2 neuropathy and 98% grade 4 neuropathy. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was detected in 70.6% of the poor metabolizers and 55.6% experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia. 64.6% of poor metabolizers experience grade 1 hepatotoxicity and 50% of cases experienced grade 3 and grade 4 hepatotoxicity.

*Response and survival function *

We employed Overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), and clinical response as the endpoints in this retrospective cross-sectional study to measure the clinical outcomes ([Figure 4](#F4)). The mean follow-up duration 4.7 ± 28.7 months. the mean duration of OS was 4.7 ± 28.7 months, mean survival duration for 95% CI (48.078_67.384) for female and (62.669¬_78.301) for male, 5 years overall survival p value < 0.05*, the median duration of OS was 56.3 ± 28.7 months.

Kaplan Meier Showing OS and EFS of the Cohort Study. A) 5 years overall survival p < 0.05*, B) 5 years event free survival p = 0.51

The mean duration EFS was 43.5 ± 31.3 months, 5 years EFS mean survival duration for 95% CI (46.060_67.617) for female and (53.848_71.270) for male, the 5 years Event free survival p value = 0.51, the median duration EFS was 40.9 ± 31.3 months. Our results represent the frequencies of clinical response for patients with complete remission 44.7 % and 4.0 % for Stationary Disease. Our results showed a significant association between gender and overall survival, there is no significant correlation between *CYP3A5* interpretation and OS.

[Table 3](#T3) illustrated factors influencing overall survival and showed that the number of patients who are still alive are 31 female and 57 male, number of patients at which the event occur (dead) are 32 females and 30 males. The probability of 5 years overall survival is 49.3% with female and 65.7% with male. The probability of 5 years overall survival in patients with metastasis is 21.6% and the probability of 5 years overall survival in patients without metastasis 67.9% which showed a significant correlation between metastasis and OS with p value < 0.05. The probability of 5 years overall survival in patients with complete response is 92.4% and 13.8% in patients with progressive disease which show a significant effect of response on overall survival with a p value < 0.05.

Table 3 Caption: Factors Influencing the 5 Years OS

As shown in [Table 3](#T3) there was a significant association of convulsions, unsteady gait and hepatotoxicity grade with OS. [Table 4](#T4) illustrated factors influencing Event free survival (progression of disease) and showed that the number of patients without event are 36 female and 50 male, number of patients at which the event occur (progression of disease) are 27 female and 36 males. The probability of 5 years event free survival is 50% with female and 58.1% with male. Our results showed non-significant correlation between gender and event free survival, there is no significant association between *CYP3A5* interpretation and EFS. The probability of 5 years event free survival in patients with metastasis is 14.7% and the probability of 5 years overall survival in patients without metastasis 66.8% which showed a significant association between metastasis and EFS with p value < 0.05.The probability of 5 years overall survival in patients with complete response is 90.8%, 64.7% and 0% in patients with progressive disease and 80% in patients with stationary disease which show a significant effect of response on overall survival with a P value < 0.05. As shown in [Table 4](#T4) there was a significant association of neuropathy grade and hepatotoxicity grade with EFS.

## Discussion

This study investigated the effect of *CYP3A5* genetic polymorphism on peripheral neuropathy induced by vincristine. We found that *CYP3A5**1/*1 (normal metabolizer) have less severe vincristine-induced neuropathy when compared to *CYP3A5* *1/*3, *CYP3A5* *1/*6 (intermediate metabolizers) and *CYP3A5* *3/*3, *CYP3A5* *3/*6 (poor metabolizers). Patients who have *CYP3A5* expresser genotypes *1/*1 and *1/*3, experience high metabolic and high clearance rate of vincristine, while people who have the *CYP3A5* non-expresser genotypes, *3/*3 and *CYP3A5* *3/*6, experience low metabolic and low clearance rate of vincristine thus are at high risk of developing vincristine induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN).

In our study we found that 98% of the patients enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional study had signs of neuropathy. Convulsions and optic atrophy were the most common neuropathies which occurred in 96% in the patients. Limited sensory perception occurred in 67.3% of the cases, unsteady gait in 79.3%, assist of activities of daily living (ADL) in 87.3%, constipation in 90.7%, and ptosis in 92% of the patients. Limited mobility was less frequent, and occurred in 22.7% of the patients.

In a study of 18 lymphoma pateints, researchers closely monitored patients for the onset of peripheral neuropathy, they discovered that after three months of vincristine therapy, all individuals had missing ankle reflexes and 75% had sensory signs or symptoms, diminished vibration feeling being the most common (62.5%). Constipation (62.5%) was the only autonomic indication, while motor abnormalities were substantially less frequent (18.7%). They detected denervation (46.7%) by concentrated needle electromyography, particularly in the hand’s tiny muscles [[27](#B27)]. The study of Egbelakin et al. reported that vincristine-induced neuropathy is less severe in active *CYP3A5* expressers than in non-expressers. *CYP3A5* expresser and non-expresser groups had significantly different rates of vincristine-induced neuropathy [[18](#B18)].

The study illustrates the frequencies of *CYP3A5* different genotypes, patients who have *CYP3A5* *3/*3 represent 61.3%, *CYP3A5* *1/*3 represents 22%, *CYP3A5* *3/*6 represents 10.7%, *CYP3A5* *1/*6 represents 1.3% and 4.7% for patients who have *CYP3A5* *1/*1. To adjust dose for specific patients, it is necessary to assess the severity of the side effects, specifically neurotoxicity, between the different genotype groups. Of the enrolled patients, 92% with poor metabolizing status had *CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotype, 100% of patients with normal metabolizing status had *CYP3A5* *1/*1 genotype and we found that 64.7% of patients with intermediate metabolizing status had *CYP3A5* *1/*3 genotype, 3.9% of patients with intermediate metabolizing status had *CYP3A5* *1/*6 genotype and 31.4% of patients with intermediate metabolizing status had *CYP3A5* *3/*6 genotype. Similar to another study demonstrated *CYP3A5* genetic polymorphisms in different ethnic populations and reported that *CYP3A5**3, *CYP3A5**6, and *CYP3A5**7 allele distribution was shown to be significantly different between white and Black populations. Around 93% of white Canadians have the *CYP3A5**3 allele, compared to 77.6% of Zimbabweans (p 0.001); this difference in frequency is significant. *CYP3A5**6 and *CYP3A5**7 alleles, on the other hand, are uncommon in white people (p 0.001) but very common in African people (10–20% each). These variations may be the results of local environmental conditions in geographically separate places [[23](#B23)].

We found that the patients who had *CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotype are poor metabolizers thus directly affecting vincristine concentration in blood leading to high neurotoxicity rates. 61.2% of neuropathy occurred in patients had *CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotype which is the highest percentage in comparison with other genotypes.

These ratios will lead us to the fact that there is a significant variation in vincristine metabolism depending on *CYP3A5* genotype, which made a difference in metabolic ratio and primary metabolite production between *CYP3A5* expressers and non-expressers. Due to that reason, *CYP3A5* expressers experience less vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) than do non-expressers. The percentage of neuropathy occurring in patients with *CYP3A5* *1/*1 genotype was 4.8%, 21.8% of neuropathy in patients with *CYP3A5* *1/*3 genotype, 10.9% of neuropathy in patients with *CYP3A5* *3/*6 genotype and 1.4% of neuropathy in patients with *CYP3A5* *1/*6 genotype which is the less frequent, while 61.2% of neuropathy occurred in patients with *CYP3A5* *3/*3 genotype which is the most frequent. Another toxicity which the patients suffered from is hepatotoxicity with percentage of 74.4% and 94.7% experienced thrombocytopenia.

Our results showed that one of the parameters which have a significant influence on vincristine efficacy and toxicity is single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the *CYP3A5* gene, which may influence the amount of enzyme produced. In our study, *CYP3A5* different mutations have an association with the reduction of metabolizing status which by extension affect gene expression, our cohort study showed that *CYP3A5* mutations have a significant effect on metabolizing status of vincristine for every individual with p value < 0.05.There was a significant influence of *CYP3A5* mutation on neuropathy grade and assist of ADL as a part of neurotoxicity with p value < 0.05, and there was a significant effect of metabolizing status on neuropathy grade with p value 0.000.

Parameters which have a significant influence on event free survival in our study are stage, initial risk, metastasis, response, neuropathy grade and hepatotoxicity grade with p value < 0.05. Stage, initial risk, metastasis, response, convulsions, unsteady gait and hepatotoxicity grade have a significant effect on overall survival with p value < 0.05.

In conclusions, *CYP3A5* expressors (normal, intermediate metabolizers) have less severe vincristine-induced neuropathy than non-expressors (poor metabolizers). There is a significant influence of *CYP3A5* mutation on neuropathy grade and assist of ADL as a part of neurotoxicity with p value < 0.05.
