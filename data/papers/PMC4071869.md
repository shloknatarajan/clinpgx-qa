## Abstract

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly administered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of various aggressive cancers. Severe toxicity to 5-FU has been associated with decreased levels of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity. Manifestations of 5-FU toxicity typically include cytopenia, diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, neurotoxicity, and, in extreme cases, death. A number of genetic variations within DPYD, the gene encoding DPD, are known to result in decreased DPD enzyme activity and contribute to 5-FU toxicity. Recently it was shown that healthy African American individuals carrying the Y186C DPYD variant (rs115232898) had significantly reduced DPD enzyme activity compared to non-carriers of Y186C. In the present study, we describe for the first time an African American cancer patient with the Y186C variant who developed severe toxicity following administration of the standard dose of 5-FU chemotherapy. The patient lacked any additional toxicity associated variations within the DPYD gene or the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) promoter. This case report suggests that Y186C may have contributed to 5-FU toxicity in this patient and supports the use of Y186C as a predictive marker for 5-FU toxicity in individuals of African ancestry.

## Introduction

5-Flurouracil (5-FU) and its pro-drug capecitabine are widely used agents in the management of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal malignancies. Though 5-FU-based treatment is generally well tolerated, approximately 31–34% of cancer patients develop dose-limiting grade 3–4 toxicities [[1](#R1)]. Pharmacogenetic studies of patients receiving 5-FU-based chemotherapy have focused on the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the 5-FU catabolic pathway, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which is responsible for catabolism of 80–85% of administered 5-FU [[2](#R2)]. DPD impairment leads to a toxic accumulation of 5-FU in treated patients, and manifests as exaggerated 5-FU toxicities, which include cytopenia, mucositis, hair loss, diarrhea, neutropenia, skin rash and neurologic toxicities [[3](#R3)]. Approximately 43–59% of patients experiencing unanticipated 5-FU toxicity have decreased DPD activity, ranging from partial to complete deficiency [[4](#R4)]. Patients with DPD deficiency have been reported to have as high as a 10-fold increase in 5-FU half-life and are at significantly higher risk of developing dose-limiting toxicity when treated with standard 5-FU doses [[5](#R5)–[7](#R7)].

DPD deficiency can result from allelic variations within the *DPYD* gene. Over 100 amino acid-changing variants have been reported, however only a small fraction have been shown to affect DPD enzyme activity as using functional testing [[8](#R8)]. To date, only three *DPYD* variants are known to associate with 5-FU-related toxicity: *DPYD*2A* (c.1905+1 G>A, rs3918290), D949V (c.2846A>T, rs67376798), and I560S (c.1679 T>G, DPYD*13, rs55886062) [[9](#R9)–[14](#R14)]. Of note, these commonly screened *DPYD* variants have limited utility in individuals of African descent due to previously reported low frequencies [[15](#R15)].

In contrast to the incidence of approximately 3–5% in the Caucasian population, we previously reported that the incidence of DPD deficiency is three times more common in African Americans than in Caucasians [[16](#R16)]. DPD deficiency seems to be more prevalent in certain sub-populations than others. For example, the DPD activity in a group of Ghanaian individuals was well below the normal level [[17](#R17)]. Recently, Offer et al. reported on an African specific *DPYD* variant Y186C (rs115232898, c.557 A>G) that was associated with decreased DPD activity [[15](#R15)]. There have been limited studies directly investigating *DPYD* variants for association with 5-FU-toxicity in individuals of African descent.

In this case report, we describe genetic analysis of an African American patient with stage IV colon cancer who developed severe toxicity after receiving the first course of a 5-FU-based regimen.

## Case Report

A 60-year-old African American, female patient presented after several weeks of GI bleeding and weight loss. The patient's past medical history included hypertension, asthma, fibromyalgia, and bipolar disorder. The patient underwent colonoscopy with biopsy of a suspicious mass, revealing adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains of the tumor were CK20 and CDX2 positive and CK7 negative, consistent with colonic origin. PET scan for staging revealed the following: metastatic tumor above and below the diaphragm, abnormal FDG uptake in left supraclavicular region and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, innumerable liver lesions, diffuse retroperitoneal and portacaval lymphadenopathy, and abnormally thickened sigmoid colon. With these findings, the patient was staged as metastatic colon cancer (stage IV). The patient's performance status was zero, and she was started on systemic therapy with FOLFOX (fluorouracil 400mg/m2 IV push, fluorouracil 2400mg/m2 IV infusion over 46 hours, leucovorin 400mg/m2, and oxaliplatin 85mg/m2), with the plan to add bevacizumab once the poorly controlled hypertension was resolved. Approximately ten days following administration of the first cycle of FOLFOX, the patient presented with severe mucositis, esophagitis, inadequate pain control, and dehydration, necessitating hospitalization. On admission to the hospital the patient was pancytopenic with a white blood cell count of 2.4 K/uL (range 4.0–11.0 K/uL), absolute neutrophil count of 1.2 K/uL (range 1.5–7.5 K/uL), hemoglobin 10.8 G/DL (range 13.5–16.0 G/DL), and platelet count of 80 K/uL (range 150–400 K/uL). A comprehensive metabolic profile was normal other than an elevated BUN of 34 MG/DL (range 6–24 MG/DL), Potassium of 3.1 MEQ/L (range 3.6–.5.1 MEQ/L), Albumin of 3.3 GM/DL (range 3.4–4.8 GM/DL), Phosphorus of 2.5 MG/DL (2.7–4.5 MG/DL), alkaline phosphatase of 146 IU/L (range 40–130 IU/L), and an LDH of 288 IU/L (range 50–175 IU/L). Coagulation panel revealed a PT of 14.0 sec (range 9.7–13.6 sec) and an INR of 1.3 (range 0.9–1.1).

The patient's hospital course was complicated by persistent pancytopenia, with a nadir WBC of 700 and an ANC of zero, unresponsive to growth colony stimulating factors that spontaneously recovered twenty days after chemotherapy ([Figure 1](#F1)). Patient developed *clostridium difficile* while hospitalized that led to sigmoid colon perforation with peritonitis. The patient and her family refused surgery and she was placed on IV ertapenem, fluconazole, and oral vancomycin as conservative management, as well as total parental nutrition. Patient also developed Isolated Factor VII deficiency of unknown etiology. INR peaked at 3.1. Mixing study was consistent with isolated functional Factor VII deficiency. Factors II, V, X were within normal limits. Repeat mixing study three days later showed the same distribution of factor functionality. INR improved to 1.6 with Vitamin K administration. Patient also had delirium of unknown etiology but was responsive to risperidone 0.25mg orally BID. The patient's condition continued to worsen and the decision was made to pursue in home hospice care, and the patient was discharged to home after her nearly four-week hospital stay where she died the following week. No autopsy was performed.

### Special Studies

A total of 8.5 mL of the patient's blood was collected in PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes (Qiagen, Valencia CA), and isolation of genomic DNA was performed using the PAXgene Blood DNA Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The patient signed a consent form approved by the institution.

Genetic analysis of the *DPYD* gene was performed by PCR amplification of all 23 exons using a previously reported method, followed by Sanger sequencing at the Medical Genome Facility of Mayo Clinic [[18](#R18)]. Direct sequencing of *DPYD* coding regions identified the following heterozygous missense variants: C29R (rs1801265; c.85 T>C) and Y186C (rs115232898; c.557 A>G). In addition, the patient carried 6 heterozygous noncoding intronic sequence variants. Additional targeted genotyping of 101 variants across 13 different genes associated with response/toxicity to 5-FU and oxaliplatin was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. Targeted genotyping results confirmed the presence of both *DPYD* missense variants and identified additional variants in the following genes: *UMPS* (also known as *OPRT*), *UPP1*, *TYMS*, *XRCC1*, and *GSTP1*. To determine the 28 base pair (bp) tandem repeat status (rs45445694) in the TS promoter enhancer region (TSER) of the TS gene (*TYMS*) and the repeat G>C variant status (rs2853542), we PCR amplified a 220bp region of the promoter region as previously reported [[19](#R19)]. The resulting PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. Sequencing of the *TYMS* promoter region identified the patient as a homozygous carrier for the 3R allele, in which both alleles contained the G nucleotide at the 12^th^ position of the second repeat (3RGGC / 3RGGC). All of the patient's variants identified by Sanger sequencing and targeted genotyping are summarized in [Table 1](#T1).

## Discussion

In this manuscript we report life threatening toxicity in an African American female with colon cancer who was treated with 1 course of standard dose FOLFOX. Within the *DPYD* gene, the nonsynonymous variants Y186C and C29R were both detected as heterozygous. Y186C has been previously reported to be most prevalent in the African super-population and that all identified carriers of the Y186C variant also carried C29R [[15](#R15)]. Though we were unable to measure DPD enzyme activity in our patient due to low PBM cell count, Offer et al also showed that DPD enzyme activity of African American Y186C carriers was approximately half (54%) of that of African American non-carriers, suggesting that the Y186C variant may contribute to decreased DPD activity in an African American population [[15](#R15)]. To date, this is the first report identifying the Y186C variant in a 5-FU toxic African American patient.

Comprehensive genetic analysis of the *DPYD* gene revealed no unknown amino acid-changing DPYD variants and none of the variants commonly associated with 5-FU-related toxicity (*DPYD*2A*, D949V, and I560S). Furthermore, genotyping showed no other abnormalities for variants within other catabolic and anabolic 5-FU genes (*DPYS*, *TK1*, *TYMP*, and *MTHFR*) that have previously been implicated in other 5-FU toxicity association studies. Though we did identify a nonsynonymous variant in the *UMPS* gene (rs1801019; G213A) and a noncoding 5'-upstream variant (rs3763506; chr7:48128850 T>C) in the *UPP1* gene, there is no reported evidence linking the two variants with 5-FU-related toxicity. Our analysis of *TYMS* variants identified the patient as homozygous for the 3RGGC repeat and heterozygous for the *TYMS* 3'UTR 6-bp deletion (c.1531–1536 AAGTTA / DEL), signifying a moderate to high TS expression genotype [reviewed in [20](#R20)]. High TS expression genotypes have previously been shown to associate with decreased therapeutic response and decreased incidence of toxic events during 5-FU treatment [[21](#R21)–[23](#R23)], suggesting that the patient's *TYMS* genotype does not contribute to the observed 5-FU toxicities.

Since the patient also received oxaliplatin, our genetic analysis included variants within the nucleotide excision repair pathway (*XRCC1*, *ERCC1*, and *ERCC2*) and the oxaliplatin metabolism/detoxification gene *GSTP1*. No variations were detected in the *ERCC1* and *ERCC2* genes, but we did identify heterozygous variants in *XRCC1* (V72A, rs25496, c.215 A>G) and *GSTP1* (I105V, rs1695, c.313 G>A). Previous studies have suggested a potential association between the *GSTP1* I105V variant and increased oxaliplatin related neuropathy [[24](#R24)–[26](#R26)], however discrepant results exist [[27](#R27),[28](#R28)]. The *GSTP1* I105V variant has a minor allele frequency of ~43% in individuals of African descent and is predicted to have a benign effect on the translated protein. The *XRCC1* V72A variant has only been identified in individuals of African descent as determined by the 1000 Genomes and Exome Sequence Variant projects and is predicted to have a potential damaging effect on the encoded protein. To date there have been no previous studies that have included the *XRCC1* V72A variant in genetic association studies with oxaliplatin toxicity or response.

## Conclusions

An African American female colon cancer patient presented with severe 5-FU-related toxicities after the first cycle of FOLFOX chemotherapy for advanced stage IV colon cancer. Though genetic analysis revealed no *DPYD* variants known to be associated with 5-FU toxicity, the patient was heterozygous for the African-specific Y186C variant of *DPYD*, which has previously been shown to associate with decreased DPD activity. This case study is the first report to identify the Y186C variant in a severely toxic patient receiving a standard dose of a 5-FU-based therapeutic regimen, suggesting the variant has utility as a predictive genetic marker for 5-FU-related toxicity.
