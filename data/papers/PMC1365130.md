## Abstract

1. The atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine, used in the treatment of resistant schizophrenia, is metabolized partly by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. Two phenotypes with respect to the activity of the enzyme are recognized (extensive metabolisers (EM) and poor metabolisers (PM)), resulting from allelic variation in the gene, CYP2D6. 2. Genotype was determined in 123 schizophrenic patients currently being treated with clozapine, in order to determine if EM or PM status influences response to this drug. Patients were divided into responders and non-responders using the Global Assessment Scale, and genotyped for the A and B poor metaboliser mutations by digesting PCR products with HpaII or BstNI. 3. Fifty-nine patients were heterozygous for allele B and for allele A. Eight patients were determined as poor metabolisers since they were homozygous either for A and B. Poor metabolisers were equally distributed between responders and nonresponders and no correlation between CYP2D6 alleles and response to clozapine was found. 4. The results are consistent with recent findings showing that CYP1A2, rather than CYP2D6, is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of clozapine.
