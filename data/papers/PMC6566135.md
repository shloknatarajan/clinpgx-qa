## Abstract

**Aim:** 
To determine if selected serotonergic and noradrenergic gene variants are associated with heroin addiction.

**Subjects & methods:** 
A total of 126 variants in 19 genes in subjects with Dutch European ancestry from The Netherlands. Subjects included 281 opioid-dependent volunteers in methadone maintenance or heroin-assisted treatment, 163 opioid-exposed but not opioid-dependent volunteers who have been using illicit opioids but never became opioid-dependent and 153 healthy controls.

**Results:** 
Nominal associations were indicated for 20 variants in six genes including an experiment-wise significant association from the combined effect of three SLC18A2 SNPs (rs363332, rs363334 and rs363338) with heroin dependence (pfinal = 0.047).

**Conclusion:** 
Further studies are warranted to confirm and elucidate the role of these variants in the vulnerability to opioid addiction.

### Aim:

To determine if selected serotonergic and noradrenergic gene variants are associated with heroin addiction.

### Subjects & methods:

A total of 126 variants in 19 genes in subjects with Dutch European ancestry from The Netherlands. Subjects included 281 opioid-dependent volunteers in methadone maintenance or heroin-assisted treatment, 163 opioid-exposed but not opioid-dependent volunteers who have been using illicit opioids but never became opioid-dependent and 153 healthy controls.

### Results:

Nominal associations were indicated for 20 variants in six genes including an experiment-wise significant association from the combined effect of three *SLC18A2* SNPs (rs363332, rs363334 and rs363338) with heroin dependence (p_final_ = 0.047).

### Conclusion:

Further studies are warranted to confirm and elucidate the role of these variants in the vulnerability to opioid addiction.

## Materials & methods

### Subjects

Three subject groups were recruited in The Netherlands as previously described ([Table 1](#T1)) [[22–25](#B22)], including:

### Table 1. . Subject characteristics.

| Treatment group | Subjects recruited (NR) | Caucasian (self-report) | Caucasian (AIMs) | Excluded (DNA low quality) | Subjects analyzed (NA) | Mean age ± SD | % Male |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OD | 400 | 289 | 285 | 4 | 281 | 43 ± 8 | 75 |
|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| NOD | 198 | 171 | 166 | 3 | 163 | 40 ± 9 | 65 |
|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| HC | 197 | 168 | 158 | 5 | 153 | 39 ± 10 | 56 |
|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Total | 795 | 628 | 609 | 12 | 597 | 42 ± 10 | 68 |

Table 1 Caption: AIM: Ancestry informative marker; HC: Healthy control; NOD: Exposed but not opioid dependent; OD: Opioid dependence; SD: Standard deviation.

All participants had to be at least 25 years of age. Recruitment was through advertisements in local media, as well as through personal contacts or referral by other volunteers (snowball sampling).

The Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects in The Netherlands (protocol number P04.0156C) approved the study of heroin-assisted and methadone maintenance treatments and the human molecular genetics study for all study groups. The genetics study was also approved by The Rockefeller University's Institutional Review Board. All subjects signed informed consent for the study, including the genetics research.

### Socio-demographic & drug use assessment

All subjects were interviewed by trained clinical investigators. Standard questionnaires were used for collection of data on age, gender and country of origin. The DSM-IV was used for the diagnosis of OD.

Additionally, the Kreek–McHugh–Schluger–Kellogg (KMSK) scale [[26](#B26)], a rapid and quantitative instrument to assess a subject's exposure to opioids, cocaine, alcohol and nicotine was used to assess the frequency, amount and duration of exposure to each substance during the subject's period of greatest use (lifetime score) was administered in The Netherlands. Kreek–McHugh–Schluger–Kellogg assessments have previously been evaluated using receiver operator characteristics analysis for the optimal cut-point score for alcohol, cocaine and opiate dependence/addiction diagnoses using an ethnically diverse population [[26](#B26)]. The originally reported cut-points were used in the present study.

### Genotyping

Genomic DNA was isolated from the blood specimens of all subjects by standard methods. Genotyping of 152 SNPs in 19 genes ([Table 2](#T2) & [Supplementary Table 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2018-0137/suppl_file/pgs-20-331-s2.docx)) was performed using a custom Illumina Golden Gate Panel (GS0013101-OPA; Illumina, Inc., CA, USA) [[7](#B7)], a modification of the ‘addiction array’ described previously [[27](#B27)]. Data analysis was performed using BeadStudio v2.3.43 (Illumina, Inc.). Clustered genotype data were manually inspected for quality. Only SNPs with good separation of clusters, call rates >90% and minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05 were used for association analyses.

### Assessment of percentage of European ancestry

Ethnicity was initially assigned based on self-reported family origin data with 628 self-identified Caucasian subjects, as previously described [[22](#B22)]. Based on 155 ancestry informative markers (AIMs), the fraction of genetic affiliation of the individual in each of the seven clusters was calculated using Structure v2.2 [[28](#B28)]. Each subject was anchored against 1051 samples from 51 worldwide populations represented in the Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel, as described [[29](#B29)]. For the current study the inclusion criteria was set to 70% or greater European ancestry contribution estimate to minimize population stratification, as described previously [[22](#B22)].

### Statistical analyses

Using Plink v1.9 [[30](#B30)] we computed p-values for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). To be conservative and only reject SNPs with strong deviation from HWE, a χ^2^ test with a critical limit for significance of p ≤ 0.01/n, where n = number of SNPs evaluated, was used in healthy controls. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) was estimated using Haploview v4.2 [[31](#B31)]. Case–control association analyses were performed in two ways; for each SNP separately and for a combination effect of multiple SNPs.

#### Single SNP analysis

For each SNP, a maximum test was applied as follows. Consider a 2 × 3 contingency table with rows corresponding to cases and controls and the three columns representing the three genotypes, 1/1, 1/2 and 2/2, at a given SNP, where the ‘1’ allele is the minor allele. For dominant action of the ‘1’ allele, columns 1 and 2 (genotypes 1/1 and 1/2) are collapsed into a single column, resulting in a 2 × 2 table, for which χ^2^ test is computed. Analogously, for recessive action, columns 2 and 3 are collapsed, leading to another 2 × 2 table with its χ^2^ value. The larger of the two χ^2^ represents the test statistic, *t*, for the given SNP, while *t* _max_ is the largest test statistic over all SNPs. Empirical significance levels (p-values) were obtained via permutation sampling by randomly permuting the labels case and control. In each of the resulting permuted datasets, the same test statistics were computed for each SNP and over all SNPs. For each SNP, a nominal significance level, p_0_, was obtained as the proportion of randomization samples with a value of *t* at least as large as the observed *t*, and a significance level corrected for testing multiple SNPs – p – was given as the proportion of randomization samples with *t* _max_ at least as large as in the observed data. These significance levels were based on a total of 100,000 permutation samples.

#### Gene-based analysis via scan statistics

Burden tests are a common approach to capture the joint association effect of multiple contiguous SNPs [[32](#B32),[33](#B33)]. To obtain accurate significance levels with such a procedure, we implemented a burden test via scan statistics in the following manner. Consider a window of a certain size, n (number of contiguous SNPs), and within this window we compute some test statistic, *h*. The window is moved across all the studied SNPs within a chromosome, one by one, and at each step *h* is recalculated. The largest value of *h* so obtained is called the scan statistic of size *n* [[34](#B34)]. In our implementation [[35](#B35)], we work with windows of sizes n = 1, 2, ... *nmax*, where *nmax* is a suitable upper limit. For each *n*, the scan statistic is computed and an associated p-value, p_n_, is obtained from permutation analysis. The smallest such p is then taken as the overall test statistic, for which an associated significance level, p_final_, is obtained from the permutation samples.

The burden test statistic is computed as follows. For a given window of size n, for each of cases and controls, we tally the number, *N* _1_, of individuals with a ‘1’ allele (at any of the *n* SNPs in the given window) and the number *N* _0_ of individuals without a ‘1’ allele, where ‘1’ is the minor allele and *‘*2’ is the major allele. Thus, each window furnishes a 2 × 2 table with rows corresponding to cases and controls, and columns referring to ‘1’ and not ‘1’ individuals. We define a one-sided test statistic – *g –* in the expectation that cases tend to more often carry a ‘1’ allele than controls. Thus, with χ^2^ obtained for the 2 × 2 table, *g* = √(χ^2^) if more cases than controls carry a ‘1’ allele, and *g* = -√(χ^2^) if more controls than cases carry a ‘1’ allele. We chose *nmax* = 3 as the upper window size in scan statistics.

## Results

Of the 152 SNPs genotyped in the selected genes, 19 variants were excluded due to the MAF < 0.05 and seven SNPs were excluded due to a call rate of less than 90%. The remaining 126 SNPs were analyzed for association with exposed but not opioid dependent use (NOD) and OD ([Supplementary Table 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2018-0137/suppl_file/pgs-20-331-s2.docx)). No SNP showed significant deviation from HWE in the control sample. LD analysis of the control sample revealed eight SNP pairs and one SNP triplet in complete LD (r^2^ = 1.0) as well as ten SNP pairs and two SNP triplets in strong linkage (r^2^ > 0.7) ([Supplementary Figure 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2018-0137/suppl_file/pgs-20-331-s1.docx)).

### Sample characteristics

Verification of the ancestry of all subjects using Structure analysis of the ancestry informative markers resulted in the exclusion of 19 subjects who described themselves as Caucasian but with a European ancestry contribution estimate of less than 70%. No evidence of population substructure was found within each study group, as described previously [[22](#B22)]. An additional 12 subjects were excluded from the association analyses due to low quantity or poor quality of the DNA sample ([Table 1](#T1)). The remaining 597 subjects were included in the association analyses.

### Single SNP analysis

Four independent group comparisons were performed under both dominant and recessive models of inheritance: HC versus NOD; NOD versus OD; HC versus OD and HC + NOD versus OD ([Table 3](#T3)). In total, 20 variants in six genes were shown to have nominally significant association of genotype with OD or NOD; including, variants in two serotonin receptor genes (*HTR3A* and *HTR3B)*, the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 gene *(SLC18A2)*, the S100 calcium binding protein A10 gene (*S100A10*), adrenergic receptor α-1A gene *(ADRA1A)* and the noradrenaline transporter gene (*SLC6A2*).

#### HC versus NOD

Individual SNP analysis revealed nominally significant associations for five variants in three genes, where the minor alleles were all associated with greater risk. Two intronic variants in *ADRA1A* – rs2036108 and rs2291776 – showed significant association (p_0_ = 0.032 and p_0_ = 0.046, respectively). Two SNPs in *HTR3B*, the upstream SNP rs3758987 and the intronic SNP rs11606194, displayed significant association (p_0_ = 0.020 and p_0_ = 0.031, respectively). The *SLC18A2* intronic variant rs363271 showed significant association (p_0_ = 0.034).

#### NOD versus OD

We found nominally significant association of genotype with OD for six SNPs in three genes, where the minor allele had a protective effect, except where noted. Three SNPs in *HTR3B*, displayed significant associations, including: rs3758987, rs11606194 and a nonsynonymous SNP, rs1176744 (Tyr129Ser; p_0_ = 0.005, p_0_ = 0.040 and p_0_ = 0.026, respectively). Two SNPs in *HTR3A*, the upstream variant rs1150226 and intronic variant rs2276302, were found to be significantly associated (p_0_ = 0.006 and p_0_ = 0.042, respectively). Intronic SNP rs363338 in *SLC18A2* showed significant association (p_0_ = 0.031), where in contrast the minor allele was associated with a risk effect.

#### HC versus OD

Seven SNPs in four genes showed nominal significance, where the minor allele contributed to a risk effect, unless otherwise noted. We found significant associations of four intronic SNPs in *ADRA1A*; including, rs475151, rs10503800, rs2036109 and rs2055195 (p_0_ = 0.003, p_0_ = 0.031, p_0_ = 0.020 and p_0_ = 0.031, respectively). The minor alleles for SNPs, rs2036109 and rs2055195, provided a protective effect. SNPs rs2036109 and rs2055195 are also in strong LD (r^2^ = 0.75). Three additional SNPs were found to be significantly associated with OD: an intronic variant in *SLC6A2*, rs3785143 (p_0_ = 0.016), 3’ UTR variant rs6587640 in the calcium binding protein gene *S100A10* (p_0_ = 0.032) and the *HTR3B* intronic variant rs3782025 (p_0_ = 0.040).

#### HC + NOD versus OD

Single SNP analysis revealed 11 SNPs in six genes with nominally significant association of genotype with OD, where the minor alleles showed a risk effect, unless otherwise noted. Three intronic *SLC18A2* SNPs, rs363338, rs363334 and rs363332 displayed significant signals (p_0_ = 0.009, 0.021 and 0.026, respectively). Three intronic *ADRA1A* SNPs, rs2036109, rs2055195 and rs472151 also showed significant association (p_0_ = 0.018, 0.021 and 0.028, respectively). Consistent with the finding for the comparison HC versus OD, having a minor allele for SNPs rs2036109 and rs2055195 would provide protection to individuals. Two intronic *S100A10* SNPs, rs3791153 and rs12083193 (both with p_0_ = 0.047) were also found to be significant. Finally, three SNPs: rs1150226 in *HTR3A*, rs1176744 in *HTR3B* and rs3785146 in *SLC6A2* were found to have a significant association of genotype with OD (p_0_ = 0.031, p_0_ = 0.040 and p_0_ = 0.038, respectively). The minor alleles of SNPs rs1150226 and rs1176744 provided greater protection.

### Gene-based analysis via scan statistics

For each of the four comparisons, [Table 4](#T4) shows scan statistics results with window sizes 1 to 3, where a window of size 1 refers to the best (most significant) SNP among all 126 SNPs analyzed in the sense that the given SNP exhibits the strongest difference between cases and controls for individuals carrying a minor allele. For each comparison, the overall significance level, p_final_, was smaller than the significance level for single SNPs, p_0_ (window length of one SNP), that is, burden test statistics comprising multiple contiguous SNPs appear more powerful than association tests based on individual SNPs. To obtain a result for the given comparison containing only SNPs in one gene, we carried out an analysis windows of sizes up to n*max* = 3. The strongest effect was obtained for the comparison HC + NOD versus OD with a window length of three SNPs that consisted of the *SLC18A2* SNPs, rs363338, rs363334 and rs363332 *(p* = 0.022). The three variants had a combined effect which remained significant after correction for testing multiple window sizes and multiple SNPs for the given comparison, with p_final_ = 0.047. These SNPs (rs363332, rs363334 and rs363338) were found to be in strong LD, r^2^ ranging from 0.78–0.98 ([Figure 1](#F0001)).

## Discussion

In this study, we analyzed 126 SNPs in 19 serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways genes for association with nondependent opioid use and/or heroin dependence. We found that 17 variants in six of the studied genes had nominally significant association of genotype with OD, and five variants in three genes had nominally significant association of genotype with NOD. The most significant result of the current study was revealed with a burden test that captures joint association effects of multiple contiguous SNPs. Specifically, for the comparison of HC + NOD versus OD using scan statistics, the strongest effect was found in *SLC18A2* and included SNPs rs363338, rs363334 and rs363332. The three SNPs had a combined effect that withstood correction for testing multiple SNPs and multiple window sizes.

### Serotoninergic genes

The *VMAT2* gene or *SLC18A2*: monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine are packaged into secretory vesicles by two different 12 transmembrane proteins known as VMATs, or vesicular monoamine transporters, which are part of a larger family of proteins called solute carriers (SLC) [[36](#B36)]. VMAT2, whose gene variants were indicated in the current study, is mainly confined to the central nervous system where it packages neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles [[37](#B37)]. It is an antiporter that uses a pH gradient to allow two protons to exit while simultaneously translocating a single monoamine molecule, like serotonin, into the vesicle [[38](#B38)]. The capacity of these transporters can be upwards of 20,000 molecules, orders of magnitude greater than cytosolic levels [[39](#B39)]. Three intronic *SLC18A2* SNPs (rs363338, rs363334 and rs363332) were implicated in the present study to be associated with OD, two of which (rs363332 and rs363334) are in remarkedly high LD and the third in moderate LD (rs363338). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of association of these SNPs with OD. In a prior study from this laboratory using an entirely separate study group [[40](#B40)] three different *SLC18A2* SNPs (rs363271, rs2244249 and rs363276) were found to offer protection from OD with or without cocaine comorbidity, of which one (rs363271) was also indicated in the present study, where the association found provided more risk for nondependent opioid use.

Several SNPs in *S100A10* were indicated in the present study. The protein product of *S100A10*, p11 was found to be an important factor mediating antidepressant responses and depression-like states in mice [[41](#B41)]. A study of cannabis dependence found a possible gene-cannabis interaction for *S100A10* rs72993629 [[42](#B42)], a variant which was not included in the present study. Of the three *S100A10* variants found to be associated with OD in the present study, the intronic SNPs rs3791153 and rs12083193 were previously reported by our laboratory using an entirely different study sample [[40](#B40)] to convey protection from cocaine dependence, where the minor allele provided protection from OD. For both studies, we found SNPs rs3791153 and rs12083193 to be in complete LD in the control sample. The third *S100A10* SNP indicated in the present study, rs6587640, is reported for the first time to be associated with drug addiction.

Variants in two serotonin receptor genes, *HTR3A* and *HTR3B*, were indicated in the present study. The two receptor genes reside in close proximity to one another on chromosome 11 [[43](#B43)]. In a multisite study, the A allele of an intronic *HTR3B* SNP, rs3782025, was associated with alcohol dependence in a Finnish sample [[44](#B44)]. Another study found that an *HTR3B* missense SNP, rs1176744 (Tyr129Ser), predicted alcohol dependence in an African–American population [[45](#B45)]. In an earlier study of an entirely different group of volunteers, our laboratory found a nominally significant association of the C allele of *HTR3B* rs3758987 with OD [[7](#B7)]. In a different study, Yang *et al*. [[46](#B46)] reported a haplotype of six *HTR3A* SNPs with an experiment-wise significant association with nicotine dependence in an African–American sample. Two of the SNPs in the haplotype, rs1150226 and rs2276302, were found associated with OD in the present study.

### Noradrenergic genes

We found six intronic variants in adrenoceptor α-1A gene (*ADRA1A*) to have significant associations; including rs2036109, rs2055195, rs10503800 and rs472151, which were found to be associated with OD and rs2036108 and rs2291776, found to be associated with NOD. SNP rs2036109 was previously associated with bipolar disorder in a family-based study [[47](#B47)]. In an earlier study of an entirely different cohort, we had shown that the three *ADRA1A* variants – rs10503800, rs472151 and rs2291776 – were associated with OD, with or without concomitant cocaine dependence in a European–American population [[40](#B40)]. Two *ADRA1A* SNPs, rs2036108 found associated with NOD and rs2055195 found associated with OD, had not previously been reported to be associated with OD.

Additionally, the intronic *SLC6A2* SNP, rs3785143, that the current study found associated with OD with the minor T allele conveying greater risk or vulnerability to develop OD, had previously been reported to be associated (point-wise significant) with methylphenidate response in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [[48](#B48)], as well as in a 2008 study, that found the variant to be nominally associated with ADHD [[49](#B49)].

## Limitations

The relatively small number of subjects in the current study may have limited detection of additional significant differences between groups. Further studies with greater statistical power are warranted to corroborate the results and to assess the clinical significance of the findings.

It is noteworthy; however, that although just one of the reported associations survived correction for multiple testing, many of the other results replicate earlier findings from our laboratory with entirely separate and distinct study populations.
