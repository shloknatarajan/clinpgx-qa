## Abstract

**Aim:** 
Therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus based on whole blood drug concentrations is routinely performed. The concentration of tacrolimus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) is likely to better reflect drug exposure at the treatment target site. We aimed to describe the relationship between tacrolimus whole blood and PBMC concentrations, and the influence of patient characteristics on this relationship by developing a population pharmacokinetic model.

**Methods:** 
We prospectively enrolled 63 stable adult kidney‐transplanted patients and collected dense (12‐h, n = 18) or sparse (4‐h, n = 45) pharmacokinetic profiles of tacrolimus. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood (Ficoll density gradient centrifugation), and drug concentrations in whole blood and PBMCs were analysed using liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry. Patient genotype (CYP3A4/5, ABCB1, NR1I2) was assessed with PCR. Population pharmacokinetic modelling and statistical evaluation was performed using NONMEM.

**Results:** 
Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations were well described using a two‐compartment pharmacokinetic model with a lag‐time and first‐order absorption and elimination. Tacrolimus PBMC concentrations were best estimated from whole blood concentrations with the use of a scaling factor, the ratio of whole blood to PBMC concentrations (R C:PBMC), which was the extent of tacrolimus distribution into PBMC. CYP3A5*1 non‐expressors and NR1I2‐25 385T allele expressors demonstrated higher R C:PBMC ratios of 42.4% and 60.7%, respectively.

**Conclusion:** 
Tacrolimus PBMC concentration could not be accurately predicted from whole blood concentrations and covariates because of significant residual unexplained variability in the distribution of tacrolimus into PBMCs and may need to be measured directly if required for future studies.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment modality for end‐stage kidney disease. To prevent graft rejections, kidney‐transplanted patients are treated with immunosuppressive drugs, often [tacrolimus](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=6784), throughout the lifespan of their transplanted organ. Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index and displays large interindividual variability (IIV) in its pharmacokinetics (PKs).[1](#bcp16277-bib-0001), [2](#bcp16277-bib-0002), [3](#bcp16277-bib-0003) This makes it a suitable agent for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), but finding the optimal dosing is difficult because drug toxicity and graft rejection still occur in patients with whole blood drug levels in the established concentration range. This may be explained by a suboptimal correlation between tacrolimus pre‐dose concentrations and efficacy and adverse events.[4](#bcp16277-bib-0004), [5](#bcp16277-bib-0005), [6](#bcp16277-bib-0006) Tacrolimus is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes pre‐systemic metabolism by CYP3A4/5 isoenzymes[2](#bcp16277-bib-0002), [7](#bcp16277-bib-0007), [8](#bcp16277-bib-0008) and is a substrate of the efflux pump p‐glycoprotein ([P‐gp](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=768)),[7](#bcp16277-bib-0007), [9](#bcp16277-bib-0009), [10](#bcp16277-bib-0010), [11](#bcp16277-bib-0011) both of these processes contribute to its low and variable bioavailability (mean 25%).[1](#bcp16277-bib-0001), [2](#bcp16277-bib-0002) Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding CYP3A4/5 (ie, *CYP3A4*22*, *CYP3A5*3*) and Pg‐p (*ABCB1 1236C>T*, *2677G>T* and *3435C>T*) have been suggested to influence the PK variability.[9](#bcp16277-bib-0009), [10](#bcp16277-bib-0010), [12](#bcp16277-bib-0012), [13](#bcp16277-bib-0013), [14](#bcp16277-bib-0014), [15](#bcp16277-bib-0015), [16](#bcp16277-bib-0016) CYP3A4/5 and Pg‐p are both regulated by the pregnane x receptor ([PXR](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=606)).[17](#bcp16277-bib-0017) SNPs in PXR (*NR1I2 25385C>T* and *‐24384A>T*) have also been suggested to influence the PK variability.[18](#bcp16277-bib-0018), [19](#bcp16277-bib-0019) Tacrolimus is bound extensively in erythrocytes and to plasma proteins such as albumin,[2](#bcp16277-bib-0002), [20](#bcp16277-bib-0020) and ~80% of tacrolimus in the body is found in the erythrocytes.[21](#bcp16277-bib-0021) Factors that have been reported to influence the PK of tacrolimus include patient weight, age, genotype, time after transplantation, haematocrit and albumin concentration, and drug‐drug interactions.[2](#bcp16277-bib-0002), [22](#bcp16277-bib-0022)

It is possible to measure the tacrolimus concentration close to the active site in lymphocytes. Only around 1% of the total tacrolimus in the body is found in the lymphocytes.[21](#bcp16277-bib-0021) Methods to quantify tacrolimus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been developed previously.[23](#bcp16277-bib-0023), [24](#bcp16277-bib-0024), [25](#bcp16277-bib-0025), [26](#bcp16277-bib-0026) PBMCs are a blood fraction mostly consisting of lymphocytes that is easy to obtain and only requires drawing of small blood volumes.[27](#bcp16277-bib-0027) Tacrolimus PBMC concentrations correlate with inhibition of calcineurin activity ex vivo[28](#bcp16277-bib-0028) and have also been reported to correlate with immunologic response in kidney‐transplanted patients,[29](#bcp16277-bib-0029) and with histological grading of rejections in liver‐transplanted patients.[30](#bcp16277-bib-0030) However, a correlation between tacrolimus PBMC concentrations and clinical outcomes is yet to be established.

Whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus have been reported to correlate poorly with PBMC concentrations based on linear regression.[26](#bcp16277-bib-0026), [30](#bcp16277-bib-0030), [31](#bcp16277-bib-0031), [32](#bcp16277-bib-0032), [33](#bcp16277-bib-0033) It is possible that a more intricate relationship between the two exists that may be explained by accounting for interindividual differences in drug distribution into the PBMC. A population modelling approach could be used to explore this relationship. Population PK modelling offers the possibility of separately estimating typical population values for PK parameters, IIV, and unexplained residual error (RUV) within the model, and the influence of covariates on PK parameters can be assessed to explain IIV. Several population PK models of tacrolimus in whole blood have been published,[22](#bcp16277-bib-0022) but to our knowledge the relationship between whole blood and PBMC concentrations of tacrolimus has only been explored once using a population approach.[34](#bcp16277-bib-0034) Here, Franken et al reported that the distribution of tacrolimus between whole blood and PBMCs was instantaneous. This study was based on measurement of tacrolimus concentration in PBMC from trough samples only and involved newly transplanted patients only. It is desirable to investigate the distribution of tacrolimus to PBMCs with longitudinal measurements of whole blood and PBMC concentrations in a population of stable kidney‐transplanted patients.

We aimed to characterize the relationship between tacrolimus whole blood and PBMC concentrations in stable adult kidney transplant recipients and the influence of patient characteristics on this relationship by developing a population PK model. We hypothesised that PBMC concentrations can be predicted solely from whole blood concentrations and significant patient characteristics.

## 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

### 2.1. Patients and study design

In this observational cohort study, we prospectively recruited adult kidney transplant recipients from three nephrology departments in Odense, Esbjerg and Kolding, Denmark between June 2021 and October 2023. Eligibility criteria included an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of immediate‐release tacrolimus twice daily (b.i.d.), and mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid b.i.d., subject age ≥18 years, stable graft function (≥3 months post transplantation) and stable immunosuppressive treatment (no dose adjustments in the past 5 days). Exclusion criteria were anaemia (haemoglobin <6 mmol/L) or inability to consent to the study. Patients were asked to participate on one occasion in either a densely or sparsely sampled group. We collected four (predose, 0.5, 1.5 and 4 h postdose) or 11 (predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h postdose) blood samples from the sparsely and densely sampled patients, respectively.

The study was approved by the Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern Denmark (J.no.: 20/53093, date: January 2021), and was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before enrolling in the study.

Data collection from medical charts is described in the Supporting Information. Lean body weight (LBW) was calculated using the Boers formula.[35](#bcp16277-bib-0035) We also identified concomitantly administered drugs that could potentially interact with tacrolimus based on evidence from three databases (interaktionsdatabasen.dk (Sep‐23), interaksjoner.no (Sep‐23), and [medicinescomplete.com](http://medicinescomplete.com) (Oct‐23)).

### 2.2. Isolation of PBMCs

PBMCs were isolated from whole blood collected in EDTA tubes using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. We diluted 3 mL of the blood sample in 3 mL of phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) and gently layered the diluted blood on top of 3 mL of Ficoll‐Paque Plus (GE Healthcare BioSciences AB) in a 15‐mL Falcon tube. The samples were low‐speed centrifugated (30 min, 400 g, 20 °C, brakes off). The PBMC layer was collected into a clean 15‐mL Falcon tube and washed twice in 5 mL of PBS followed by centrifugation (10 min, 400 g, 20 °C). The white pellet was suspended in 1000 μL of PBS, and two samples of 450 μL were aliquoted into cryogenic vials and centrifugated (2 min, 2350 g, 20 °C). The remaining suspended cells were saved for cell counting: The supernatant suspended cells were removed, and the pellet was stored in cryogenic vials at −80 °C until further analysis. An aliquot of 10 μL of suspended cells were stained with 10 μL of trypan blue and counted in duplicate using a particle size range of 5‐15 μm (Countess II, Thermo Scientific). The mean cell counts and mean corpuscular volume of PBMCs[36](#bcp16277-bib-0036) were used for calculation of PBMC concentration. We examined the redness of the pellet and marked samples that had a considerable red colour.

### 2.3. Analytical method for tacrolimus concentrations

Tacrolimus concentrations were measured in whole blood and PBMC using a validated liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) method with sample preparation according to the methods described by Liu et al[37](#bcp16277-bib-0037) and Pensi et al.[24](#bcp16277-bib-0024) Details of the analytical method are described in the Supporting Information. Between‐batch reproducibility and within‐batch precision were <10.0% and <10.6%, respectively, in whole blood, and <7.7% and <4.8%, respectively, in PBMC cells. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.20 ng/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.06 ng/mL for both media.

### 2.4. Genotyping

EDTA whole blood was centrifuged (15 min, 1500 g, 20 °C), and the buffy coat was removed and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from 50 μL of the buffy coat dissolved in 250 μL of DNAse‐free water on a Microlab STARlet (Hamilton Company) using a STARMag Universal Cartridge isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA concentration was measured with a Qubit 4 Fluorometer and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Scientific), and DNA was diluted in DNAse‐free water to a final concentration of 4.5 ng/μL. The diluted samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis.

Patient genotypes were determined for SNPs *ABCB1* (*1236C>T* (rs1128503), *2677G>T* (rs2032582) and *3435C>T* (rs1045642)), *CYP3A5* (**1/*3*, rs776746), *CYP3A4* (**22*, rs35599367), *NR1I2* (*‐25385C>T* (rs3814055) and *‐24384A>T* (rs1523127). A TaqMan genotyping assay (Thermo Scientific) on a CFX96 thermocycler (Bio‐Rad Laboratories) was applied according to the manufacturer's protocol.

### 2.5. Statistical analysis and population PK modelling

Statistical analysis, data management and graphics were performed in R Statistical Software (version 4.3.0, R Core Team 2022). Patient demographics were presented as percentages or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). The Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium was tested with a Pearson's *χ* ^2^ test statistic. The Pearson coefficient of determination was used to assess linearity between whole blood and PBMC concentrations. A *P* value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. We did not perform a sample size calculation before patient enrolment, but aimed at a sample size equivalent to previous tacrolimus population PK models (median 69 patients, range 12‐681).[22](#bcp16277-bib-0022)

Population PK modelling using non‐linear mixed‐effect models was performed in NONMEM (version 7.1.2.; ICON Development Solutions)[38](#bcp16277-bib-0038) using the first‐order conditional estimation with interaction approximation method and the ADVAN13 as the equation solver. PsN (version 5.3.1)[39](#bcp16277-bib-0039) was used for model selection and diagnostics. Firstly, we developed a model to describe the PK of tacrolimus in whole blood, achieving steady state through repeated doses for at least 15 days of twice‐daily dosing the same dose. We fitted tacrolimus whole blood concentration‐time data to a two‐compartment model with linear elimination as informed by previously published PK models of tacrolimus. In a two‐compartment model, estimated PK parameters are the apparent oral clearance (CL/*F*), the apparent oral central volume of distribution (*V* _C_/*F*), the apparent oral intercompartmental clearance (*Q*/*F*) and the apparent oral peripheral volume of distribution (*V* _P_/*F*). We investigated mainly the absorption with lag or transit compartment models as well as the stochastic part of the model where IIV in the PK parameters was assumed to be log‐normally distributed. We tested proportional, a combined additive and proportional, and IIV in the error models for RUV in our models. After identifying a suitable PK model to characterize tacrolimus whole blood concentrations, corresponding intracellular concentrations were modelled as a peripheral compartment without mass transfer from the central concentrations, where the rate (*K* _C‐PBMC_) and extent of distribution (*R* _C:PBMC_) were investigated (Equation [1](#bcp16277-disp-0001)).

| dCPBMCdt=KC−PBMC×RC:PBMC×ACVC/F−CPBMC | (1) |
| --- | --- |
where *A* _C_ is the amount of tacrolimus in the central compartment, *V* _C_/*F* is the apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment and *C* _PBMC_ is the concentration of tacrolimus in the PBMC compartment. Several implementations of the extent were explored, including saturable in‐ and efflux.

### 2.6. Covariate analysis

Covariates were selected for screening based on their known relationship with tacrolimus PKs and theoretical plausibility. Selected covariates relationships included age, sex and LBW on all parameters; haematocrit, albumin, genetic polymorphisms (*CYP3A5*1/*3*, *CYP3A4*22*, *ABCB1*(*1236C>T*, *2677G>T* and *3435C>T*), *NR1I2* (*‐25385C>T* and *‐24381A>T*)) on CL/*F*, *V* _C_/*F* and *R* _C:PBMC_; and alanine transaminase, bilirubin and potentially interacting comedication (glucocorticoids, calcium channel blockers and proton pump inhibitors) on CL/*F*. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in *CYP3A5*1/*3* and *ABCB1* (*1236C>T* and *2677G>T)* were investigated on bioavailability. Time since transplantation was investigated on all parameters except bioavailability. Potentially important covariate relationships were identified with statistical evaluation in NONMEM using a stepwise forward inclusion step (*P* < .05) followed by backward elimination (*P* < .001). Continuous covariates were normalized to population median values and were tested as linear, exponential and power model functions on selected parameters. Categorical covariates were tested as shifts relative to the mode of the covariate. Genotype variants were tested as recessive or dominant (where possible) mutations as well as assuming the additive genetic model. Missing covariates were implemented as the mode or median of the covariate for categorical and continuous covariates, respectively.

### 2.7. Model selection, evaluation and simulations

Model evaluation and selection were based on minimizing the −2log likelihood, the objective function value (OFV). A decrease in the OFV of 3.84 (*P* = .05, *χ* ^2^ distribution, 1 degree of freedom [1df]) between two hierarchical models was considered statistically significant. The predictive performance of the alternative models was evaluated with prediction‐corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPCs) using 500 simulations, assessing a reduced prediction interval (10th and 90th percentiles) due to the rather limited population size. Uncertainty associated with the parameters of the final model was evaluated using the sampling importance resampling method, and the precision of each parameter was reported as the relative standard error (RSE). Simulations were performed based on the final model to evaluate the influence of covariate relationships with all parameters (both typical value and IIV) fixed. For continuous covariates, simulations were performed for the values of the IQRs of the covariate in the population. The simulation results are presented as medians and 95% confidence intervals.

## 3. RESULTS

### 3.1. Patient demographics

Tacrolimus PK data were obtained from 63 stable adult kidney transplant patients. The densely and sparsely sampled groups comprised 18 and 45 patients, respectively. All participants received an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of immediate‐release tacrolimus b.i.d. and mycophenolate b.i.d. (mofetil or enteric‐coated mycophenolic acid). Two patients were treated with mycophenolate mofetil once or twice daily, and 19% of the participants received corticosteroids in addition. A whole blood tacrolimus trough concentration of 5 ng/mL was generally targeted in these patients. Median age, body mass index and serum creatinine were 59 years (IQR 48‐68 years), 26.7 kg/m^2^ (IQR 23.8‐30.4 kg/m^2^) and 129 μmol/L (104‐168 μmol/L), respectively. Median time since transplantation was 38 months (IQR 15‐79 months) and 85.7% of the patients were first‐time kidney transplant recipients. Of the 63 enrolled patients, 17.5% were carriers of at least one *CYP3A5*1* allele. All SNPs were in the Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium except *NR1I2‐25385C>T* (*P* = 0.04).

### 3.2. Population PK analysis

A total of 366 whole blood and 348 PBMC concentration‐time measurements were included in the population PK analysis. Based on a linear regression accounting for IIV (ie, a linear mixed‐effects model), correlation between whole blood and PBMC was statistically significant (*R* ^2^ = 0.63, *P* < .001), although considerable IIV was present (Figure [1](#bcp16277-fig-0001)). Erythrocyte contamination did not explain why some PBMC concentrations were low with high whole blood concentrations (red dots).

### FIGURE 1.

![FIGURE 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/35fb/11862786/4130494d24ab/BCP-91-761-g005.jpg)

Tacrolimus whole blood vs PBMC concentration in 63 kidney transplanted patients (R 2 = 0.63, P < 0.001). Orange dots, significant erythrocyte contamination; green dots, no significant erythrocyte contamination.

Tacrolimus whole blood concentration‐time data were best described with a two‐compartment disposition model with first‐order absorption and first‐order elimination with an absorption lag‐time. The bioavailability (*F*) was fixed to 1 to allow estimation of IIV in *F*. Thus, the apparent (or relative) *F* propagates to all disposition parameters. Tacrolimus PBMC concentration‐time data were predicted from whole blood concentration‐time profiles. Tacrolimus distribution rate into PBMCs was instantaneous, and we estimated only the extent of distribution as a ratio of tacrolimus whole blood to PBMC concentration (R_C:PBMC_) (Figure [2](#bcp16277-fig-0002)). The ratio *R* _C:PBMC_ had a skewed distribution of IIV, so the distribution was boxcox transformed, estimating the skewness. The distribution into PBMC was modelled as in Equation [2](#bcp16277-disp-0002).

Population pharmacokinetic model structure of the disposition of tacrolimus with a central, peripheral and intracellular compartment. CL, clearance; K C‐PBMC, distribution rate constant from central compartment to PBMCs; MTT, mean transit time; R C:PBMC, extent of tacrolimus distribution into PBMC; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; Q, intercompartmental clearance; V C, central volume of distribution; V P, peripheral volume of distribution.

Non‐linearity, such as saturable in‐ or efflux of tacrolimus, was investigated using *E* _max_ and *I* _max_ models. To further explore non‐linearity a power models was tested. However, none of the investigated relationships provided statistically significantly better fit over the linear. The ratio *R* _C:PBMC_ was adjusted with a dilution factor if PBMC samples had a significant red colour. Red PBMC samples (n = 23) had a lower *R* _C:PBMC_ (70.9% of *R* _C:PBMC_ without redness). Final parameter estimates are displayed in Table [2](#bcp16277-tbl-0002). Two patients had their tacrolimus dosage adjusted soon before their blood sampling occasion (ie, <5 days earlier). We recorded when and how their treatment was adjusted and assumed they were at steady state before dose adjustment, and that they had consistently taken the same tacrolimus dosage every 12 h since the dose adjustment.

### 3.3. Covariate analysis

Covariates included in the final model are displayed in Supporting Information Table [SS1](#bcp16277-supitem-0001). Haematocrit significantly influenced tacrolimus clearance in the forward inclusion step but not after backwards elimination, so it was excluded in the final model. *CYP3A5* non‐expressors had lower tacrolimus clearance and a higher *R* _C:PBMC_ value (Table [2](#bcp16277-tbl-0002)). Patients homozygous for the *NR1I2‐25385C>T* gene variant had a higher *R* _C:PBMC_ value. Tacrolimus bioavailability increased with patient age, and men had higher *V* _C_ values than women. Gene variants were treated as recessive mutations because (a) no better fit was seen with the additive genetic model, (b) the frequency of *CYP3A5* expressors was low (n = 1) and (c) pooling homozygous and heterozygous *NR1I2‐25385C>T* mutant type resulted in a worse fit (∆OFV = 9.73). Including covariates on *R* _C:PBMC_ accounted for 14% of the unexplained variability, reducing the IIV of *R* _C:PBMC_ from 51.5% to 37.8%.

### 3.4. Model evaluation and simulations

The pcVPCs based on the full model showed good predictive performance in terms of characterizing both the central and the PBMC compartment concentrations (Figure [3A,B](#bcp16277-fig-0003)). The median observed concentration was close to the median predicted concentration when considering both whole blood and PBMC measurements. Observed concentrations fell mostly within the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the simulated 10th to 90th percentiles. The 95% CI of the predicted concentrations based on the full model were slightly narrower than a model without covariates (Supporting Information Figure [SS1](#bcp16277-supitem-0001)). A worse fit between observed and predicted concentrations was visible when model predictions were based on population models by Franken et al[34](#bcp16277-bib-0034) and Andrews et al[40](#bcp16277-bib-0040) compared to our final model (Figure [3C,D](#bcp16277-fig-0003)) with underprediction of whole blood concentrations and overprediction of PBMC concentrations. Figure [4](#bcp16277-fig-0004) illustrates the covariate relationships of age on *F*, sex on *V* _C_/*F*, *CYP3A5* genotype on CL/*F* and *CYP3A5* and *NR1I2*‐*25385C>T* genotype on *R* _C:PBMC._ Simulations that demonstrated the influence of various combinations of covariates on whole blood and PBMC concentration‐time profiles (Figure [5](#bcp16277-fig-0005)) suggested that the *CYP3A5*1* and *NR1I2‐25385C>T* gene variants in combination with sex were the covariates that had the greatest influence on both whole blood and the PBMC concentrations.

## 4. DISCUSSION

We developed a population PK model that for the first time describes the relationship between whole blood and PBMC concentrations of tacrolimus in stable kidney‐transplanted patients. A two‐compartment PK model with a lag‐time and first‐order absorption and elimination best described the PK of tacrolimus in whole blood in our population. Equilibrium between the central and PBMC compartment was reached instantaneously, and the correlation between the two was linear. Patient *CYP3A5*1* genotype, age and sex influenced the PKs of tacrolimus in whole blood, and patient *CYP3A5*1* and *NR1I2‐25385C>T* genotype influenced tacrolimus distribution into PBMCs.

Today, tacrolimus TDM is performed using whole blood concentrations, but these concentrations are not fully predictive of clinical outcomes in kidney‐transplanted patients. PBMC tacrolimus concentration is suggested as a more appropriate matrix for TDM as it approximately reflects the concentration at the site where tacrolimus exerts its function. If PBMC tacrolimus concentration is better linked to clinical outcome, being able to predict the PBMC tacrolimus concentration would be highly desirable.

Our model structure was similar to one developed for newly kidney transplanted patients by Franken et al.[34](#bcp16277-bib-0034) However, we collected whole blood and PBMC samples based on both predose and repeated postdose tacrolimus administration, so if a delay existed in the distribution of tacrolimus from whole blood to PBMCs, we would have been able to better characterize it.[41](#bcp16277-bib-0041) Using the final model with covariates, we were able to adequately predict whole blood and PBMC concentrations of tacrolimus in our study population (Figure [3A,B](#bcp16277-fig-0003)). Notably, our model better fitted our data than previous models by Franken et al[34](#bcp16277-bib-0034) and Andrews et al[40](#bcp16277-bib-0040) (Figure [3C,D](#bcp16277-fig-0003)).

The apparent bioavailability of tacrolimus was found to increase with age (Table [2](#bcp16277-tbl-0002) and Figure [4A](#bcp16277-fig-0004)). The first‐pass metabolism of tacrolimus may decrease with increasing age due to reduction in metabolic enzyme or efflux transporter activity. However, the simulated whole blood and PBMC concentrations were almost identical between a young (31 years) and an older (75 years) patient (Figure [5B](#bcp16277-fig-0005)), so it appears to have little bearing on the concentrations of tacrolimus in PBMCs. We also found an effect of sex, as women have a 34.5% lower apparent oral *V* _C_ than men (Table [2](#bcp16277-tbl-0002) and Figure [4B](#bcp16277-fig-0004)). Simulated whole blood and PBMC concentrations only differed slightly between men and women (Figure [5A](#bcp16277-fig-0005)). We tested if sex could be replaced by measurements of size (ie, body weight, LBW) as covariate since men are generally larger than women, but this resulted in a worse fit with our data. The clinical implication of this covariate is questionable.

*CYP3A5* non‐expressors had a 46.6% lower CL/*F* than expressors (Table [2](#bcp16277-tbl-0002)), which is in line with multiple previous models.[22](#bcp16277-bib-0022), [40](#bcp16277-bib-0040) Additionally, *CYP3A5* non‐expressors had a 42.4% higher *R* _C:PBMC_ than expressors, so the difference in PBMC concentrations between an expressor and a non‐expressor is even greater than the difference in whole blood concentrations (Figure [5D](#bcp16277-fig-0005)). Interestingly, patients homozygous for the *NR1I2‐25 385T* allele had 60.7% higher *R* _C:PBMC_ than carriers of the *C* allele (Table [2](#bcp16277-tbl-0002) and Figure [4D](#bcp16277-fig-0004)). These patients have decreased liver levels of PXR protein,[17](#bcp16277-bib-0017) so they were expected to have a lower CYP3A4/5 and Pg‐p mediated CL. In accordance, Benkali et al[18](#bcp16277-bib-0018) found a 1.5‐fold higher clearance in *NR1I2‐25 385 TT* genotype compared to the CC genotype. We could not replicate the findings by Benkali et al[18](#bcp16277-bib-0018) because only PBMC concentrations were affected by this SNP (Figure [5C](#bcp16277-fig-0005)). Interestingly, we have previously found a relationship between a person's *NR112* genotype and human polyomavirus 1 (BK viremia).[19](#bcp16277-bib-0019) The association of the *NR1I2 8055C>T* polymorphism with BK viraemia suggested clinically significant overimmunosuppression in individuals with the variant allele. The influence of *NR1I2* polymorphisms on the distribution to PBMCs should be further investigated.

Tacrolimus PBMC concentration could not be accurately predicted from whole blood concentrations and covariates because of larger unexplained interindividual variability in the distribution of tacrolimus into PBMCs and may need to be measured directly if required for future studies. This suggests that there might be other covariates that influence the relationship.

The most important strength of our study is the use of a population PK modelling approach to analyse the correlation between whole blood and PBMC concentrations. Modelling does not require a uniform patient population and allows for variable drug concentration sampling schemes, so it is possible to describe the PK in a diverse population of kidney transplanted patients. The population PK modelling was based on both pre‐ and postdose samples, so we were able to better estimate the rate of distribution into the intracellular compartment. It is a major strength of the study that drug concentrations were analysed both in whole blood and PBMC using LC‐MS/MS and not the less sensitive and less selective immunoassays.[3](#bcp16277-bib-0003), [42](#bcp16277-bib-0042) The immunoassays tend to overestimate tacrolimus concentrations due to cross‐reaction with tacrolimus metabolites[3](#bcp16277-bib-0003), [43](#bcp16277-bib-0043) or interference from albumin or haematocrit.[44](#bcp16277-bib-0044)

We did not include a lysis step to avoid erythrocyte contamination when we isolated PBMCs, which has been suggested by several groups.[24](#bcp16277-bib-0024), [25](#bcp16277-bib-0025), [34](#bcp16277-bib-0034), [45](#bcp16277-bib-0045) Tacrolimus distributes to erythrocytes, so the measured concentration may reflect the tacrolimus available both in erythrocytes and lymphocytes. We chose not to include a lysis step in our protocol to reduce the protocol complexity and isolation time, so it was feasible to prepare PBMC samples also in the densely sampled patients. Instead, we added a dilution factor on the *R* _C:PBMC_ to adjust the ratio for the PBMC samples that were considerably contaminated with erythrocytes. We saw that the *R* _C:PBMC_ was 70.8% lower in the samples that were contaminated, so the PBMC tacrolimus concentrations were lower. Thus, significant erythrocyte contamination diluted the PBMC concentrations. We did not add a P‐gp inhibitor on PBMC isolation to prevent active transport out of the cells as suggested by Udomkarnjananun et al.[46](#bcp16277-bib-0046) We suggest that some residual variability may be reduced if the analytical method is refined. An additional limitation is that we only sampled the patients on one occasion, so we were not able to the capture inter‐occasion variability (IOV) of *R* _C:PBMC_ with the model. An important prerequisite to select a new matrix for TDM (such as the *R* _C:PBMC_) is that the parameter is predictable and less varying (ie, low IOV).[47](#bcp16277-bib-0047)

In conclusion, our population PK model described the distribution of tacrolimus from a central compartment to PBMCs in 63 stable kidney transplanted patients. *CYP3A5* and *NR1I2‐25385C>T* genetic variants significantly influenced the distribution to the PBMCs. PBMC tacrolimus concentrations could not be predicted adequately from whole blood concentrations and covariates alone because the interindividual variability of PBMC concentrations was substantial. Future studies are needed to identify any links between PBMC tacrolimus exposure and patient outcomes, to identify other covariates that might cause substantial variability in distribution into PBMCs, and to refine the analytical method.
