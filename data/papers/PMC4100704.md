## Abstract

**Objectives:** 
Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-1 infection. Three polymorphisms in CYP2B6 define plasma efavirenz trough concentration strata that vary across an ∼10-fold range. We characterized associations between human genetic polymorphisms and virologic response among participants who received efavirenz-containing regimens in a prospective clinical trial.

**Methods:** 
We genotyped 76 polymorphisms in CYP2B6 (including those that define efavirenz concentration strata), CYP2A6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 and week 48 virologic responses in 360 Haitians who initiated efavirenz-containing regimens in protocol HT 001. Associations were characterized by logistic regression analysis and Fisher's exact test.

**Results:** 
Proportions with HIV-1 RNA <50 or <200 copies/mL did not differ across 10 CYP2B6 metabolizer strata. In analyses that combined strata into three metabolizer levels (extensive, intermediate and slow), the respective proportions were 0.79, 0.79 and 0.81 (<50 copies/mL cut-off) and 0.84, 0.86 and 0.87 (<200 copies/mL cut-off). Genetic associations were not identified after controlling for baseline variables or with other polymorphisms after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

**Conclusions:** 
Virologic failures in HT 001 were not explained by genetic polymorphisms known to define the lowest plasma efavirenz concentration stratum.

### Objectives

Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-1 infection. Three polymorphisms in *CYP2B6* define plasma efavirenz trough concentration strata that vary across an ∼10-fold range. We characterized associations between human genetic polymorphisms and virologic response among participants who received efavirenz-containing regimens in a prospective clinical trial.

### Methods

We genotyped 76 polymorphisms in *CYP2B6* (including those that define efavirenz concentration strata), *CYP2A6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5* and *ABCB1* and week 48 virologic responses in 360 Haitians who initiated efavirenz-containing regimens in protocol HT 001. Associations were characterized by logistic regression analysis and Fisher's exact test.

### Results

Proportions with HIV-1 RNA <50 or <200 copies/mL did not differ across 10 *CYP2B6* metabolizer strata. In analyses that combined strata into three metabolizer levels (extensive, intermediate and slow), the respective proportions were 0.79, 0.79 and 0.81 (<50 copies/mL cut-off) and 0.84, 0.86 and 0.87 (<200 copies/mL cut-off). Genetic associations were not identified after controlling for baseline variables or with other polymorphisms after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

### Conclusions

Virologic failures in HT 001 were not explained by genetic polymorphisms known to define the lowest plasma efavirenz concentration stratum.

## Introduction

Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-1 infection. Three *CYP2B6* polymorphisms predict increased plasma efavirenz exposure: G516T (rs3745274),^1,2^ T983C (rs28399499)^3–5^ and C15582T (rs4803419).^5^ Plasma *C*_min_ concentration strata defined by these polymorphisms vary across an ∼10-fold range.^5^ Homozygosity for *CYP2B6* 15582 CC, 516 GG and 983 TT predict the lowest stratum, but C15582T does not contribute to the highest strata, which are largely explained by G516T and T983C.^5^

Previous reports suggest that *CYP2B6* polymorphisms may affect treatment response. In AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocols, an association was suggested between the *CYP2B6* composite 516/983 extensive metabolizer genotype and increased virologic failure among black subjects, but not among white or Hispanic subjects.^4^ A subsequent Swiss HIV Cohort Study report (∼80% Caucasians) suggested that *CYP2B6* polymorphisms did not predict efavirenz discontinuation, although the risk may have been increased with various combinations of *CYP2B6*, *CYP2A6* and *CYP3A4* polymorphisms.^6^

Until 2012, WHO guidelines had recommended initiating antiretroviral therapy at ≤200 CD4 cells/mm^3^ or with clinical AIDS. Randomized clinical trial HT 001, performed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, demonstrated that earlier therapy initiation decreased rates of death and incident tuberculosis,^7^ which affected treatment guidelines.^8^ The present study determined whether polymorphisms in *CYP2B6* and/or other genes predicted virologic failure in HT 001.

## Patients and methods

Protocol HT 001 (ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT00120510](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00120510))^7^ was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial of early versus standard timing for initiation of antiretroviral therapy among adults with between 200 and 350 CD4 cells/mm^3^. The study was conducted at the centre of the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO). Participants were randomized 1 : 1 to early or standard timing for treatment initiation with fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine (every 12 h) plus efavirenz (600 mg every 24 h, at bedtime). Informed consent was required from participants before study entry. The early group began treatment within 2 weeks after enrolment. For the first 2 months, a field worker observed the morning dose. Participants in the standard group started therapy for any CD4 count ≤200 cells/mm^3^ or for any AIDS-defining illness. A total of 816 participants (408 per arm) were followed for a median of 21 months.

Laboratory results included CD4 counts at baseline and at least every 6 months. Complete blood counts and serum chemistries were obtained every 3 months for participants receiving antiretroviral drugs. Plasma specimens obtained at enrolment and every 48 weeks were cryopreserved until HT 001 was completed and were then assayed for HIV-1 RNA using NucliSENS EasyQ^®^ (bioMérieux, Paris, France). Participants were given the option to consent for pharmacogenomic analyses. The present analyses are based on the clinical data available when the dataset was closed for primary analysis.^7^

Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva. A total of 76 polymorphisms (49 in *CYP2B6*, 22 in *CYP2A6*, 1 in *CYP3A4*, 1 in *CYP3A5* and 3 in *ABCB1*) were assayed using MassARRAY^®^ iPLEX Gold (Sequenom). The assay design is described elsewhere.^9^ Polymorphisms with missingness >5% or minor allele frequencies <5% were excluded, as were samples with genotyping failure >2%. Each polymorphism was in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Associations with each of 10 *CYP2B6* metabolizer strata were assessed with Fisher's exact test. Other associations were assessed by logistic regression. Associations with *CYP2B6* polymorphisms known to predict efavirenz plasma concentrations were not corrected for multiple comparisons, because their pharmacokinetic associations are so well established. This use of DNA was approved by institutional review boards at Weill Cornell Medical College, GHESKIO and Vanderbilt. The former two boards approved HT 001 and its informed consent document.

## Results

Of 816 subjects in HT 001, 387 initiated antiretroviral therapy and had ≥12 months of follow-up (327 in the early group and 60 in the standard group)^7^ and 636 had evaluable genotype data. Pharmacogenomic association analyses are based on 360 individuals who initiated 600 mg of efavirenz once daily, had no regimen change (including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) before week 48 and had HIV-1 RNA data available at weeks 0 and 48. Among these subjects, 211 (58.6%) were female. At week 0, the median age was 40.6 years (IQR 32.9–47.0 years) and the median CD4 count was 260 cells/mm^3^ (IQR 214–301 cells/mm^3^), closely reflecting the larger HT 001 cohort.^7^ Minor allele frequencies of the 76 polymorphisms and *CYP2B6* metabolizer strata did not differ significantly between the subjects included in genetic association analyses and the other 276 subjects (data not shown). At week 0 in the 360 subjects, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.0 log_10_ copies/mL (IQR 4.5–5.4 log_10_ copies/mL). At week 48, plasma HIV-1 RNA was <50 copies/mL in 287 subjects (79.7%) and <200 copies/mL in 308 (85.6%). Only 14 subjects permanently discontinued efavirenz within 48 weeks, almost all unrelated to study drug.

Each subject was assigned to 1 of 10 *CYP2B6* metabolizer strata based on *CYP2B6* genotypes. There was no significant association between any stratum and the likelihood of week 48 HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (Figure [1](#DKU088F1)a) or <200 copies/mL (Figure [1](#DKU088F1)b, *P *> 0.05 for each comparison). Additional analyses considered combined strata: extensive metabolizer = lowest two strata; intermediate extensive = middle five strata; and slow metabolizer = highest three strata, which generally reflects groupings in prior studies based solely on *CYP2B6* G516T and T983C. There was no significant association between combined *CYP2B6* strata and the likelihood of week 48 HIV-1 RNA <50 or <200 copies/mL (Figure [1](#DKU088F1)c, *P* > 0.05 for each comparison).

Genetic associations with virologic response were further tested in multivariable analyses that controlled for baseline log_10_ HIV-1 RNA, sex, age and baseline CD4 count. There was again no significant association between combined *CYP2B6* strata and the likelihood of week 48 HIV-1 RNA <50 or <200 copies/mL (Table [1](#DKU088TB1)).

Additional analyses explored associations beyond *CYP2B6* C15582T, G516T and T983C. By univariate logistic regression analysis, there was no association between any of the 76 polymorphisms and the likelihood of week 48 HIV-1 RNA <50 or <200 copies/mL, at a Bonferroni-corrected *P* value threshold of *P* = 0.0007 (data not shown). The lowest *P* value was for *CYP3A4* rs2740574 for <50 copies/mL (OR = 0.53, *P* = 0.0016) and *CYP2A6* rs28399433 for <200 copies/mL (OR = 0.42, *P* = 0.0045). The results for all 76 polymorphisms are shown in [Tables S1 and S2 (available as Supplementary data at JAC Online)](http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jac/dku088/-/DC1). The results did not differ in analyses that controlled for combined *CYP2B6* metabolizer strata.

## Discussion

A previous analysis involving 217 black, non-Hispanic individuals who initiated efavirenz-containing regimens in ACTG trials suggested an association between *CYP2B6* extensive metabolizer genotypes and virologic failure.^4^ We found no association between functional *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and virologic response among patients in Haiti who initiated an efavirenz-containing regimen and continued the regimen for ≥48 weeks. This is remarkable considering that median plasma efavirenz *C*_min_ values vary ∼10-fold across *CYP2B6* strata.^5^ Additional polymorphisms in *CYP2B6*, *CYP2A6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5* and *ABCB1* were not significantly associated with the likelihood of virologic response. We must consider polymorphisms with the lowest *P* values (*CYP3A4* rs2740574 and *CYP2A6* rs28399433) spurious unless replicated in other cohorts.

This study has several implications. With *CYP2B6* extensive metabolizer genotypes, virologic responses would likely not improve with increasing the efavirenz dose (i.e. to move into a higher *C*_min_ stratum). Conversely, these results suggest that with *CYP2B6* intermediate or slow extensive metabolizer genotypes, the efavirenz dose could be decreased from 600 mg once daily (perhaps to 400 mg in intermediate metabolizers and to 200 mg in slow metabolizers) without reducing virologic responses (i.e. to move into a lower *C*_min_ stratum). Such dose reduction might reduce CNS side effects. These results complement the ENCORE1 study, which showed no difference in virologic response among 630 subjects randomized to initiate once-daily efavirenz at 600 versus 400 mg, with once-daily tenofovir/emtricitabine, regardless of the *CYP2B6* genotype.^10^ Because 600 mg of efavirenz is often prescribed in fixed-dose combination tablets, efavirenz dose reduction may require an increased number of pills, which could reduce adherence.

This analysis had particular strengths. By considering *CYP2B6* C15582T, rather than only *CYP2B6* G516T and T983C, we could assign subjects to the very lowest efavirenz *C*_min_ stratum. Genotyping for *CYP2B6* C15582T reassigned 33% of subjects out of this lowest stratum, who were otherwise considered extensive metabolizers based solely on *CYP2B6* G516T and T983C. Possible confounding by non-adherence and other non-genetic factors was reduced by the use of modified direct observation in HT 001 and by focusing on individuals with no change in their antiretroviral therapy regimen before week 48 and with HIV-1 RNA data available at both week 0 and week 48.

There were limitations to this study. Associations between *CYP2B6* extensive metabolizer genotypes and virologic failure might be identified in individuals at increased likelihood of virologic failure if concomitant non-genetic factors (e.g. other medications) were to further lower plasma efavirenz exposure. While the present analysis was not designed to address possible side effects associated with higher plasma efavirenz concentrations, frequencies of *CYP2B6* slow metabolizer genotypes did not differ significantly between individuals included in this analysis and the other subjects with available genotype data.

This study enhances understanding of the influence of human genetic variants on antiretroviral pharmacodynamics and encourages continued efforts to use this knowledge to optimize antiretroviral safety and efficacy.
