## Abstract

**AIMS:** 
Thiotepa is widely used in high-dose chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown relations between exposure and severe organ toxicity. Thiotepa is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase enzymes. Polymorphisms of these enzymes may affect elimination of thiotepa and tepa, its main metabolite. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of known allelic variants in CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTA1 and GSTP1 genes on pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa.

**METHODS:** 
White patients (n = 124) received a high-dose regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin as intravenous infusions. Genomic DNA was analysed using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Plasma concentrations of thiotepa and tepa were determined using validated GC and LC-MS/MS methods. Relations between allelic variants and elimination pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (nonmem).

**RESULTS:** 
The polymorphisms CYP2B6 C1459T, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3, GSTA1 (C-69T, G-52A) and GSTP1 C341T had a significant effect on clearance of thiotepa or tepa. Although significant, most effects were generally not large. Clearance of thiotepa and tepa was predominantly affected by GSTP1 C341T polymorphism, which had a frequency of 9.3%. This polymorphism increased non-inducible thiotepa clearance by 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 41, 64, P < 0.001] and decreased tepa clearance by 32% (95% CI 29, 35, P < 0.001) in heterozygous patients, which resulted in an increase in combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa of 45% in homozygous patients.

**CONCLUSIONS:** 
This study indicates that the presently evaluated variant alleles explain only a small part of the substantial interindividual variability in thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics. Patients homozygous for the GSTP1 C341T allele may have enhanced exposure to thiotepa and tepa.

### AIMS

Thiotepa is widely used in high-dose chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown relations between exposure and severe organ toxicity. Thiotepa is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase enzymes. Polymorphisms of these enzymes may affect elimination of thiotepa and tepa, its main metabolite. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of known allelic variants in *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* genes on pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa.

### METHODS

White patients (*n* = 124) received a high-dose regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin as intravenous infusions. Genomic DNA was analysed using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Plasma concentrations of thiotepa and tepa were determined using validated GC and LC-MS/MS methods. Relations between allelic variants and elimination pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (nonmem).

### RESULTS

The polymorphisms *CYP2B6 C1459T*, *CYP3A4*1B*, *CYP3A5*3*, *GSTA1* (*C-69T, G-52A*) and *GSTP1 C341T* had a significant effect on clearance of thiotepa or tepa. Although significant, most effects were generally not large. Clearance of thiotepa and tepa was predominantly affected by *GSTP1 C341T* polymorphism, which had a frequency of 9.3%. This polymorphism increased non-inducible thiotepa clearance by 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 41, 64, *P* < 0.001] and decreased tepa clearance by 32% (95% CI 29, 35, *P* < 0.001) in heterozygous patients, which resulted in an increase in combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa of 45% in homozygous patients.

### CONCLUSIONS

This study indicates that the presently evaluated variant alleles explain only a small part of the substantial interindividual variability in thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics. Patients homozygous for the *GSTP1 C341T* allele may have enhanced exposure to thiotepa and tepa.

## Introduction

Interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics may lead to unpredictable toxicity and efficacy. This variability is particularly important in cancer therapy because of the narrow therapeutic window of anticancer agents. Factors contributing to this interpatient variability are environmental and physiological as well as genetic factors. Polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters and/or drug targets may explain some of the interindividual variation [[1](#b1)].

Thiotepa is an alkylating anticancer agent often co-administered with other anticancer agents in high-dose chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast, ovarian and testis tumours. With the use of peripheral blood progenitor cell support, bone-marrow toxicity is not dose limiting in these high-dose regimens. However, other toxicities can be severe and sometimes life-threatening, such as mucositis, veno-occlusive disease, oto- and cardiotoxicity [[2](#b2)].

Thiotepa is metabolized to its main metabolite tepa, which shows comparable alkylating activity [[3](#b3)]. Over a broad range of doses in adults, thiotepa has been reported to have an elimination half-life of 1.3–5.2 h, a clearance of 10–28 l h^−1^ m^−2^, and a volume of distribution of 27–65 l m^−2^[[4](#b4)]. Tepa is detectable in plasma within a few minutes after start of thiotepa infusion and persists longer with a half-life of 3–21 h. Interpatient variability in clearance of thiotepa has been reported to be between 28 and 90%. Variability in tepa exposure in high-dose thiotepa was 15–50% [[5](#b5)].

Relations between pharmacokinetics and toxicity have been described in several studies. It has been shown that increased systemic exposure to thiotepa and tepa (as a measure of total alkylating activity) leads to an increase in mucositis severity [[6](#b6)]. Przepiorka *et al.* described a relation between exposure to thiotepa and tepa and tepa peak levels with the occurrence of major nonhaematopoietic toxicity in a high-dose regimen [[4](#b4)]. Hence, identification of factors associated with the clearance of thiotepa and tepa could aid in individual dose selection.

Thiotepa is metabolized by oxidative desulphuration by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 to tepa [[7](#b7)]. Furthermore, thiotepa and tepa are conjugated to glutathione, which is catalysed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes A1-1 and P1-1 [[8](#b8)] ([Figure 1](#fig01)).

Metabolic biotransformation of thiotepa and tepa

It is known that polymorphisms in the *CYP2B6* gene cause functional alterations and decreased protein expression levels in human liver, although the role of the different *CYP2B6* alleles for the *in vivo* metabolism of drugs remains largely unknown [[9](#b9)]. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′-regulatory region of the *CYP3A4* gene (*CYP3A4*1B*) has been associated *in vitro* with enhanced CYP3A4 expression [[10](#b10), [11](#b11)], and the *CYP3A5*3* polymorphism leads to an inactive truncated protein [[12](#b12)]. GST has an important role in the inactivation of alkylating agents [[8](#b8)]. Allelic variants of *GST*s show different catalytic efficiency in conjugating glutathione to thiotepa [[13](#b13)].

In the present study, it was evaluated whether known variants of *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* genes are associated with the pharmacokinetic profile of thiotepa and its metabolite tepa in adult White cancer patients.

## Materials and methods

### Patient selection

One hundred and twenty-four patients were included in a number of clinical studies that employed the cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin (CTC) chemotherapy regimen with peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation [[14](#b14)–[16](#b16)]. Patients had either high-risk primary breast cancer and received high-dose chemotherapy as part of their adjuvant treatment, or had advanced breast, germ cell or ovarian cancer. All protocols were approved by the Committee of Medical Ethics of the Netherlands Cancer Institute, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

### Drug administration

Patients received either the full-dose CTC regimen (*n* = 67) or the ‘tiny’ CTC (tCTC) regimen (*n* = 57). The full-dose regimen consisted of 4 days’ chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (1500 mg m^−2^ day^−1^) as a 1-h infusion, immediately followed by carboplatin (AUC 5 mg min^−1^ ml^−1^) as a daily 1-h infusion and thiotepa (120 mg m^−2^ day^−1^) divided over two 30-min infusions (the second daily dose of thiotepa was administered 12 h after the first dose). The tCTC regimen was identical to the CTC regimen except that it incorporated two-thirds of the dose of each agent. Patients received either one or two courses of CTC or two or three courses of tCTC, when possible every 4 weeks. Details of the CTC and tCTC regimens have been published previously [[15](#b15), [16](#b16)].

Some of the patients (*n* = 62) were included in a protocol in which pharmacokinetically guided dosing was applied. Doses on days 3 and 4 of a course were adapted based on concentrations in samples collected at day 1 using defined targets. Doses in subsequent courses were calculated by also using data of previous courses [[14](#b14)]. Thiotepa doses based on pharmacokinetics ranged from 97 to 140 mg m^−2^ day^−1^.

### Sampling design

During the 4-day CTC course, blood samples were collected in polypropylene tubes containing lithium heparin as anticoagulant and immediately centrifuged (3500 *g* for 3 min at 4°C) to separate plasma. Complete pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed on two separate days, always including day 1 and days 3 or 4. Blood samples were obtained prior to the start of the infusions on all 4 days of chemotherapy and at the following time points: 30 (end of thiotepa infusion), 60, 90, 165, 270 and 540 min after the start of thiotepa infusion. On the first day after chemotherapy (day 5) an additional sample approximately 8 h after the last thiotepa infusion was collected. A total of 15 samples were available per patient per course.

### Bioanalysis

Thiotepa and tepa plasma concentrations were measured using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry [[17](#b17)] or a validated gas chromatographic assay with selective nitrogen/phosphorous detection [[18](#b18)]. Both methods have been extensively validated and cross-validated according to Food and Drug Administration guidelines [[19](#b19)]. Therefore, no discrimination between these methods during data analysis was employed. The lower limit of quantification using 100-µl plasma samples was 5 ng ml^−1^ for thiotepa and tepa. Accuracies and precisions were within ±12% and <11%, respectively.

### Pharmacogenetic analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using the method of Boom [[20](#b20)] and plasma using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The methods used for the amplification of the *CYP* genes have been described by Lang *et al.*[[21](#b21)] for *CYP2B6*, by Sata *et al.*[[22](#b22)] for *CYP3A4* and by van Schaik *et al.*[[23](#b23)] for *CYP3A5*. Genetic polymorphisms in *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* were analysed according to slightly modified methods previously described by Coles *et al.*[[24](#b24)], Jeronimo *et al.*[[25](#b25)] and Wang *et al.*[[26](#b26)]. Variations in *CYP2B6* (*C64T*, *A785G*, *C1459T*, *G516T*), *CYP3A4* (**1B* (*A-392G*), **3* (*T1334C*)), *CYP3A5* (**2* (*C27289A*), **3* (*A6986G*)), *GSTA1* (*C-69T*, *G-52A*) and *GSTP1* (*A313G*, *C341T*) were analysed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing.

In brief, PCR amplification reactions were performed in a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The results of the PCR reactions were analysed by gel electrophoresis. DNA cycle sequencing was carried out essentially as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on a PTC-200 thermocycler using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing mix v3.1. Both DNA strands were sequenced. Sequences were analysed on an Applied Biosystems 3100-Avant DNA sequencer. For sequence alignment Seqscape v2.1 (Applied Biosystems) was used. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated using the χ^2^ test.

### Population data analysis

Pharmacokinetic data of thiotepa and tepa were analysed with a previously developed and evaluated population pharmacokinetic model [[27](#b27)] using the nonlinear mixed effect modelling program NONMEM (version V, level 1.1) (Globomax LLC, Hanover, MD, USA). The analysis was performed using the first-order estimation method in NONMEM. The use of the first-order conditional estimation method (FOCE) was not feasible due to computational intensity.

In this model ([Figure 2](#fig02)), pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa were both described with a two-compartment model. Thiotepa was eliminated by a non-inducible route (CL_nonind_) and an inducible route (CL_ind_), the latter leading to formation of tepa. Tepa elimination was described by a first-order elimination clearance (CL_tepa_). Metabolism of thiotepa to its metabolite tepa was induced in the presence of cyclophosphamide. This process was modelled using an indirect effect model in which the indirect effect increased in the presence of cyclophosphamide. The apparent thiotepa clearance of the inducible route was directly proportional to this indirect effect. This indirect effect model was an ‘on–off’ model (in which the induction is switched ‘on’ after start of first administration of cyclophosphamide), since cyclophosphamide concentration did not influence the rate of enzyme formation or elimination. In this model interindividual variability for CL_nonind_, CL_ind_ and CL_tepa_ and interoccasion variability for CL_nonind_ and CL_ind_ were modelled using a proportional error model.

In the current study, the elimination model was extended to evaluate the influence of *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa. Genetic polymorphisms in the *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* genes were tested on their association with the elimination pharmacokinetic parameters CL_nonind_ and CL_tepa_, as were genetic polymorphisms in *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* on the elimination parameter CL_ind_. In the pharmacogenetic analysis, only SNPs with an allelic frequency of >4% were considered. In stage I of the pharmacogenetic analysis three separate models were evaluated, one model evaluating the effects of polymorphisms in *CYP2B6*, one model evaluating the effects of polymorphisms in *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* and one model evaluating the effects of polymorphisms in *GSTA1* and *GSTP1*. All polymorphisms per enzyme were included simultaneously on the elimination parameters of the basic pharmacokinetic model. Subsequently, for each model, the statistical significance of the included polymorphisms was tested in backward elimination procedures. For comparison of models with and without a polymorphism, the minimal value of objective function (OFV), which is proportional to negative twice the log likelihood, was used. A difference in OFV of 13.8 (d.f. = 2, corresponding to a *P*-value of 0.001, which includes a correction for multiple testing) was considered statistically significant.

In stage II the remaining significant polymorphisms of the three models of stage I were combined, and statistical significance was again tested in a second backward elimination procedure. Only effects of allelic variants that were significant in this analysis (*P* < 0.001) were retained in the final model. The 95% confidence intervals for the covariate effects were assessed by log-likelihood profiling.

Allelic variants were incorporated in the population model as covariate relations, according to the following equation:

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
Clearance had a typical value of CL_pop_ in wild-type patients. The typical value of heterozygous patients was equal to CL_pop_ reduced by θ_1_ × 100%. Homozygous mutations were assumed to have twice the impact of heterozygous mutations, and the typical value of homozygous patients was therefore equal to CL_pop_ reduced by 2 × θ_1_ × 100%. A separate effect was estimated if the genotype was unknown to avoid bias caused by missing data.

In order to investigate whether the relations between genotype and clearance remained significant in the presence of the demographic factors age, weight and sex, these relations were simultaneously included in the final model according to the following equations:

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
in which age is the individual age, and median is the median age of the population,

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
in which weight is the individual weight, and median is the median weight of the population, and

| Category |
| --- |
|   |
in which CL_pop_ is the population value for female patients (sex = 0) and θ is the fractional change in CL_pop_ for male patients (sex = 1).

Significance of the pharmacogenetic effects was tested in a backwards elimination procedure.

### Assessment of impact on exposure

Since patients were included in several protocols, including a protocol in which pharmacokinetically guided dosing was applied, the effect of the polymorphisms on exposure could not directly be estimated from the available data. Therefore, the effect on the AUC of thiotepa and tepa of allelic variants that remained in the final model was evaluated using a simulation study.

In this simulation study, a large cohort of patients with the same genetic variants as our own patient group was simulated to receive a standard CTC dose of thiotepa of 108 mg (60 mg m^−2^, body surface area 1.8 m^2^) twice daily for four consecutive days. For each patient, the AUC of thiotepa and tepa and the sum AUC were generated using the parameters of the final model. Wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous patient groups were simulated for each polymorphism, to estimate the effect of that polymorphism in the presence of the other polymorphisms. Each simulated group consisted of 12 400 patients (100 times the original dataset). Median AUCs and quartile values were calculated for wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous patients.

Furthermore, to determine which combinations of polymorphisms present in our population resulted in low or high exposure to thiotepa and tepa, 1000 new values of the AUC were simulated for each individual in the original dataset. Median values of these 1000 AUC values for each individual were ranged in an increasing order to detect specific combinations of polymorphisms that resulted in extremely low or high exposures to thiotepa and tepa.

Table 2 Caption: Genotype and allele frequencies for the studied variant genes

Observed allele frequencies of *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* in the current study were consistent with previously reported data in White populations [[23](#b23), [28](#b28)]. Frequencies of *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* were similar to those reported by Sweeney *et al.* and Dasgupta *et al.*[[29](#b29)–[31](#b31)]. All polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, except *CYP2B6 C64T* and *G516T*.

For *CYP3A4*3* and *CYP3A5*2* no homozygous variants and three heterozygotes were observed. These polymorphisms were not linked. Because of this low frequency, these SNPs were excluded from further analysis. The clearances of thiotepa or tepa in patients with a *CYP3A4*3* or *CYP3A5*2* variant were not different from the patients wild-type for these enzymes.

The *CYP2B6* (*C64T*, *A785G*, *C1459T*, *G516T*), *CYP3A4*1B*, *CYP3A5*3*, *GSTA1* (*C-69T*, *G-52A*), *GSTP1* (*A313G*, *C341T*) variants were included in the pharmacogenetic analysis to evaluate their effect on thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics. Since *CYP2B6 A785G* and *G516T* variants were closely linked (except for four patients who were heterozygous for the *A785G* variant and wild-type for the *G516T* variant, and one patient who was homozygous for the *G516T* variant and heterozygous for the *A785G* variant), these were simultaneously included as a single parameter in the analysis.

Upon inclusion of all significant effects from the stage I backwards elimination procedure, several relations between the allelic variants and elimination parameters of thiotepa and tepa remained statistically significant in stage II. Results are shown in [Table 3](#tbl3). These effects remained significant when corrected for known and possible factors involved in the pharmacokinetics of thiotepa, such as age, weight and sex. The covariates age, weight and sex had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of thiotepa, and the clinical relevance of these covariates is therefore of little importance [[32](#b32)].

Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for the final model are given in [Table 4](#tbl4) together with the interindividual, interoccasion and residual variability. All parameters were estimated with an acceptable precision (coefficient of variation 6.1–36.7%). Interoccasion variability could not be estimated for tepa elimination. Residual variability for thiotepa and tepa was rather small. Inclusion of pharmacogenetic effects resulted in a reduction of interindividual variability in non-inducible thiotepa clearance (46.2% *vs.* 55.0% in basic population model).

### Impact on exposure of pharmacogenetic effects

[Figure 3](#fig03) shows the influence of the various allelic variants on the exposure to thiotepa and tepa. Increases or decreases in exposure to thiotepa, tepa and the combination of thiotepa and tepa in heterozygous and homozygous patients are shown relative to the exposure in wild-type patients. The increase in thiotepa and tepa clearance caused by the *CYP2B6 C1459T* variant resulted in a reduction of the combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa of 20% in homozygous patients. Thiotepa exposure decreased 4%, whereas tepa exposure decreased by 26% in homozygous patients. The *CYP3A4*1B* variant reduced CL_ind_, which resulted in increased exposure to thiotepa of 26% and decreased exposure to tepa of 27% in homozygous patients. Combined exposure in homozygous patients was reduced by 12%. Since the effect of *CYP3A5*3* on thiotepa clearance was so small, we did not further evaluate the impact of this effect. CL_nonind_ was reduced in patients with the *GSTA1* (*C-69T*, *G-52A*) variant. This resulted in increased exposure to the alkylating agents in homozygous patients of 17%. The *GSTP1 C341T* variant caused an increase in CL_nonind_ of 52% and a decrease in CL_tepa_ of 32%. The simulation study showed that this resulted in a decrease in thiotepa exposure of 34% and an increase in tepa exposure of 79% in homozygous individuals. The combined exposure of thiotepa and tepa in homozygous individuals increased by 45%.

WT_TT, exposure to thiotepa in wild-type patients; Het_TT, exposure to thiotepa in heterozygous patients; Hom_TT, exposure to thiotepa in homozygous patients; WT_T, exposure to tepa in wild-type patients; Het_T, exposure to tepa in heterozygous patients; Hom_T, exposure to tepa in homozygous patients; WT_com, combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa in wild-type patients; Het_com, combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa in heterozygous patients; Hom_com, combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa in homozygous patients. AUC values of wild-type patients were set at 100% (dashed line)

The simulation study of the combination of polymorphisms confirmed this finding. The 124 individuals could be divided into 26 groups with the same combination of polymorphisms (based on the genotypes that were included in the final model). In this simulation, the combination of polymorphisms that contained the homozygote variant *GSTP1 C341T*[along with homozygote variant *CYP3A5*3* and *GSTA* (*C-69T*, *G-52A*) and wild-type *CYP3A4*1B* and *CYP2B6 C1459T*] showed the highest exposure to thiotepa and tepa (median combined exposure 687 h µM^−1^), whereas the median exposure to thiotepa and tepa for the other combination of polymorphisms ranged from 336 to 519 h µM^−1^. No other combination of polymorphisms resulted in extremely low or high exposures to thiotepa and tepa.

## Discussion

In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the disposition of thiotepa and tepa is dependent on genetic variability in the *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* genes. We have demonstrated that non-inducible thiotepa clearance was significantly increased by *CYP3A5*3* and *GSTP1 C341T* polymorphisms and decreased by the *GSTA1* (*C-69T*, *G-52A*) polymorphism. The inducible clearance of thiotepa was significantly increased by the *CYP2B6 C1459T* variant, and decreased by *CYP3A4*1B*. *CYP2B6 C1459T* significantly increased clearance of tepa and *GSTP1 C341T* decreased clearance of tepa.

The *CYP2B6* gene has been mapped to chromosome 19 between 19q12 and 19q13.2, and is composed of nine exons [[33](#b33)]. Lang *et al.*[[21](#b21)] identified nine point mutations of the *CYP2B6* gene in a White population. Five of these polymorphisms cause amino acid substitutions in exons 1, 4, 5 and 9. Polymorphisms in the *CYP2B6* gene have been shown to result in altered protein expression and activity [[33](#b33)].

*In vitro* studies have shown that protein levels of variant *CYP2B6* were less than that of wild-type *CYP2B6*[[21](#b21), [33](#b33)]. The activity of the *CYP2B6* variants *A785G* and *G516T* was significantly higher than that of wild-type *CYP2B6*[[33](#b33), [34](#b34)]. In contrast, the activity of the *C64T* variant was not different from that of wild type [[33](#b33)], and the activity of the *C1459T* variant was reduced [[21](#b21)]. In the current pharmacogenetic study, the *CYP2B6 C1459T* variant increased the clearance of thiotepa and tepa. This resulted in a reduction of combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa of 20% in homozygous patients. Whereas Lang *et al.*[[21](#b21)] showed a reduced enzyme activity in carriers of the *C1459T* mutation, in this study the *C1459T* variant increased clearance of thiotepa and tepa. This might be due to the different substrates used; furthermore, we determined the effects in patients, whereas Lang *et al.* used human liver samples.

The *CYP3A* locus comprises four genes that code for the functional enzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7 and CYP3A43, of which CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the most important [[35](#b35)]. Because of polymorphisms in the genes encoding these proteins [[36](#b36)], it has been proposed that genotyping for *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* variants may be useful for prediction of total CYP3A activity. Many SNPs have been identified in the *CYP3A4* gene, but most are unlikely to affect CYP3A4 activity *in vivo*[[36](#b36), [37](#b37)]. In the present study, *CYP3A4*1B* decreased the inducible thiotepa clearance. Other authors have shown that *CYP3A4*1B* caused a modest decrease in systemic midazolam [[38](#b38)] and ciclosporin clearance [[39](#b39), [40](#b40)], whereas others did not find an effect [[41](#b41), [42](#b42)].

In contrast to CYP3A4, the CYP3A5 protein isoform is known to be expressed in only a small percentage of White individuals, and this has been linked to a common transition in intron 3 of the *CYP3A5* gene (*CYP3A5*3*), which results in a splicing defect [[12](#b12), [43](#b43)]. Approximately 85–95% of White subjects are homozygous variant for *CYP3A5*3* and thus are deficient of functionally active CYP3A5 [[44](#b44)], which is consistent with the currently observed genotype frequency of 92.8%. In this study, *CYP3A5*3* resulted in a minor increase of non-inducible thiotepa clearance. Although *CYP3A5*3* results in a deficiency in active CYP3A5, the observed increase in clearance could be due to linkage of *CYP3A5*3* to other, not determined polymorphisms that result in increased activity. This is similar to findings obtained in healthy subjects and cancer patients using CYP3A phenotyping probes [[45](#b45), [46](#b46)] or paclitaxel [[47](#b47)], in which no major influence of the *CYP3A5* polymorphism could be demonstrated.

Conjugation of glutathione by GST has been postulated as a mechanism by which alkylating cytostatic drugs can be inactivated intracellularly. It has been shown that both GSTA1 and GSTP1 catalyse the formation of the monoglutathionyl conjugate of thiotepa and tepa [[8](#b8)].

In the present study, the *GSTA1* (*C-69T*, *G-52A*) variant resulted in a lower thiotepa clearance compared with wild-type *GSTA1*. Coles *et al.*[[24](#b24)] have shown that GST expression of the *GSTA1* variant was reduced in 55 normal human liver samples. Kusama *et al.*[[48](#b48)] also showed that busulfan clearance was reduced in patients with the heterozygous variant of *GSTA1*. On the other hand, Bredschneider *et al.*[[49](#b49)] have investigated GSTA1 expression and GST activity in 48 normal human liver samples and reported no relation with the *GSTA1* SNPs.

In the *GSTP1* gene, two functional polymorphisms (*A313G* and *C341T*) have been identified, which resulted in decreased enzyme activity [[50](#b50)]. Srivastava *et al.*[[13](#b13)] showed that the catalytic efficiency of glutathione conjugation to thiotepa was lower in the *A313G* and *C341T* variants compared with wild type. We have shown that the *GSTP1 C341T* variant resulted in an increase in non-inducible thiotepa clearance and a decrease in tepa clearance. This caused an increase in combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa of 45% in homozygous individuals. It should be noted, however, that there were only one homozygous and 19 heterozygous *GSTP1 C341T* individuals. The homozygous individual in our dataset did not have extremely high exposure to thiotepa and tepa and did not experience severe toxicity. Other unidentified polymorphisms could have compensated for the increased exposure caused by *GSTP1 C341T* in this individual. Furthermore, all patients received a chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin. Therefore, it is difficult to attribute the occurrence or absence of toxicity to thiotepa alone.

In this study, it was assumed that homozygous mutations had twice the impact of heterozygous mutations. This does not take into account possible upregulation of the functional allele in heterozygous patients. However, frequencies of homozygous mutations were too low to estimate both effects precisely.

Although various significant relations between polymorphisms and clearance of thiotepa and tepa have been established, their effect on combined exposure was generally <20% and the effects were small compared with interindividual variability. In a previous study, we have shown that mean exposure to thiotepa and tepa in patients with grade 2/3 hepatic toxicity was 39% higher than in patients with grade ≤1 toxicity (395 *vs.* 284 µM h^−1^) [[6](#b6)]. Thus, the increase in combined exposure caused by the *GSTA1* (*C-69T*, *G-52A*) variant alone (17% in homozygous individuals) will probably not have a large impact on treatment-related toxicity. However, increased combined exposure of thiotepa and tepa of 45% in homozygous individuals, caused by *GSTP1 C341T* variant, could be of clinical relevance. Since the frequency of the *GSTP1 C341T* variant in this White population is 9.3%, which is comparable to other White populations, not many patients will be affected by this variant.

In conclusion, the effect of *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *GSTA1* and *GSTP1* polymorphisms on thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics was investigated for the first time. This study has indicated that the presently evaluated variant alleles explain only a small part of the substantial interindividual variability in thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics. Patients homozygous for the *GSTP1 C341T* allele may have enhanced exposure to thiotepa and tepa. Further work is needed to clearly establish the impact of homozygosity for the *GSTP1 C341T* variant allele on thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics and any clinical consequences.
