## Abstract

Rationale: In a prior study, lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment (≤28 d) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) heterozygous for F508del-CFTR did not improve lung function.

Objectives: To evaluate an optimized lumacaftor/ivacaftor dosing regimen with a longer duration in a cohort of patients heterozygous for F508del-CFTR.

Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older with a confirmed CF diagnosis and percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) of 40 to 90 were randomized to lumacaftor/ivacaftor (400 mg/250 mg every 12 h) or placebo daily for 56 days. Primary outcomes were change in ppFEV1 at Day 56 and safety. Other disease markers were evaluated.

Measurements and Main Results: Of 126 patients, 119 (94.4%) completed the study. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was well tolerated, although chest tightness and dyspnea occurred more frequently with active treatment than with placebo (27.4% vs. 14.3% and 14.5% vs. 6.3%, respectively). Mean (SD) ppFEV1 values at baseline were 62.9 (14.3) in the active treatment group and 60.1 (14.0) in the placebo group. Absolute changes in ppFEV1 (least squares mean [SE]) at Day 56 were −0.6 (0.8) percentage points in the active treatment group and −1.2 (0.8) percentage points in the placebo group (P = 0.60). CF respiratory symptom scores in the active treatment group improved by a mean of 5.7 points versus a decrease of −0.8 in the placebo group (P < 0.01). No changes in body mass index occurred. Changes from baseline in sweat chloride (least squares mean [SE]) at Day 56 were −11.8 (1.3) mmol/L in the active treatment group and −0.8 (1.2) mmol/L in the placebo group (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions: Sweat chloride and respiratory symptom scores improved with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, though no meaningful benefit was seen in ppFEV1 or body mass index in patients heterozygous for F508del-CFTR.

## Methods

### Study Design and Participants

Detailed methods describing this phase II multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled VX09-809-102 study ([www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) identifier [NCT01225211](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01225211)), as well as results from the first three cohorts, have been published previously ([11](#bib11)). In cohort 4, patients were randomized at 51 sites in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The study protocol, informed consent, and other necessary documents were approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board for each study site before initiation. This study was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice as described in the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline E6, Good Clinical Practice, Consolidated Guidance (April 1996).

A total of 126 patients aged 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of CF and ppFEV_1_ between 40 and 90 (inclusive) of normal for age, sex, and height were eligible for inclusion in cohort 4 ([14](#bib14), [15](#bib15)). All patients were tested for *CFTR* genotype at screening; eligible patients had the *F508del-CFTR* mutation on one allele plus a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in the lack of CFTR production or otherwise expected to be unresponsive to ivacaftor (based on *in vitro* testing). Second *CFTR* allele mutations for these patients are given in Table E1 in the online supplement. All enrolled patients provided written informed consent.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 hours in combination with ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours or matched placebo for 56 days ([Figure 1](#fig1)). Randomization was stratified by sex (male vs. female) and ppFEV_1_ severity at screening (<70 vs. ≥70).

Study design. *The first dose of study drug was administered on Day 1. †On Day 56, the last dose of study drug was administered in the morning. ‡Patients who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment 7 or more days before the Day 56 visit were not required to complete a safety follow-up visit. q12h = every 12 hours.

### Procedures

Lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 hours/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours or placebo were administered orally on Day 1 through Day 56. Spirometric assessments and sweat chloride collection were completed, and the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised (CFQ-R) ([16](#bib16)) was administered prior to the morning dose of study drug at applicable study visits.

### Outcomes

The primary outcome measures were safety, tolerability, and the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV_1_ at Day 56. Key secondary outcome measures included relative change from baseline in ppFEV_1_ and absolute change in BMI, patient-reported respiratory symptoms in the CFQ-R respiratory domain (a change of 4 points in the respiratory domain score being considered the minimal clinically important difference) ([16](#bib16)), body weight, and sweat chloride concentrations at Day 56. Safety evaluations included laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and standard adverse event reporting.

### Statistical Analyses

Efficacy analyses were conducted for all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. The primary efficacy outcome measure was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis, with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV_1_ as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and patient as a random effect. The model was adjusted for sex and for ppFEV_1_ at screening (<70 vs. ≥ 70).

The primary result obtained from the model was treatment effect at Day 56. Key secondary outcomes were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis similar to that used for the primary outcome measure. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control the overall type I error rate at 0.05 for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints in the following order: absolute change in ppFEV_1_, relative change in ppFEV_1_, absolute change in BMI, absolute change in the CFQ-R respiratory domain, and absolute change in body weight, all from baseline at Day 56. At each step, the test for treatment effect was considered statistically significant if the *P* value was less than or equal to 0.05 and all previous tests also met this level of significance.

## Results

Patient disposition is shown in [Figure 2](#fig2). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar across treatment groups and consistent with those seen in patients with CF and moderate lung disease ([Table 1](#tbl1)) ([17](#bib17)). The mean (SD) age of all participants was 29.9 (8.4) years. The mean (SD) baseline ppFEV_1_ values were 62.9 (14.3) in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group and 60.1% (14.0) in the placebo group; these values are similar to those in other large studies of this treatment combination ([11](#bib11), [12](#bib12)). The mean (SD) sweat chloride values at the time of randomization were 100.7 (12.5) mmol/L in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group and 102.9 (9.2) mmol/L in the placebo group, reflecting minimal CFTR function at baseline.

The most common adverse events ([Table 2](#tbl2)) were respiration abnormal (i.e., chest tightness), infective PEx of CF, cough, increased sputum, and dyspnea. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and the placebo group, although more patients in the treatment group than in the placebo group experienced abnormal respiration and dyspnea (17 [27.4%] and 9 [14.5%] patients in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group vs. 9 [14.3%] and 4 [6.3%] patients in the placebo group, respectively). Drug treatment was well tolerated; only four (6.5%) patients in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group had adverse events leading to discontinuation in the study ([Figure 2](#fig2)). Two patients discontinued because of infective PEx of CF; one discontinued because of increased aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase; and one discontinued because of abnormal respiration, nausea, and dizziness. None of the patients in the placebo group discontinued the study because of adverse events. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Serious adverse events were reported in nine (14.5%) patients in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group and five (7.9%) in the placebo group.

The key efficacy data are shown in [Table 3](#tbl3). Patients were assessed at baseline and Day 56. The absolute changes in ppFEV_1_ (least squares [LS] mean [SE]) at 56 days were −0.6 (0.8) percentage points for patients in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group and −1.2 (0.8) percentage points for patients in the placebo group (*P* = 0.60) ([Figure 3A](#fig3)). The LS mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) difference (active − placebo) was 0.6 (−1.7, 2.9). The number of patients who had at least a 5% improvement in ppFEV_1_ at the end of the study was no greater in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI = 0.7, 4.3; nominal *P* = 0.25). Note that, within the framework of the hierarchical testing procedures, statistically significant differences between treatment groups were not observed for the primary endpoint; therefore, none of the key secondary endpoints could be considered statistically significant, regardless of the nominal *P* value. The patient-reported CFQ-R respiratory domain scores (LS mean [SE]) were 5.7 (1.9) points in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group and −0.8 (1.8) points for the placebo group; the treatment difference was 6.5 points, which was nominally statistically significant (*P* = 0.01) ([Figure 3B](#fig3) and [Table 3](#tbl3)).

Absolute change from baseline in (A) ppFEV1 by visit, (B) CFQ-R respiratory domain score by visit, (C) sweat chloride concentration by visit, and (D) body mass index by visit. *P = 0.01 versus placebo; †P < 0.0001 versus placebo. BMI = body mass index; CFQ-R = Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised; LS = least squares; ppFEV1 = percent predicted FEV1; q12h = every 12 hours; lumacaftor/ivacaftor (n = 62), placebo (n = 63).

CFTR activity was estimated by serial assessments of sweat chloride ([Figure 3C](#fig3) and [Table 3](#tbl3)). A reduction in sweat chloride was observed in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group (LS mean [SE]) at Day 14 (−9.4 [1.1] mmol/L; nominal *P* < 0.0001), which became further pronounced at Day 56 (−11.8 [1.3] mmol/L; nominal *P* < 0.0001). Patients in the placebo group had no significant change in sweat chloride at any time point (−1.8 [1.0] and −0.8 [1.2] mmol/L at Day 14 and Day 56, respectively). Nutritional status was estimated by the change in BMI. There were no statistically significant improvements in BMI ([Figure 3D](#fig3) and [Table 3](#tbl3)) or body weight ([Table 3](#tbl3)) during the study, and outcomes favored the placebo group.

## Discussion

The purpose of this cohort of study VX09-809-102 was to determine whether prolonged treatment with combination lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy at a dose higher than previously tested could result in clinically meaningful efficacy improvements in patients heterozygous for the *F508del-CFTR* mutation, with a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in the lack of CFTR production or otherwise expected to be unresponsive to ivacaftor. Results for cohorts 1–3 had suggested the potential for efficacy, based on a gene–dose effect with lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy for an abbreviated (28-d) treatment period ([11](#bib11)). Results from this cohort (cohort 4) suggest that the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 hours/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours over a 56-day treatment period does not significantly improve ppFEV_1_, the primary outcome measure, in patients heterozygous for *F508del-CFTR*.

Despite observing negative results for this primary outcome measure, results of secondary outcomes from this study suggest that corrector-potentiator treatment has a pharmacologic effect in patients with a single *F508del* allele. Nominally significant improvements (*P* < 0.0001) were observed in sweat chloride concentrations, a biomarker for CFTR activity in patients with CF. The magnitude of the difference in sweat chloride between treatment groups at 56 days (11.0 mmol/L [95% CI = −14.5, −7.6]) was similar to that seen with the same dosing regimen when administered to patients homozygous for *F508del-CFTR* (11.1 mmol/L [95% CI = −18.5, −3.7]), although the point estimate for the latter was based on a small sample size (n = 9) ([11](#bib11)).

Ongoing studies evaluating the effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on sweat chloride, or alternatively other F508del-CFTR corrector-potentiator combination treatments, may provide additional context for these data because this degree of CFTR function improvement would be expected to result in at least a modest clinical benefit over the duration studied in this trial. Indeed, the data provide a lower limit of aggregate sweat chloride change, indicating that changes of less than 10 mmol/L are unlikely to have measurable clinical benefit in modulator studies of up to 2 months in duration. Such information is valuable for the advancement of sweat chloride as a potential surrogate outcome measure when developing future clinical trials.

In addition to changes in sweat chloride, lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment was also associated with improvements in CF symptoms. The absolute change from baseline at Day 56 in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score with lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment was 5.7 points, compared with −0.8 points with placebo (treatment difference, 6.5 [95% CI = 1.4, 11.6]). The lumacaftor/ivacaftor response exceeded the minimally clinically important difference (4 points) and was higher than the score observed with the same dosing regimen in patients homozygous for *F508del-CFTR* (CFQ-R score, 4.0 [95% CI = −6.8, 14.8]) ([11](#bib11)). These findings are somewhat surprising, given the magnitude of changes in other clinical indicators, and might indicate that patients are perceiving a treatment effect that is not measured by lung function.

It should be noted that no benefits were seen in BMI with lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in this study. There was a small improvement in BMI in patients receiving placebo at Day 56, although the change was not statistically significant compared with the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group.

Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was well tolerated in this population, and the safety profile was consistent with that observed in the phase III studies of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients homozygous for *F508del-CFTR* ([12](#bib12)). Few treatment discontinuations occurred, and no differences in the overall rate of adverse events were seen in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group as compared with the placebo group. However, chest tightness and dyspnea were observed more frequently in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group than in the placebo group; similar findings have been reported for patients homozygous for *F508del-CFTR* ([11](#bib11), [12](#bib12)). These respiratory symptoms tended to occur upon treatment initiation in patients in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment group, whereas patients receiving placebo generally experienced symptoms after the first week of the study. In those patients continuing lumacaftor/ivacaftor, the effect resolved with continued dosing by the fourth week for the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and by the sixth week for the placebo group.

It is possible that subclinical bronchoconstriction partly accounts for the inconsistency in CFTR activity as reflected in sweat chloride, clinical symptoms, and change in lung function at Day 56. The evaluation of other correctors that are similarly efficacious but not associated with chest tightness may help provide context for these data. These findings further suggest that developers of CFTR-targeted strategies may need to consider outcomes beyond ppFEV_1_ to guide development, such as patient-reported outcomes and acute PEx frequency.

### Conclusions

This study demonstrates that lumacaftor/ivacaftor is generally well tolerated in patients heterozygous for *F508del-CFTR* but does not exhibit sufficient efficacy to warrant further evaluation when the primary outcome measure is ppFEV_1_. Nevertheless, significant changes in sweat chloride concentrations in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group versus placebo, coupled with an improvement in patient-reported respiratory symptoms, indicate some restitution of CFTR function.
