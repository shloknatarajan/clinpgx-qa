## Abstract

**Aim:** 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 genotype in paediatric liver transplant recipients and donors, and the contribution of age and gender to tacrolimus disposition on the first day after transplantation.

**Methods:** 
The contribution of the CYP3A4/5 genotype in paediatric liver transplant recipients and donors to the tacrolimus blood trough concentrations (C0) and the tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio on day 1 was evaluated in 67 liver‐transplanted children: 33 boys and 34 girls, mean age 4.5 years.

**Results:** 
Donor CYP3A5 genotype appears to be significantly associated with tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation (P < 0.0002). Other physiological factors, such as recipient age and donor gender may also play a role and lead to significant differences in tacrolimus C0 and tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio on day 1. However, according to the general linear model, only recipient age appears to be independently associated with tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation (P < 0.03). Indeed, there was a faster tacrolimus metabolism in children under 6 years of age (P < 0.02).

**Conclusions:** 
Donor CYP3A5 genotype, recipient age and, to a lesser extent, donor gender appear to be associated with tacrolimus disposition on day 1 after transplant. This suggests that increasing the starting tacrolimus doses in paediatric patients under 6 years of age who receive a graft from a male extensive metabolizer may enhance the possibility of their tacrolimus levels reaching the therapeutic range sooner.

### Aim

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the cytochrome P450 (*CYP) 3A4/5* genotype in paediatric liver transplant recipients and donors, and the contribution of age and gender to tacrolimus disposition on the first day after transplantation.

### Methods

The contribution of the *CYP3A4/5* genotype in paediatric liver transplant recipients and donors to the tacrolimus blood trough concentrations (C_0_) and the tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio on day 1 was evaluated in 67 liver‐transplanted children: 33 boys and 34 girls, mean age 4.5 years.

### Results

Donor *CYP3A5* genotype appears to be significantly associated with tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation (*P* < 0.0002). Other physiological factors, such as recipient age and donor gender may also play a role and lead to significant differences in tacrolimus C_0_ and tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio on day 1. However, according to the general linear model, only recipient age appears to be independently associated with tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation (*P* < 0.03). Indeed, there was a faster tacrolimus metabolism in children under 6 years of age (*P* < 0.02).

### Conclusions

Donor *CYP3A5* genotype, recipient age and, to a lesser extent, donor gender appear to be associated with tacrolimus disposition on day 1 after transplant. This suggests that increasing the starting tacrolimus doses in paediatric patients under 6 years of age who receive a graft from a male extensive metabolizer may enhance the possibility of their tacrolimus levels reaching the therapeutic range sooner.

## Introduction

Tacrolimus is a calcineurin‐inhibiting immunosuppressant drug widely used in solid organ transplantation [3](#bcp13219-bib-0003) which is effective in the management both of adult and paediatric transplant patients [4](#bcp13219-bib-0004). However, this drug has a narrow therapeutic index, exposing patients to a risk of acute graft rejection or toxicity if its blood concentrations are, respectively, too low or too high. Moreover, tacrolimus concentrations and pharmacokinetics vary considerably on the first day after transplantation, thus complicating dose calculations. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was introduced in order to reduce variability and avoid over‐ or under‐dosing. TDM may be carried out by measuring the tacrolimus trough concentration in peripheral blood 12 h after a dose (C_0_) or by the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC), with the primary goal of maintaining C_0_ and AUC within a predefined therapeutic range [5](#bcp13219-bib-0005). Thus, TDM is crucial for optimizing treatment efficacy, reducing rejection episodes and preventing adverse effects in daily practice. However, despite the undoubted contribution by TDM in improving long‐term patient and graft survival, it has been demonstrated that reaching the immunosuppressant target concentrations quickly is crucial [6](#bcp13219-bib-0006). Recent literature has reported that patients should reach target blood concentrations as early as possible in the first week after transplantation, to minimize early rejection risk [7](#bcp13219-bib-0007). This is especially important in paediatric recipients, where certain factors, such as growth, age‐related changes, as well as time from transplantation, co‐medications, and hepatic and renal function, may influence the response to immunosuppressants. Therefore, choosing the correct first oral dose of tacrolimus, when it is not yet TDM guided, may well reduce the time needed to reach the drug therapeutic window and prove beneficial, particularly in paediatric liver transplant patients.

To meet this goal, numerous authors have suggested that some genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in the genes coding for biotransformation enzymes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 3A4 and 3A5], should be taken into account to guide the initial tacrolimus dosing [8](#bcp13219-bib-0008). Indeed, it has been consistently demonstrated that CYP3A5 expressers (*CYP3A5*1/*1* and **1/*3* carriers) have lower C_0_ levels and higher oral clearance [clearance (CL)/bioavailability (F)], thus requiring higher tacrolimus doses to reach the same C_0_ at steady state than CYP3A5 non‐expressers (*CYP3A5*3/*3* carriers). These findings support the case for a strategy of pharmacogenetic‐based dosing of tacrolimus [9](#bcp13219-bib-0009). A new single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 6 (15289C > T; *CYP3A4*22*) has recently been described, which demonstrates decreased CYP3A4 mRNA hepatic expression and a lower microsomal CYP3A4 enzymatic activity in the T‐variant allele [10](#bcp13219-bib-0010). Although the effect of this newly described *CYP3A4* polymorphism on tacrolimus dosing requirements and C_0_ has been extensively investigated in adults, data in children are scanty [11](#bcp13219-bib-0011), [12](#bcp13219-bib-0012).

A retrospective study was carried out to evaluate whether the *CYP3A4/5* combined genotype approach in paediatric liver recipients and donors could achieve target blood tacrolimus concentrations more quickly. The contribution of other factors, such as age and gender, on tacrolimus disposition on the first day after transplantation was also investigated.

## Patients and methods

A total of 67 paediatric patients (aged <18 years at transplant), managed on oral tacrolimus after a liver transplant performed at A.O.U. Città della Salute e della Scienza, Torino, Italy, were enrolled into the study. DNA samples from the recipients and their donors were provided by the Regional Transplantation Centre (CRT Piemonte e Valle d'Aosta, Italy) (Table [1](#bcp13219-tbl-0001)).

Approval of the local ethics committee (protocol identification number 15386/28.3) was obtained, as was a written informed consent from the patients' parents or guardians. A population study for the *CYP3A4*22* SNP was also performed on peripheral blood samples collected from 262 unrelated healthy adult volunteers of Italian‐Caucasian descent, recruited from blood donors at the Centre's blood bank, A.O.U. Città della Salute e della Scienza, Torino, Italy. This study was also approved by the local ethics committee (protocol identification number 8802/A5.4) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Induction therapy with an interleukin‐2 receptor antagonist (basiliximab) was administered to 52/67 patients and the first tacrolimus dose was given perioperatively in all of them (Table [1](#bcp13219-tbl-0001)). Tacrolimus was then administered orally or via naso‐gastric tube on the first day in all transplanted patients, to reach a total daily dose of 0.15 mg kg^–1^ day^–1^ as per protocol. TDM was used to adjust the subsequent tacrolimus doses, aiming at reaching a target C_0_ of 10–12 ng ml^–1^. Steroids were added in 41/67 patients (Table [1](#bcp13219-tbl-0001)).

### Tacrolimus concentration measurement

Tacrolimus C_0_ values were quantified according to the Waters MassTrak Immunosuppressants XE Kit protocol, taking into account the Lake Louise Consensus document for therapeutic drug monitoring. Instrumental analysis was performed using Waters Acquity™ Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a Waters Acquity Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry Detector (TQD) Waters, Milford, MA, USA [13](#bcp13219-bib-0013).

Criteria adopted to satisfy the guidelines on tacrolimus therapeutic drug monitoring in whole‐blood samples take into account the measured quality control values within 10% of the values stated in the certificate of analysis, performed at least once per day at the initial run batch.

The accuracy of tacrolimus quantification was checked by participating in an external proficiency‐testing scheme, set up by Bionalytics, UK.

The tacrolimus C_0_ for the effect of dose adjustments was normalized to obtain the tacrolimus C_0_/weight‐adjusted dose ratio, as the tacrolimus C_0_, in itself, does not well define the variability in doses and blood levels of tacrolimus between different transplant patients [8](#bcp13219-bib-0008), [14](#bcp13219-bib-0014), [15](#bcp13219-bib-0015).

### Genotyping

Donor and recipient DNA samples were genotyped for *CYP3A4*22* and *CYP3A5*3* using the allelic discrimination reaction performed using TaqMan (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The *CYP3A4*22* assay was validated by sequencing homozygous wild‐type (**1/*1*), heterozygous (**1/*22*) and homozygous mutant (**22/*22*) samples. When whole‐body metabolism was considered, the patients were classified as rapid metabolizers (RM) if the donor/recipient pair carried all, or at least five, *CYP3A4/5*1* alleles; as extensive CYP3A4/5 metabolizers (EM), if they carried four *CYP3A4/5*1* alleles; and as intermediate CYP3A4/5 metabolizers (IM), if they carried none, or up to three *CYP3A4/5*1* alleles in their recipient and donor DNA (Table [2](#bcp13219-tbl-0002)).

### Table 2.

| CYP3A5 donor | *1/*3 | *3/*3 | *3/*3 | *1/*1 |

Table 2 Caption: CYP3A4/5 recipient and donor genotype profiles

When only recipient or donor metabolism was considered, the patients were classified as RM if they carried all or three *CYP3A4/5*1* alleles; as EM if they carried two *CYP3A4/5*1* alleles; and as IM if they carried none, or one *CYP3A4/5*1* allele.

### Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) or as median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences were compared using either the Kruskal–Wallis or the Mann–Whitney tests, as appropriate, and a *P* value of less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. A general linear model was performed to test the overall contribution of *CYP3A5* genotype, donor gender and recipient age to tacrolimus levels. All data analyses were carried out using SPSS 23.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

We tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium using the method described by Rodriguez *et al*. [16](#bcp13219-bib-0016).

## Results

### Patient characteristics

Table [1](#bcp13219-tbl-0001) reports on the 67 paediatric liver transplant patients who were eligible for the study, with the demographic details of recipients and donors.

### Tacrolimus disposition

Data for tacrolimus concentration (ng/ml) and concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio (ng/ml/dose) on the first day after liver transplantation were available for all patients. The median tacrolimus C_0_ was 7.8 (IQR 9.1 ng ml^–1^) and the median concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio was 95 (IQR 111 ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^) (Figures [1](#bcp13219-fig-0001)A and B). A total of 67.2% of all analysed concentrations fell below the target range of 10–12 ng ml^–1^, while 25.4% were higher than the upper desired limit (Figure [1](#bcp13219-fig-0001)A).

(B) Tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio on the first day after liver transplantation in the whole paediatric population. The horizontal line in the middle indicates the median; the top and the bottom lines mark the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively

### Influence of other drugs, graft–recipient weight ratio, gender and age on tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation

We observed no influence of glucocorticoids, antifungal drugs or the graft–recipient weight ratio (GRWR) on tacrolimus C_0_ or on the concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios in our paediatric population on the first post‐transplant day, whereas the donor gender and age of the recipient did seem to play a major role in tacrolimus disposition. On the first day after transplant, recipients of a male donor graft had a median C_0_ of 5.6 (IQR 7 ng ml^–1^), while recipients of a female organ had a median C_0_ of 9.7 (IQR 10 ng ml^–1^; *P* < 0.02) and median concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios of 87 (IQR 125) *vs.* 147 (IQR 113 ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^) (*P* < 0.04).

Age‐related differences in our patients, stratified for an age at transplant under or above 6 years, were observed only in the recipients, and exclusively for the tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios [86 (IQR 123 ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^) under 6 years of age *vs.* 139 (IQR 100 ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^) above 6 years of age] (*P* < 0.02) (Figure [2](#bcp13219-fig-0002)). The discrepancy observed in the statistical significance when comparing the groups only according to tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio might well reflect the fact that the dosenormalization better defines the wide intervariability in the tacrolimus C_0_ among paediatric transplant patients compared with tacrolimus C_0_ without dose normalization.

A P value of less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant

### Frequency of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 variants in paediatric liver transplant recipients and donors

DNA samples for *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* genotyping were available for all 67 patients and their donors.

Taking into consideration the recipients' *CYP3A4* genotype, 59 (88%) carried the *CYP3A4*1/*1* genotype, six (9%) carried the *CYP3A4*1/*22* genotype and two (3%) carried the *CYP3A4*22/*22* genotype.

The *CYP3A4* genotyping of donors showed that 55 (82%) carried the *CYP3A4*1/*1* genotype, 11 (16%) carried the *CYP3A4*1/*22* genotype and one (1.5%) carried the *CYP3A4*22/*22* genotype.

Taking into consideration the recipients' *CYP3A5* genotype, one (1.5%) carried the *CYP3A5*1/*1* genotype, eight (12%) carried the *CYP3A4*1/*3* genotype and 58 (87%) carried the *CYP3A5*3/*3* genotype. The *CYP3A5* donor genotyping showed that one (1.5%) carried the *CYP3A5*1/*1* genotype, 28 (33%) carried the *CYP3A5*1/*3* genotype and 44 (66%) carried the *CYP3A5*3/*3* genotype. According to the frequency of *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* variants in our paediatric liver transplant patients, a higher frequency of the *CYP3A5*1* allele was observed in donors, suggesting that some liver donors might come from ethnic groups in which the *CYP3A5*1* allele frequency is higher than in Caucasian subjects [17](#bcp13219-bib-0017). We cannot rule out this possibility as individuals from Asia and Africa currently have a significant demographic presence in Italy.

Both recipients' and donors' *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* genotypes were tested by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test, and only the recipients' *CYP3A4* genotype showed equilibrium deviations (chi‐square = 8.28, *P* = 0.05). Sequencing confirmed the *CYP3A4* genotype in the paediatric liver transplant recipients.

In order to determine whether the deviation from equilibrium observed in the recipient paediatric population may have been due to genotyping errors, or to biological factors, *CYP3A4*22* SNP was confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products, and genotyping for *CYP3A4*22* SNP 262 was carried out on a healthy unrelated adult population of identical extraction. No deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (chi‐square = 0.83, *P* = 0.05) was observed in the control population. Therefore, the deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium observed in the *CYP3A4* genotyping of the paediatric recipient population may well have been due to the small number of patients.

### Influence of CYP3A4/5 combined‐genotype approach on tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation

Whole‐body metabolism on the first day after liver transplantation was investigated in the donor/recipient pairs through a *CYP3A4/5* combined‐genotype approach. Statistically different tacrolimus C_0_ values were detected between RM, EM and IM [4.1 (IQR 6.3) ng ml^–1^ RM *vs.* 9.2 (IQR 8.9) ng ml^–1^ EM, *P* < 0.005; 4.1 (IQR 6.3) ng ml^–1^ RM *vs.* 8.5 (IQR 8.5) ng ml^–1^ IM, *P* < 0.02] (Figure [3](#bcp13219-fig-0003)), while there were no statistically significant differences in the tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios. The difference in behaviour between tacrolimus C_0_ and concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios prompted the investigation of the influence of the *CYP3A4/5* combined‐genotype approach on tacrolimus disposition in the recipients (extrahepatic metabolism) and in donors (hepatic metabolism) on the first day after transplantation. In our opinion, the lack of statistical significance, when we compared the whole‐body metabolism groups according to the tacrolimus C_0_/weight‐adjusted dose, was possibly due to the physiological variables included in our statistical analysis.

### Figure 3.

![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ab58/5427244/6d9755595e3a/BCP-83-1252-g003.jpg)

RM, rapid metabolizer; EM, extensive metabolizer; IM, intermediate metabolizer. A P value of less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant

Indeed, no statistical differences in extrahepatic metabolism were observed between RM, EM and IM, stratified by the *CYP3A4/5* combined‐genotype approach. Instead, statistical differences were observed in hepatic metabolism between RM, EM and IM both for the tacrolimus C_0_ [3.0 (IQR 6.6) ng ml^–1^ RM *vs.* 8.5 (IQR 9.0) ng ml^–1^ EM, *P* < 0.003; 3.0 (IQR 6.6) ng ml^–1^ RM *vs.* 9.5 (IQR 7.1) ng ml^–1^ IM, *P* < 0.004] and for the concentration/weight‐adjusted dose [62 (IQR 68) ng ml^–1^ RM *vs.* 122 (IQR 103) ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^ EM, *P* < 0.003; 62 (IQR 68) ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^ RM *vs.* 184 (IQR 148) ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^ IM, *P* < 0.02].

### Effect of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 liver genotypes on tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation

As the recipient *CYP3A4/5* combined genotypes did not seem to play an important role in tacrolimus disposition in our paediatric population, we turned our attention to the donors' *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5* genotypes, investigating the contribution of these metabolic enzymes to tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation.

Patients carrying both liver *CYP3A4*22/*22* and **1/*22* were pooled, and a comparison was made between *CYP3A4*1/*1* and *CYP3A4*1/*22*‐**22/*22*. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups, either in tacrolimus C_0_ or in concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios. When the same statistical analysis was performed on liver *CYP3A5*1/*1*‐**1/*3* and *CYP3A5*3/*3* patients*,* statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in tacrolimus C_0_ [3.0 (IQR 5.3) ng ml^–1^ (**1/*1*‐**1/*3*) *vs.* 9.1 (IQR 8.6) ng ml^–1^ (**3/*3*); *P* < 0.0002] and concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios [62 (IQR 65) ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^ (**1/*1*‐**1/*3*) *vs.* 147 (IQR) 123 ng ml^–1^ dose^–1^ (**3/*3*); *P* < 0.0002] (Figure [4](#bcp13219-fig-0004)A and B).

The horizontal line in the middle indicates the median; the top and the bottom lines mark the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. A P value of less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant

### Interplay of recipient age, donor gender and donor CYP3A5 genotype on tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation

As recipient age, donor gender and donor *CYP3A5* genotype seem to play a role in tacrolimus disposition in our paediatric population on the first day after liver transplantation, we performed a statistical analysis to show the overall contribution of the donor *CYP3A5* genotype, donor gender and recipient age on tacrolimus disposition.

According to the general linear model, only the donor *CYP3A5* genotype and the recipient age were independently associated with tacrolimus disposition (*P* < 0.03 and *P* < 0.02, respectively), while the donor gender seemed to play a minor role.

## Discussion

Our data showed that, on the first day after transplantation, less than 8% of our paediatric liver transplant patients had a tacrolimus C_0_ within the therapeutic range (10–12 ng ml^–1^). In keeping with the assumption that an appropriate early systemic tacrolimus exposure is clinically relevant for a smooth post‐transplant course, it could be argued that the majority of our paediatric population may have been exposed to the risk of adverse drug‐related events, ranging from graft rejection to drug toxicity [6](#bcp13219-bib-0006).

Tacrolimus dosage underwent TDM in all patients, in order to reduce the time lag required to reach a stable tacrolimus C_0_ within the therapeutic range. However, relying on TDM‐guided dose adjustments means that the desired target concentrations are reached only days or even weeks after transplantation. To overcome this drawback, many authors have suggested that factors such as recipient age, baselinehistological score of the graft, co‐medication, creatinine clearance, *CYP3A5* genetic polymorphism and CYP3A4 expression rates of donors [15](#bcp13219-bib-0015), [18](#bcp13219-bib-0018), [19](#bcp13219-bib-0019), [20](#bcp13219-bib-0020) should be taken into account and guide the daily tacrolimus administration. This is particularly relevant on the first day after transplantation, when the tacrolimus dose is calculated according to body weight or body surface area and TDM has not yet been started.

A novel SNP located in intron 6 of the *CYP3A4* gene, *CYP3A4*22*, has been associated with reduced *CYP3A4* mRNA expression in the liver [10](#bcp13219-bib-0010) and its contribution to tacrolimus metabolism has been confirmed in kidney, heart and liver transplantation [11](#bcp13219-bib-0011), [12](#bcp13219-bib-0012), [21](#bcp13219-bib-0021). Our study investigated the role that *CYP3A4/5* combined genotypes play on tacrolimus C_0_ and concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio on the first day after liver transplantation in children. Concomitant drugs, graft–recipient weight ratio, gender and age were also taken into account. Graft–recipient weight ratio and co‐medications did not affect tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation in our paediatric liver transplant recipients. Our findings on the effect of co‐medications differed from those of other studies, where co‐administered drugs, in particular fluconazole, were reported to be the most important covariate influencing tacrolimus CL/F [21](#bcp13219-bib-0021). However, these studies investigated tacrolimus disposition in transplant patients over a longer time period, when drug induction and inhibition on the CYP450 system are more consistent. On the first day after liver transplantation, the effect of co‐medications on tacrolimus disposition may not be as relevant because of the length of time that these drugs need to exert their effect on the CYP450 enzymes.

Conversely, a gender effect was observed from the first post‐transplant day, as male donor grafts engendered lower tacrolimus C_0_ values and concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios than female donors, with median values below the therapeutic range. These data were in contrast with the results reported by others [22](#bcp13219-bib-0022), [23](#bcp13219-bib-0023), who observed significantly lower AUC values in female than in male adult kidney‐transplanted patients. Thangavel *et al*. also reported a female‐predominant expression of human CYP3A5 according to different levels of secretion of growth hormone (GH) in healthy male and female adults [24](#bcp13219-bib-0024). However, the differences between our results and those of Kuyper *et al*. [22](#bcp13219-bib-0022) and Velicković‐Radovanović *et al*. [23](#bcp13219-bib-0023) may well have been due to the differences in the study protocol: sampling time points, children *vs*. adults, liver *vs*. kidney transplantation. It should also be considered that liver dysfunction often leads to endocrine perturbations through the abolition of the balanced crosstalk between the endocrine system and the hepatic microenvironment. Indeed, some studies have shown anomalies in GH levels, possibly due to GH resistance, before liver transplantation, whereas the patients achieved an almost normal GH range only a week after the liver transplantation [25](#bcp13219-bib-0025), [26](#bcp13219-bib-0026), [27](#bcp13219-bib-0027), [28](#bcp13219-bib-0028). Therefore, we could speculate that at a very early stage after liver transplantation, GH hormonal perturbation might affect CYP3A5 enzyme expression in the donor liver, changing the physiological status of CYP3A5 enzyme induction. This alteration may have induced a higher CYP3A5 enzyme expression in male than in female liver grafts in our paediatric transplant population. However, according to our general linear model analysis, donor gender does not seem to influence tacrolimus disposition as much as donor *CYP3A5* genotype and recipient age.

The effect of age on tacrolimus disposition observed in our study were in agreement with that found in previous studies on paediatric renal and liver transplant recipients, with prepubertal children needing two to three times higher doses than adults [29](#bcp13219-bib-0029), [30](#bcp13219-bib-0030). Indeed, when we compared the tacrolimus concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratios in children who were younger or older than 6 years, we found a faster tacrolimus disposition in the younger group (Figure [2](#bcp13219-fig-0002)).

When recipient and donor tacrolimus metabolism (whole‐body metabolism) were considered, *CYP3A4/5* combined genotypes were strongly related to tacrolimus disposition on the first day after liver transplantation, but only to tacrolimus C_0_ (Figure [3](#bcp13219-fig-0003)). CYP3A4/5 RM exhibited approximately 50% lower tacrolimus C_0_ values than did IM or EM on the first day after liver transplantation, while most of the RM were below the therapeutic range (Figure [3](#bcp13219-fig-0003)). These data are in agreement with those reported in paediatric heart transplant recipients, where slow CYP3A4/5 metabolizers required almost 20% less tacrolimus than EM and approximately 50% less than RM [12](#bcp13219-bib-0012).

This discrepancy between tacrolimus C_0_ and concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio in tacrolimus whole‐body metabolism led us to analyse the *CYP3A4/5* genotypes in recipients (extrahepatic metabolism) and donors (hepatic metabolism) separately. A significant contribution to tacrolimus disposition, attributable to the donor liver, was observed. Conversely, recipient metabolism did not provide any significant contribution, thus confirming the crucial role that hepatic metabolism plays in tacrolimus disposition at a very early stage after liver transplantation [8](#bcp13219-bib-0008), [31](#bcp13219-bib-0031). Nevertheless, CYP‐dependent metabolism in children exceeds adult CYP activity, decreasing to adult levels at around puberty. Therefore, our finding that children under 6 years need higher doses of tacrolimus than adults might be influenced by extrahepatic metabolism and not by hepatic metabolism, as also reported by Uesugi *et al*. [32](#bcp13219-bib-0032). This might been explained by the quick recovery of CYP3A enzyme activity in the liver graft after transplantation [33](#bcp13219-bib-0033) and by different maturation changes in the ontogeny of CYP3A5 activity between children and adults [34](#bcp13219-bib-0034), [35](#bcp13219-bib-0035), [36](#bcp13219-bib-0036), together with the unique pathophysiological condition occurring in patients undergoing a liver transplantation, which may also play an important role [37](#bcp13219-bib-0037). Lastly, the *CYP3A4* genotype and *CYP3A5* genotype contribution to tacrolimus hepatic metabolism on the first day after liver transplantation were investigated separately. The importance of the *CYP3A5* genotype in tacrolimus disposition was confirmed, as most *CYP3A5*1/*1* and **1/*3* paediatric patients had tacrolimus concentrations under the therapeutic range, even at this very early stage after liver transplantation (Figure [4](#bcp13219-fig-0004)A and B), while the *CYP3A4* genotype played only a minor role. Our results partially contrasted with those of Guy‐Viterbo *et al*., who reported that the presence of the *CYP3A4*22* genotype in the liver donor decreased tacrolimus clearance by 29% [21](#bcp13219-bib-0021). This incongruity in the role of the *CYP3A4* genotype in tacrolimus disposition might be due to differences between the study protocols. Our study investigated the tacrolimus C_0_ and concentration/weight‐adjusted dose ratio just by one‐point blood sampling at a very early stage after liver transplantation, whereas Guy‐Viterbo *et al*. [21](#bcp13219-bib-0021) studied the *CYP3A4* genotype contribution by blood sampling at several points up to 90 days after liver transplantation. Therefore, in our opinion, a phenomenon such as phenoconversion [38](#bcp13219-bib-0038) or a difference in the recovery of CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 activity after liver transplantation might change the relative importance of CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 enzymes for tacrolimus disposition, the latter becoming more relevant over time. Consequently, it can be assumed that tacrolimus metabolism over time might be related to the recovery of liver function rather than to CYP3A5 enzyme activity [33](#bcp13219-bib-0033).

In conclusion, our study showed that the initial disposition of tacrolimus in paediatric liver transplant patients is influenced by the *CYP3A5* genotype of the liver donor, thus indicating not only that the CYP3A5 enzyme plays a greater role than the CYP3A4 enzyme in tacrolimus metabolism at this very early stage, but also that other physiological factors, mainly recipient age, may also play a role. This finding is in agreement with data reported in paediatric heart transplant recipients, where age and *CYP3A5* genotype were independently associated with the tacrolimus concentration/dose ratio [11](#bcp13219-bib-0011).

We acknowledge that the comparatively small size of our paediatric population was a limiting factor in our study, and that further research is required to support these preliminary findings. However, the present study suggests that, in paediatric patients under 6 years of age who receive a graft from a male EM, at least doubling the initial tacrolimus doses, when they are not yet TDM guided, may enhance the efficacy of immunosuppression.
