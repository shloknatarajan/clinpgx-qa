## Abstract

**Study Objectives:** 
To identify factors associated with variability in rifampin plasma pharmacokinetics and explore the relationship between rifampin pharmacokinetics and change in efavirenz plasma pharmacokinetics with rifampin coadministration.

**Methods:** 
In this randomized, cross-over study, 12 healthy volunteers received either efavirenz 600 mg/day or efavirenz 600 mg with rifampin 600 mg/day for 8 days. After a washout period of at least 2 weeks, subjects crossed over to the alternate 8-day regimen. Samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic assessment on day 8 of each study cycle. Drugs concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Multivariate analysis was used to examine factors associated with rifampin pharmacokinetics. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate relationship between rifampin pharmacokinetics and change in efavirenz plasma pharmacokinetics with rifampin coadministration.

**Measurements and Main Results:** 
Of 11 evaluable subjects, the median interquartile range (IQR) rifampin Cmax, AUC0-24h, and weight-normalized clearance were 8.9 (7.3-13.8) μg/mL, 48.8 (29.6-67.4) μg•hr/mL, and 0.19 (0.11-0.29) L/hr/kg, respectively. SLCO1B1c.388A→G and SLCO1B1c.463C→A polymorphisms jointly had significant effect on rifampin Cmax (R2=0.75). Male sex and SLCO1B1c.463C→A polymorphism together influenced rifampin AUC0-24h (R2=0.52) and weight-normalized clearance (R2=0.65). All four subjects with rifampin Cmax < 8 μg/mL (lower end of the normal range) had c.463CA genotype. Rifampin Cmax and AUC0-24h had no significant relationship with the efavirenz AUC0-24h ratio or weight-normalized clearance ratio in the presence versus absence of rifampin (P>0.05).

**Conclusions:** 
Males with the SLCO1B1c.463CA genotype are at increased risk of lower rifampin plasma exposure. However, plasma rifampin concentrations did not correlate with the extent of induction of efavirenz clearance by rifampin during coadministration.

### Study Objectives

To identify factors associated with variability in rifampin plasma pharmacokinetics and explore the relationship between rifampin pharmacokinetics and change in efavirenz plasma pharmacokinetics with rifampin coadministration.

### Methods

In this randomized, cross-over study, 12 healthy volunteers received either efavirenz 600 mg/day or efavirenz 600 mg with rifampin 600 mg/day for 8 days. After a washout period of at least 2 weeks, subjects crossed over to the alternate 8-day regimen. Samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic assessment on day 8 of each study cycle. Drugs concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Multivariate analysis was used to examine factors associated with rifampin pharmacokinetics. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate relationship between rifampin pharmacokinetics and change in efavirenz plasma pharmacokinetics with rifampin coadministration.

### Measurements and Main Results

Of 11 evaluable subjects, the median interquartile range (IQR) rifampin C_max_, AUC_0-24h_, and weight-normalized clearance were 8.9 (7.3-13.8) μg/mL, 48.8 (29.6-67.4) μg•hr/mL, and 0.19 (0.11-0.29) L/hr/kg, respectively. *SLCO1B1*c.388A→G and *SLCO1B1*c.463C→A polymorphisms jointly had significant effect on rifampin C_max_ (R^2^=0.75). Male sex and *SLCO1B1*c.463C→A polymorphism together influenced rifampin AUC_0-24h_ (R^2^=0.52) and weight-normalized clearance (R^2^=0.65). All four subjects with rifampin C_max_ < 8 μg/mL (lower end of the normal range) had c.463CA genotype. Rifampin C_max_ and AUC_0-24h_ had no significant relationship with the efavirenz AUC_0-24h_ ratio or weight-normalized clearance ratio in the presence versus absence of rifampin (*P*>0.05).

### Conclusions

Males with the *SLCO1B1*c.463CA genotype are at increased risk of lower rifampin plasma exposure. However, plasma rifampin concentrations did not correlate with the extent of induction of efavirenz clearance by rifampin during coadministration.

## Methods

### Study Population and Study Design

Stored plasma and DNA samples from 12 healthy volunteers who participated in a drug-drug interaction study to investigate the effect of rifampin on efavirenz pharmacokinetics,^16^ were used in the current study. The Institutional Review Board of Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island reviewed and approved the study. All subjects signed written informed consent, as well as specimen-banking consent for future analysis. All subjects were healthy, HIV-seronegative, self-identified as Caucasian or African-American, and had normal kidney and liver function and no significant medical conditions. Subjects were randomized based on ethnicity to efavirenz 600 mg daily or efavirenz 600 mg plus rifampin 600 mg daily on days 1 – 8. After sampling for efavirenz plasma concentrations on day 8 and at least a two-week washout period, subjects crossed-over to the alternate study regimen, and the procedures were repeated. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected on day 8 of each study period after at least an 8-hour fast. A light standard meal was provided after the 0.5 hour sampling. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after the final dose on day 8. Heparinized blood was centrifuged at 3000 RPM (1800 *g*) for 10 minutes and plasma separated and stored in labeled tubes at − 80°C until rifampin assay. The total duration of storage of samples until rifampin assay was 2 to 4 years.

### Sample and pharmacokinetic analysis

Rifampin plasma concentrations were determined using HPLC with UV detection as previously described.^11^ The standard curves for plasma rifampin concentrations covered a range of 0.5 to 50 μg/ml. The within-day precision (coefficient of variation [CV]) of validation quality control samples was 2.4% to 4.6%, and the overall validation precision was 6.3% to 7.1%. The absolute recovery of rifampin from serum was 95.5%. The observed C_max_ for each subject were observed by inspection of the serum concentration- time graphs. Calculations of the AUC from time 0 to 24hr (AUC_0–24hr_), apparent oral clearance (CL/F) clearance, and volume of distribution (Vz/F) were performed using noncompartmental analysis (Phoenix Software; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Efavirenz AUC_0-24h_ ratios (in the presence versus absence of rifampin) and body weight-normalized CL/F ratio used in the secondary analysis was previously reported.^16^

### Enzymes and nuclear receptor genotyping

Stored DNA was genotyped for *SLCO1B1*c.388G→A (**1b*, rs2306283), c.463C→A (**4*, rs11045819), c.521T→C (**5*, rs4149056), and rs4149032 (intron 2 haplotype tagging SNP; tSNP) using SNP genotyping kits (5′ nuclease assay, and TaqMan assay; Applied biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI PRISM 7300 HT system (Applied biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. Allelic frequencies were verified using published NCBI SNP database values. The genotype frequencies agreed with the predicted Hardy-Weinberg distribution.^18^

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using Software R for Windows 2.15.1 and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Multivariate analysis with variable selection by the Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) method,^19, 20^ based on 2-fold cross validation was used to find the effects of patient factors (sex, race, age, body mass index, and *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms) on rifampin pharmacokinetic parameters (C_max_, AUC, weight normalized CL/F and Vz/F). The reduced model was re-fitted for post-model selection inference. The SCAD approach has the oracle property, meaning that, in the asymptotic sense, they perform as well as if the analyst had known in advance which coefficients were zero and which were nonzero. Although the estimated coefficients of selected variables from post-model selection inference under current data setting may not be significant, the selected variables together have significant effect on the dependent variables, and their significance is guaranteed with a large sample size as suggested by the oracle property of the SCAD.^20^ The relationship between rifampin concentrations and efavirenz AUC and clearance (CL/F) ratio (in the presence versus absence of rifampin) was assessed by Spearman rank order correlation test. A *P* value < 0.05 was considered significant.

## Results

### Study population

Twelve subjects (6 Caucasian and 6 African American) completed the two arms of the study. Distribution of the selected *SLCO1B1* genetic polymorphisms among the 12 volunteers is shown in [Table 1](#T1). The distribution of the SNPs in the combined population was consistent with the predicted Hardy-Weinberg distribution (P < 0.05).

One of the 12 subjects (ID B003) had undetectable efavirenz concentrations and only trace levels of rifampin during coadministration. Because of suspected non-adherence to the study protocol, this subject was excluded from further analysis. The final study population of 11 subjects included 6 Caucasians and 5 African-Americans (6 females, 5 males). Median (IQR) baseline characteristics of the 11 subjects were age 43.0 (38.0 – 48.8) years, body weight 77.3 (60.7 – 84.6) kg, and body mass index (BMI) 25.2 (23.3 – 30.6) kg/m^2^. The dose of rifampin and efavirenz given to all subjects was 600 mg/day for each drug, median (IQR) 7.8 (7.1 – 9.9) mg/kg.

### Rifampin pharmacokinetics and factors associated with pharmacokinetic variability

The median (IQR) rifampin C_max_, AUC_0-24h_, weight normalized Vz/F, and weight normalized CL/F were 8.9 (7.3 – 13.8) μg/mL, 48.8 (29.6 – 67.4) μg•hr/mL, 0.45 (0.36 – 0.63) L/kg and 0.19 (0.11 – 0.29) L/hr/kg, respectively.

In multivariate analysis, *SLCO1B1* c.388A→G and *SLCO1B1* c.463C→A polymorphisms jointly had a significant effect on rifampin C_max_ (R^2^=0.75). The model fitting results from post-model selection inference suggested that the subject with the *SLCO1B1* c.388AA genotype had substantially higher rifampin C_max_ (32.8 μg/mL) compared to subjects with the GA or GG genotypes (9.6 and 12.4 μg/mL, respectively), and subjects with the *SLCO1B1* c.463CA genotype had lower median rifampin C_max_ (16.8 μg/mL) than those with the CC genotype (19.7 μg/mL). In addition, 4 of the 5 subjects with the *SLCO1B1* c.463CA genotype had rifampin C_max_ < 8 μg/mL (target threshold level); none of those with the CC genotype had rifampin C_max_ < 8 μg/mL. Male sex and the *SLCO1B1*c.463C→A polymorphism together influenced rifampin AUC_0-24h_ (R^2^=0.52), weight-normalized CL/F (R^2^=0.65), and weight-normalized Vz/F (R^2^=0.58) ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Males had lower median rifampin AUC_0-24h_ compared to females (36.6 vs. 68.1 μg•hr/mL), and subjects with the *SLCO1B1* c.463CA genotype had lower median AUC_0-24h_ than those with the c.463Cc genotype (38.3 vs. 66.4 μg•hr/mL). Conversely, males compared to females had higher median weight-normalized CL/F (0.26 vs. 0.16 L/hr/kg) and Vz/F (0.52 vs. 0.41 L/kg), while subjects with the *SLCO1B1* c.463CA genotype compared to those with the c.463Cc genotype had higher median weight-normalized CL/F (0.26 vs. 0.16 L/hr/kg) and Vz/F (0.59 vs. 0.34 L/kg).

The distribution of rifampin Cmax, AUC0-24h, weight-normalized CL/F, and weight-normalized Vz/F by SLCO1B1 c.463 C→A genotype status and sex. SLCO1B1 c.463 C→A genotype status and sex were joint predictors of rifampin AUC0-24h (R2=0.52), weight-normalized CL/F (R2=0.65), and weight-normalized Vz/F (R2=0.58).

### Correlation of rifampin pharmacokinetics and change in efavirenz pharmacokinetics

Individual efavirenz AUC_0-24h_ ratios (in the presence versus absence of rifampin) ranged from 0.55 to 1.18 (median ratio 0.85). Body weight-normalized CL/F ratios ranged from 0.79 to 11.41 (median ratio 1.16). Two of the 11 subjects had *CYP2B6* 516GG genotype, 7 had GT genotype and 2had TT genotype.,. As previously reported, the *CYP2B6* 516GT genotype status had no significant relationship with AUC_0-24h_ ratios or body weight-normalized CL/F ratios (in the presence versus absence of rifampin).^16^ We found no significant relationship between efavirenz AUC_0-24h_ ratio in the presence versus absence of rifampin and rifampin C_max_ (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.01, *P* = 0.99) or rifampin AUC_0-24h_ (r = 0.20, *P* = 0.56). Similarly, we found no significant relationship between weight-normalized efavirenz clearance ratio in the presence versus absence of rifampin and rifampin C_max_ (r = 0.17, *P* = 0.61) or AUC_0-24h_ (r = -0.07, *P* = 0.84).

## Discussion

This study investigated demographic and genetic factors associated with interindividual variability in rifampin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers who received rifampin 600 mg daily coadministered with efavirenz in a drug interaction study. In multivariate analysis, the *SLCO1B1*c.388A→G and *SLCO1B1* c.463C→A SNPs jointly influenced C_max_, while male sex and the *SLCO1B1* c.463C→A SNP were jointly associated with rifampin clearance and plasma exposure. Subjects with the *SLCO1B1* c.463CA genotype had higher median weight-adjusted clearance of rifampin and lower median C_max_ compared to those with CC genotype. All four subjects with rifampin C_max_ < 8 μg/mL (lower end of normal range) had the *SLCO1B1* c.463CA genotype. These findings substantiate the previous report that the *SLCO1B1* c.463C→A polymorphism is associated with lower rifampin C_max_.^11^

The uptake of rifampin from blood into hepatocytes is a key step in hepatobiliary elimination of the drug. Thus, variation in uptake transporter activity might be expected to influence rifampin pharmacokinetics and treatment responsiveness. Rifampin undergoes extensive hepatic deacetylation to form the 25-deacetylated metabolite.^21, 22^ Uptake of rifampin from the blood into hepatocytes is mediated by the organic transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) encoded by the *SLCO1B1* gene.^23, 24^ The mechanism for the increased rifampin clearance and lower plasma exposure in subjects with the *SLCO1B1* c.463CA genotype could be due to gain in transporter activity associated with the *SLCO1B1* c.463C→A (Pro155Thr) SNP, as previously demonstrated for lopinavir clearance.^25^ The high rifampin plasma concentrations observed for the subject homozygous for the *SLCO1B1* c.388A→G SNP in the current study is consistent with reduction in rifampin transport activity by the expression of OATP 1B1 variant *in vitro*.^24^ The *SLCO1B1* c.388A→G (Asn130Asp) SNP was associated with marked reduction in uptake of rifampin into HeLa cells.^24^ However, contrary to our findings, a larger study that included TB patients and healthy volunteers found no difference in rifampin exposure by *SLCO1B1* c.388A→G genotype status.^11^ The reason(s) for the discrepant findings are not clear, but could be due to the effect of yet unknown SNPs in the different study populations or drug-drug or drug-gene interactions, since the above-mentioned study^11^ included patients with active TB on multiple drug therapy. Also, we had just a single subject who was homozygous for the *SLCO1B1* c.388A→G variant in our study, and the results could have been due to chance. *SLCO1B1* c.521T→C (Val174Ala) SNPs have been reported to decrease rifampin cellular uptake into HeLa cells by decreasing the transporting activity of OATP1B1,^24^ but we did not observe any differences in rifampin pharmacokinetics *in vivo* by this polymorphism in our small study population. However, our findings are consistent with those of a previous study that found no significant difference in rifampin exposure or clearance with the *SLCO1B1* c.521T→C polymorphism.^11^

Rifampin is known to have variable drug-drug interactions with efavirenz, a substrate of CYP2B6. As a CYP2B6 enzyme inducer, rifampin would be expected to enhance efavirenz clearance and reduce plasma levels. However, some individuals have a paradoxical elevation of efavirenz concentration with rifampin coadministration.^15, 17, 26^ The paradoxical effect of rifampin coadministration on efavirenz pharmacokinetics has been associated in part with *CYP2B6* 561G→T polymorphisms,^26-28^ but it is unclear if lower rifampin plasma concentrations lead to less of an induction effect on efavirenz clearance during coadministration. We did not find a significant correlation between rifampin plasma C_max_ or AUC_0-24hr_ with the change in efavirenz AUC_0-24hr_ ratio or clearance ratio in the presence versus absence rifampin. Rifampin binds to the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) in cellular cytoplasm to form ligand-nuclear receptor complexes. This initiates a series of events that ultimately upregulate the expression and activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug transporter. ^29-31^ The lack of a linear relationship between rifampin concentration and magnitude of induction may suggest that either the inducing effect of rifampin is not concentration-dependent or it is maximized at a threshold concentration or dose. In fact, the extent of induction of drug metabolizing enzymes appears to be near maximal at a dose of 300 mg daily. Larger doses do not result in further induction.^29^ In addition, the induction effect of rifampin may be confounded by the effect of the *CYP2B6* genotype, because the slow metabolizing variants are not significantly induced by rifampin.^26-28^ In our sample of 11 subjects, *CYP2B6* 516G→T genotype status was not significantly associated with the change in the efavirenz AUC_0-24hr_ ratio or clearance ratio in the presence versus absence rifampin.^16^

The main limitation of our study was the small number of subjects with known functional genetic variants, which limited our ability to draw any firm conclusions about lack of association between rifampin pharmacokinetics and some of the *SLCO1B1* SNPs evaluated. In addition, we examined only four *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms and were not able to account for as yet unknown genetic or non-genetic factors in our multivariate analysis. A key strength of our analysis is the use of the SCAD variable selection for the multivariate analysis. The SCAD approach has the oracle property, meaning that, in the asymptotic sense, it performs as well as if the analyst had known in advance which coefficients were zero and which were nonzero. The SCAD approach removes non-informative variables by shrinking their coefficients to zero and efficiently selects the model with important variables only, which are different from the traditional variable-selection methods (predictor by predictor) associated with inefficiency and instability. Thus the estimated coefficients of selected variables from post-model selection inference under current data setting may not be significant. However, the selected variables together have a significant effect on the dependent variables, and their significance is guaranteed with a larger sample size as suggested by the oracle property of the SCAD.

In summary, our findings confirm that the *SLCO1B1* c.463C→A polymorphism is a significant determinant of low plasma rifampin C_max_. Because low rifampin C_max_ may influence TB treatment success,^32-34^ larger clinical studies are needed to evaluate the utility of genotyping for the *SLCO1B1* c.463C→A polymorphism to identify individuals at risk of low concentrations or poor treatment outcome. The lack of a significant relationship between rifampin plasma concentrations and extent of induction of efavirenz clearance suggests that higher rifampin plasma concentrations from higher dosages of rifampin may not necessarily lead to increased induction of efavirenz clearance, but this hypothesis need to be evaluated in studies evaluating higher doses of rifampin for TB treatment.
