## Abstract

**Background and Purpose:** 
Atherothrombotic diseases including stroke share a common etiology of atherosclerosis, and susceptibility to atherosclerosis has a genetic component. Stromelysin-1 (MMP3) regulates arterial matrix composition and is a candidate gene for atherothrombosis. A common polymorphism of MMP3 alters expression levels and affects atherosclerotic progression and plaque stability. As part of the GenHAT study, ancillary to ALLHAT, we evaluated the 5A/6A polymorphism in MMP3 to determine its association with stroke and determine if it modifies clinical outcome response to blood pressure lowering drugs.

**Methods:** 
The effect of the MMP3 5A/6A polymorphism on stroke rates were examined using multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models including testing interactions between genotype and antihypertensive drug class.

**Results:** 
Compared to participants treated with chlorthalidone with the 6A/6A genotype, individuals with the 6A/6A genotype randomized to lisinopril had higher stroke rates (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.61; P = 0.007), 5A/6A individuals taking lisinopril had lower stroke rates (HRinteraction = 0.74; Pinteraction = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.53-1.04), while 5A/5A individuals taking lisinopril had the lowest stroke rate (HRinteraction=0.51; Pinteraction=0.009; 95% CI, 0.31-0.85). There were no pharmacogenetic differences in stroke rate by genotype in patients taking amlodipine or doxazosin versus chlorthalidone.

**Conclusions:** 
The MMP3 6A/6A genotype is associated with an increased risk of stroke in hypertensive subjects taking lisinopril compared to patients treated with chlorthalidone, while a protective effect was found for 5A/5A individuals treated with lisinopril. Genetic screening for the MMP3 5A/6A genotype might be a useful tool to select optimal antihypertensive therapy if this finding is replicated.

### Background and Purpose

Atherothrombotic diseases including stroke share a common etiology of atherosclerosis, and susceptibility to atherosclerosis has a genetic component. Stromelysin-1 (MMP3) regulates arterial matrix composition and is a candidate gene for atherothrombosis. A common polymorphism of MMP3 alters expression levels and affects atherosclerotic progression and plaque stability. As part of the GenHAT study, ancillary to ALLHAT, we evaluated the 5A/6A polymorphism in MMP3 to determine its association with stroke and determine if it modifies clinical outcome response to blood pressure lowering drugs.

### Methods

The effect of the MMP3 5A/6A polymorphism on stroke rates were examined using multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models including testing interactions between genotype and antihypertensive drug class.

### Results

Compared to participants treated with chlorthalidone with the 6A/6A genotype, individuals with the 6A/6A genotype randomized to lisinopril had higher stroke rates (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.61; *P* = 0.007), 5A/6A individuals taking lisinopril had lower stroke rates (HR_interaction_ = 0.74; *P*_interaction_ = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.53-1.04), while 5A/5A individuals taking lisinopril had the lowest stroke rate (HR_interaction_=0.51; *P*_interaction_=0.009; 95% CI, 0.31-0.85). There were no pharmacogenetic differences in stroke rate by genotype in patients taking amlodipine or doxazosin versus chlorthalidone.

### Conclusions

The MMP3 6A/6A genotype is associated with an increased risk of stroke in hypertensive subjects taking lisinopril compared to patients treated with chlorthalidone, while a protective effect was found for 5A/5A individuals treated with lisinopril. Genetic screening for the MMP3 5A/6A genotype might be a useful tool to select optimal antihypertensive therapy if this finding is replicated.

## Introduction

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of long-term disability. There are approximately 700,000 stroke cases per year, and estimates of the annual burden placed on health care costs by stroke range between $30 and $50 billion.^1^

In addition to numerous lifestyle risk factors, atherosclerosis^2-4^ and hypertension^5,6^ are central to the pathogenesis of stroke. Changes in the composition of the arterial matrix are among the primary mechanisms underlying this progression. As atherosclerosis and hypertension persist, there is a reduction in the ratio of elastin to collagen in the arterial matrix, reducing arterial compliance and increasing blood pressure.^7^ Stromelysin-1 (MMP3) is an important enzymatic regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling secreted predominantly by connective tissue cells.^8^ MMP3 cleaves several types of collagen at various sites in the helical domain, and degrades other constituents of the extracellular matrix, including proteoglycan, fibronectin, and laminin.^9^ Since hypertension is a major cause of atherosclerotic remodeling of the large arteries, and also the most important stroke risk factor, we chose stroke as the outcome through which to test for an antihypertension pharmacogenetic effect of MMP3.

A common polymorphism, MMP3 5A/6A, consisting of either 5 or 6 adenosine residues is located in the IL-1 response element of the MMP3 promoter region. The 6A allele is associated with decreased MMP3 expression^10, 11^ and more rapid progression of atherosclerosis,^10, 12-14^ presumably due to collagen buildup in the arterial matrix. Other studies have directly linked increased MMP3 expression and 5A alleles to plaque instability and MI,^15-19^ and heterozygotes are thought to have the optimal balance of matrix accumulation and degradation.^11^ Although 6A alleles have been shown to predispose individuals to carotid artery stenosis, a known stroke risk factor,^20-22^ no studies have directly linked either allele to stroke risk.

## Materials and Methods

### Study Design

The Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) is a practice-based, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized clinical trial with 42,418 high-risk hypertensives randomized in 623 clinical centers. Participants are 55 years of age or older, with systolic or diastolic hypertension and one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Blood pressure eligibility for ALLHAT was based on current antihypertensive medication use and/or the average of two seated measurements during two pre-randomization visits. For patients currently on blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs, the systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) could not exceed 160/100 mmHg at first visit or 180/110 mmHg at second visit. Patients were eligible if they met any of the inclusion criteria (in addition to diagnosis of hypertension). Inclusion criteria were ST-T wave electrocardiogram changes indicative of ischemia, history of coronary revascularization, angina pectoris, other documented atherosclerotic disease, type 2 diabetes, HDL cholesterol < 35mg/dl (any two determinations in past 5 yrs), current smoking, combined ECG wall thickness of 0.25 mm measured in the past 2 years, and ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in past 2 years. Exclusion criteria were symptomatic MI, stroke, or angina pectoris within the past 6 months, symptomatic heart failure or ejection fraction ≤ 35%, non-hypertensive indications for an aversion to the drugs being tested in ALLHAT, requirement for more than 2 medications to control BP, sensitivity/contraindications to any of the first line study medications, serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl, low likelihood of compliance with the study protocol, serious illness likely to lead to non-cardiac death during trial, or current participant in another clinical trial.

Participants were randomized to one of four treatment arms, chlorthalidone, lisinopril, amlodipine, and doxazosin in a ratio of 1.7:1:1:1 respectively. They were initially started on the lowest possible dose of each agent, and dosages were increased until blood pressure control was achieved (SBP less than 140 and DBP less than 90 mmHg). If blood pressure control was not achieved at maximum study medication dose, a second line, open-label agent (reserpine, clonidine, or atenolol) and/or a third-line, open label agent (hydralazine) was added.

After blood pressure goals were met and medication regimens stabilized, clinic visits were scheduled at three-month intervals during the first year and four month intervals thereafter. Blood pressure was measured at each visit. Lab measurements, including potassium, glucose, creatinine, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and alanine aminotransferase were measured after an eight-hour fast at years 1, 2, 4, and 6.

The primary outcome for ALLHAT was a composite measure including coronary heart disease (CHD) death and non-fatal MI. Major secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal stroke, combined CHD defined by coronary revascularization or hospitalized angina, combined CVD defined by combined CHD, stroke, other treated angina, heart failure, or peripheral arterial disease, and end-stage renal disease defined by dialysis, renal transplantation, or death from kidney disease. For this analysis, we focused on one secondary outcome, fatal and non-fatal stroke, which included ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Outcomes were ascertained at clinic visits and through national databases and death certificates and hospitalization records were used to support clinician-assigned outcomes.

In the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatment (GenHAT) study, variants in candidate genes were typed in ALLHAT participants in an attempt to determine whether these genes interact with antihypertensive medications to modify the risks of developing adverse cardiovascular endpoints. Of the original ALLHAT sample, 39,114 had DNA available and were included in GenHAT. This research was approved by local Institutional Review Boards, and informed consent was collected from all participants in ALLHAT.

### Genotyping

DNA was isolated and immobilized on FTA paper (Fitzco Inc, Maple Plain, MN). PCR amplification was done on 96-well plates using robotic workstations and multichannel pipettes using positive and negative controls. The MMP3 polymorphism was genotyped in the context of a larger panel of cardiovascular disease candidate gene variants, so each sample was amplified in a multiplex polymerase chain reaction and then hybridized to an array of immobilized, sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA) according to the methods described by Cheng et al.^23^

### Statistical Analysis

Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equilibrium tests were performed using chi-square tests. The MMP3 5A/6A polymorphism was analyzed in multivariate Cox regression models using stroke as the outcome. The polymorphism was initially tested as three-level categorical predictor (representing two homozygous and one heterozygous genotype). In addition, we compared 6A/6A individuals to those with 6A/5A or 5A/5A, and also 5A/5A individuals to those with 6A/5A or 6A/6A. Finally, as there is previous evidence suggesting that individuals who are heterozygous for the MMP3 5A/6A polymorphism may have the lowest cardiovascular risk profile^11^, we tested a model comparing heterozygotes to homozygotes for the polymorphism. For the fully adjusted model potential covariates including age, gender, race, smoking and diabetes status, blood pressure (SBP and DBP), total cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), aspirin use, and antihypertensive treatment group were added. These covariates were chosen based on previous evidence suggesting they may influence stroke risk. Those found significant (*P* ≤ .05) were retained in the final model. We also tested for interactions between the MMP3 gene and age, sex, race, diabetes status, and smoking, as these were pre-specified subgroups within ALLHAT, and also for interactions between treatment group and the 5A/6A polymorphism. The complete results for each genotypic model and interaction test are shown in [supplementary Table S1](#SD1).

In total, 78 variants were typed in the GenHAT study, which would normally require *P*-values on the order of 0.001 to meet Bonferroni adjusted significance thresholds. Since only the MMP3 variant was analyzed in the current study, less conservative adjustment methods such as computing false discovery rates were not feasible. We therefore use the Bonferroni adjusted significance threshold as a general guideline, knowing that it is likely overly conservative.

Since the focus of this analysis is primary stroke prevention, we excluded 9076 participants with a history of stroke or MI at baseline. This also allows us to use a cumulative incidence analysis approach and minimizes potential bias due to changes in lifestyle and risk factor profile following one of these events. Since the doxazosin arm of the trial was halted early, these data are not directly comparable to the other three arms and we therefore excluded participants randomized to this drug. We tested for pharmacogenetic effects of the MMP3 variant on this drug, however, in a subset of the data that only contains information collected before the time that the doxazosin arm was halted. All other results presented do not include data from the doxazosin group.

## Results

The results of the ALLHAT trial with regard to stroke have been previously published.^24^ Briefly, rates of stroke were higher in patients randomized to lisinopril than chlorthalidone (6.3% vs. 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30). This finding was primarily observed in AA participants and probably mediated at least in part by higher BP in African American (AA) subjects assigned to lisinopril. The number of individuals with complete genotype and phenotype information, after excluding 9076 individuals with a history of stroke or MI prior to baseline and those randomized to doxazosin, was 21,309. The average follow-up time was 4.6 years. Individuals with the 5A/6A genotype had the lowest unadjusted stroke rates (6.8 per 1000 person-years (PY)), followed by 5A/5A individuals (7.5 per 1000 PY). Individuals with the 6A/6A genotype had the highest stroke rates (11.1 per 1000 PY). [Table 1](#T1) shows the means and standard deviations of baseline levels of continuous traits and percents for categorical variables by MMP3 5A/6A genotype. The means and percents for potential confounding factors were highly similar across genotypic classes. Age, gender, AA race, SBP, DBP, total cholesterol, current smoking, and diabetes status were significant stroke predictors (*P* ≤ 0.05) and retained as covariates in final models.

MMP3 allele frequencies differed significantly in by race, with 5A alleles much more common in European Americans (EAs). [Table 3](#T3) shows the 5A/6A genotype frequencies by race. The overall stroke rate was 8.2 per 1000 person-years in the whole sample and 8.0 per 1000 person-years in people with no previous stroke or MI. There was no significant association between any MMP3 genotypes and stroke rate after multivariate adjustment. Also, AA participants showed a small but significantly greater response (2.2 mmHg change in SBP between baseline and 6 months, *P* < 0.0001) to treatment compared to other race groups' reduction in SBP after adjustment for multiple factors including baseline SBP. The MMP3 polymorphism was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in AA (P = 0.008) or EAs (P = 0.00004).

In light of the difference in allele frequency between EAs and AAs and the apparent interaction between treatment and genotype, we wanted to determine if race could act as a surrogate for genotype information to inform first line treatment options. To do so, we compared the fit between a model containing genotype × treatment interaction terms and a model containing a genotype × treatment term and a genotype × race term, but the model fit was not significantly improved. Also, the race × treatment interaction term was highly significant, with AAs on lisinopril showing increased stroke risk (HR = 1.81; *P* = 0.0002; 95% CI, 1.33-2.45). These analyses indicate race may be a valid surrogate for MMP genotype for informing treatment choice. We also tested for the genotype by treatment interaction in the AA and EA groups separately. The interaction results were neither significant nor distinguishable from the combined race results (as determined by the overlap of the 95% confidence intervals from the hazard ratios). These results are shown in [supplementary Table S1](#SD1).

There was a nominally significant interaction between MMP3 genotype and antihypertensive treatment group in predicting stroke rates, although the associated *P*-values do not meet a Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold. [Figure 1](#F1) shows a plot of stroke HR by treatment group and genotype, illustrating the observed interaction. Each combination of genotype and drug treatment was compared to a common reference group, 6A/6A individuals randomized to chlorthalidone. In a multivariate-adjusted model, the interaction term between 5A/6A genotype and lisinopril treatment was not significant (HR = 0.74; *P* = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.53-1.04), but the interaction term for 5A/5A individuals on lisinopril was nominally significant (HR = 0.51; *P* = 0.009; 95% CI, 0.31-0.85). There were no pharmacogenetic differences in stroke rate by genotype in patients taking amlodipine versus chlorthalidone, nor doxazosin versus chlorthalidone. Also, there were no main effects of MMP3 genotype on stroke rate in any of the subgroups, nor were there any significant genotype by subgroup interactions after correcting for multiple tests.

Results based on the treatment by genotype interaction term from a Cox regression model adjusted for age, total cholesterol, African American race, sex, current smoking, SBP, DBP, and diabetes status. The MMP3 polymorphism was modeled as a three-level (genotypic) factor. All hazard ratios and P-values are in reference to individuals with the 6A/6A genotype who were randomized to chlorthalidone.

The hazard ratios for stroke and *P*-values associated with the MMP3 -lisinopril versus chlorthalidone interaction terms were similar whether or not we adjusted for the change in blood pressure between the first visit and after six months of treatment. The consistency of the findings before and after control for blood pressure lowering suggests that the differential stroke rates are not solely due to differential blood pressure lowering.

## Discussion

We found a novel pharmacogenetic effect of the MMP3 genotype for stroke outcomes, and our findings suggest that ACE inhibition is more effective treatment than chlorthalidone for hypertensives homozygous for the MMP3 5A allele, while chlorthalidone is more efficacious than lisinopril for hypertensives heterozygous for the 6A allele. The mechanism for this pharmacogenetic effect is not entirely clear. Previous data indicate that 6A alleles correspond to lower expression levels, greater matrix deposition, and more rapid progression of atherosclerosis, whereas homozygosity for the 5A allele lead to over-expression and plaque instability. Although not replicated in this subset of the data, ALLHAT results indicated that in the lisinopril group there was significantly increased risk of stroke compared to chlorthalidone. This effect may be partially mediated by MMP3 genotype. Although there was no significant association between MMP3 genotype and stroke, we found that the 5A/6A polymorphism heterozygous individuals had the lowest stroke rates, consistent with previous studies of the variant's effect on various cardiovascular traits^10, 12-22^.

In addition to the expected difference in stroke rates between AA and EA participants, this large, multiethnic sample shows marked differences in several other factors across ethnic groups. The most striking is the difference in MMP3 5A/6A allele frequencies across ethnic groups, with 5A alleles being much more common in EAs than in the other ethnic groups. The greater proportion of heterozygotes in EA participants may explain part of the increased stroke rates in AAs.

There were differences in compliance rates between some of the study drugs, and also in the number of participants requiring a second, open label treatment. Doxazosin and Lisinopril had lower compliance rates than the other drugs, as well as higher rates of additional medications required. [Table 2](#T2) shows the compliance and second line treatment rates by randomized drug group. Also, there were differences in the number of participants initially assigned to each treatment group who required an additional, open-label antihypertensive drug. At 1 year and 5 years, more participants assigned to chlorthalidone and amlodipine continued study medication than participants that were assigned to lisinopril. Additionally, at both 1 year and 5 years, more participants assigned to lisinopril received open-label medication (32.6% at year 1 and 43.0% at year 5) than those assigned to chlorthalidone (26.7% at year 1 and 40.7% at year 5) or amlodipine (25.9% at year 1 and 39.5% at year 5). In the ALLHAT cohort among the two treatment groups of interest for this analysis, lisinopril and chlorthalidone, 5.8% of the chlorthalidone group were also taking a CCB and 9.3% an ACE inhibitor in addition to the randomized drug at 5 years. In the Lisinopril group, 15.7% were taking an ACE inhibitor with a diuretic at 5 years^13^. The most common second line agent for all race and treatment subgroups was atenolol (21%–29%), followed by hydralazine (8%–22%). In the chlorthalidone group, 25% of AA and 35% of non-AA were prescribed atenolol. Among AAs, 25% of the lisinopril group received a diuretic and 17%, a CCB. Among non-AA, a diuretic was prescribed for 21% of lisinopril participants ^25^.

## Strengths and Limitations

These analyses represent the largest sample to date used to test the MMP3 5A/6A promoter polymorphism for association with stroke and for interaction with antihypertensive treatment. Since this was a randomized, prospective study we avoid the limitations of case-control designs while retaining sufficient power to detect genetic associations and interactions with treatment and lifestyle factors.

Despite these strengths, some limitations exist. First, no differentiation was made between stroke subtypes, and heterogeneity within the combined stroke phenotype could have limited our power to detect association. However, since all stroke subtypes are caused in part by atherosclerosis, the pathway through which MMP3 acts, any power loss would likely be minimal. Second, although previous evidence shows MMP3 genotype changes expression level, we had no expression data to validate this in the GenHAT sample.

Although we tested for stroke risk associated with a single genetic polymorphism with well-documented effects on gene expression and multiple cardiovascular diseases, we tested several genetic models and also for interactions with several risk factors, and therefore multiple comparisons become an issue. Given 4 modes of inheritance (3 with 1 degree of freedom (d.f.), and 1 with 2 d.f.) were tested, with the addition of a categorical (2 d.f.) genetic model for interactions with 5 variables, we conducted 15 tests in the initial analysis. A simple Bonferroni correction for the tests conducted here would require a *P*-value of 0.003 for significance, which was not met by any of the tests. To adjust for all 78 tests conducted in the larger GenHAT study would require a threshold of 0.0006. This threshold is likely conservative since the different genetic models are not independent tests. Also, most of the variants tested in GenHAT have established effects on protein function or expression levels. We therefore assume more prior evidence for true positive associations than for the non-functional tag SNPs that make up the bulk of markers tested in many genome wide association studies. Still, the likelihood that these findings are false positives is not negligible, and independent replication is necessary.

Confounding due to population stratification is also a potential problem. Although analyses were adjusted for African American race, there may be additional population strata within race groups. A recent simulation study showed that the magnitude of this bias is small unless extreme differences exist in genotype frequency, and the magnitude of bias decreases as the number of admixed ethnicities increases. In addition, bias due to population stratification may be small when baseline risk differences are small within major categories of admixed ethnicity^26^. Finally, the MMP3 polymorphism was not in HWE in the sample, which could indicate a systematic genotyping error.

## Summary

In summary, these data from the GenHAT study show that the MMP3 5A/6A genotype may be a useful genetic marker for determining who should avoid lisinopril in favor of cholrthalidone as first line treatment for hypertension in terms of stroke prevention. Specifically, our results suggest lisinopril rather than chlorthalidone may not be as efficacious as a hypertension treatment option in patients with the MMP3 6A/6A genotype, but is more efficacious in hypertensives with the MMP3 5A/5A genotype. In heterozygotes, lisinopril treatment appears identical to chlorthalidone for stroke prevention, and there was no statistical difference between stroke rates between these drugs among MMP3 5A homozygotes. The observed effects are quite small, however, and would have to be replicated in an independent sample to before any changes in treatment are warranted. Our results also indicate that race may be a potential surrogate for MMP3 genotype in informing treatment choice.
