## Abstract

**Aim:** 
First, evaluate if patients carrying putatively diminished activity CYP2C8 genotype have longer paclitaxel exposure (e.g., time above threshold concentration of 0.05 μM [Tc >0.05]). Second, screen additional pharmacogenes for associations with Tc >0.05.

**Methods:** 
Pharmacogene panel genotypes were translated into genetic phenotypes for associations with Tc >0.05 (n = 58).

**Results:** 
Patients with predicted low-activity CYP2C8 had shorter Tc >0.05 after adjustment for age, body surface area and race (9.65 vs 11.03 hrs, β = 5.47, p = 0.02). This association was attributed to CYP2C8*3 (p = 0.006), not CYP2C8*4 (p = 0.58). Patients with predicted low-activity SLCO1B1 had longer Tc >0.05 (12.12 vs 10.15 hrs, β = 0.85, p = 0.012).

**Conclusion:** 
Contrary to previous publications, CYP2C8*3 may confer increased paclitaxel metabolic activity. SLCO1B1 and CYP2C8 genotype may explain some paclitaxel pharmacokinetic variability.

### Aim:

First, evaluate if patients carrying putatively diminished activity *CYP2C8* genotype have longer paclitaxel exposure (e.g., time above threshold concentration of 0.05 μM [T_c >0.05_]). Second, screen additional pharmacogenes for associations with T_c >0.05_.

### Methods:

Pharmacogene panel genotypes were translated into genetic phenotypes for associations with T_c >0.05_ (n = 58).

### Results:

Patients with predicted low-activity CYP2C8 had shorter T_c >0.05_ after adjustment for age, body surface area and race (9.65 vs 11.03 hrs, β = 5.47, p = 0.02). This association was attributed to *CYP2C8*3* (p = 0.006), not *CYP2C8*4* (p = 0.58). Patients with predicted low-activity SLCO1B1 had longer T_c >0.05_ (12.12 vs 10.15 hrs, β = 0.85, p = 0.012).

### Conclusion:

Contrary to previous publications, *CYP2C8*3* may confer increased paclitaxel metabolic activity. *SLCO1B1* and *CYP2C8* genotype may explain some paclitaxel pharmacokinetic variability.

## Methods

### Patient cohort

Patients with breast cancer receiving weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2^ 1-h infusions were enrolled in an observational clinical registry (UMCCC 2014.002, [NCT02338115](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02338115)) assessing paclitaxel exposure during the first dose and paclitaxel-induced PN. Detailed information about these patients, treatment, sampling time points and the primary analyses have been previously reported [[5](#B5)]. Briefly, eligible women were >18 years old, had a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, and were scheduled to receive Cremophor EL-based paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2^ 1-h infusions weekly for 12 weeks with a curative intent. The study was approved by the University of Michigan IRBMed and conducted in accordance with recognized ethical guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Belmont report. All enrolled subjects signed written informed consent.

### Sample & data collection

Patient demographic and treatment information was collected at baseline including age, race, ethnicity and limited medical history. Blood samples were collected at the first paclitaxel infusion for a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, and extraction of genomic DNA. Additional blood samples were collected within 10 min prior to the end of the first paclitaxel infusion and 16–26 h after infusion for PK analyses. The end of infusion sample was collected from the peripheral vein contralateral to the infusion and the 16–26 h level was collected from a peripheral vein or a properly flushed port. Samples were collected in Na-Heparin tubes, immediately placed on ice, and centrifuged within 10 min of collection. Plasma was transferred to a secondary cryotube and stored at -20°C until analysis.

### Pharmacokinetic methodology

Total paclitaxel concentration was measured in plasma samples by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy by the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy Pharmacokinetics Core. T_c >0.05_ was calculated using the MyCare^™^ Dose Exposure Calculator (Saladax Biomedical, Inc, PA, USA). MyCare Dose Exposure Calculator is a PC-based software that uses Phoenix WinNonlin modeling software (Certara USA, Inc., NJ, USA) to determine exposure to therapeutic agents based on a previously published population-PK model [[21](#B21)]. The following parameters were used to calculate T_c >0.05_: absolute dose of paclitaxel (in mg), infusion start and end time, time of sample collection and sample concentration. The concentration determined from the plasma sample collected at the end of infusion was used as C_max_.

### Genotyping & activity phenotype prediction

DNA samples were genotyped for 266 variants in 36 genes relevant to drug metabolism and transport on the iPLEX ADME PGx ProPanel by Agena Bioscience (CA, USA). All genetic information was subjected to appropriate quality control including assessment of sample call rate. Similar to our previous publication [[22](#B22)], each allele was translated into a predicted activity (low, normal and high) based on published data ([Supplementary Table 1](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2018-0162/suppl_file/pgs-20-95-s1.docx)). Then, each patient's diplotype was translated into a predicted activity phenotype: PM, IM, NM or UM, for analysis ([Supplementary Table 2](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2018-0162/suppl_file/pgs-20-95-s1.docx)). Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was confirmed for all variants included in significant findings from the primary and secondary analyses using a χ^2^ test with simulated p-value based on 10,000 replicates, which was performed using R.

### Statistical analysis

All patients with available genetic and exposure (T_c >0.05_ and C_max_) data were included in the analysis. For the primary analysis, genotype-predicted CYP2C8 activity was tested in a dominant model (PM/IM vs NM) for an association with T_c >0.05_. The secondary analysis was conducted using an additive model for associations between T_c >0.05_ and C_max_ with the following genes with known relevance to paclitaxel metabolism or transport: *CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B1* and *SLCO1B3*. Finally, all remaining genes analyzed by the iPLEX ADME chip with no known relevance to paclitaxel metabolism or transport: *COMT, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, DPYD, GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTT2b, NAT1, NAT2, SLC15A2, SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A6, SLCO2B1, SULT1A1, TPMT, UGT1A1, UGT2B15, UGT2B17, UGT2B7, VKORC1*, were included in a hypothesis generating screen for associations with T_c >0.05_ or C_max_. For the secondary analysis and the hypothesis generating screen, if the number of patients in an extreme genetic phenotype (PM or UM) was less than three, that phenotype was collapsed into the next phenotype level (i.e., PM/IM or NM/UM). Additional post-hoc analyses were conducted to investigate associations for individual *CYP2C8* genotypes (*CYP2C8*3* or *CYP2C8*4*) with T_c >0.05_. For the analysis of each variant, patients who were heterozygous (i.e., *CYP2C8*1/*3*) or homozygous (i.e., *CYP2C8*3/*3*) for that variant were compared only to patients homozygous for the wild-type genotype (i.e., *CYP2C8*1/*1*) by excluding all carriers of the alternative variant. Clinical variables used in the analysis included age and BSA as continuous variables, race (Caucasian or other), alkaline phosphatase (elevated >116 IU/l), aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase (elevated >40 IU/l), albumin (low ≤3.0 g/dl), prior or concurrent pertuzumab/trastuzumab therapy and prior or concurrent chemotherapy as categorical variables. The associations between genetic phenotype or clinical variables and the C_max_ and logarithm of T_c >0.05_ were analyzed using univariate linear regression with an unadjusted α = 0.05 (two-sided). None of the clinical covariates was significant in the univariate association, therefore, genetic associations were adjusted for the putatively relevant covariates age, race and BSA. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.4.

## Results

### Patient demographic, PK, & genetic data

After excluding one patient that received a 3-h paclitaxel infusion, 56 and 58 patients were included in the T_c >0.05_ and C_max_ analyses, respectively ([Figure 1](#F0001)). Patient demographic data and relevant baseline laboratory levels are included in [Table 1](#T1). The mean age of the patients was 51.4 years (standard deviation [SD]: 12.55), mean BSA was 1.82 m^2^ (SD 0.21), and 93.2% of patients self-reported as Caucasian ([Table 1](#T1)). The mean T_c >0.05_ and C_max_ was 10.72 h (n = 58, SD 2.73) and 2390.18 ng/ml (n = 56, SD 640.85), respectively.

*CYP2C8* diplotype was determined for all patients included in the analysis. For the 57 patients included in the primary analysis, the distribution of *CYP2C8* diplotypes and corresponding genetic phenotypes was: 40 *CYP2C8*1/*1* (NM), 11 *CYP2C8*1/*3* (IM), 3 *CYP2C8*1/*4* (IM), 1 *CYP2C8*3/*3* (PM), 1 *CYP2C8*3/*4* (PM) and 1 *CYP2C8*4/*4* (PM), resulting in a phenotype distribution of 3 PMs (5%), 14 IMs (25%) and 40 NMs (70%). No patients were carriers of *CYP2C8*2, *5, *7* or **8*. The *CYP2C8* and *SLCO1B1* variants were confirmed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and the minor allele frequency was similar to that expected for a primarily Caucasian population.

### Associations of clinical & genetic variables with Tc >0.05

In the primary analysis, patients with low-activity CYP2C8 genetic phenotype (PM or IM) had shorter T_c >0.05_ (PM/IM mean = 9.65 h, NM mean = 11.03 h, linear regression β-coefficient = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.01–1.28, p = 0.046, [Table 2](#T2) & [Figure 2](#F0002) left). None of the clinical variables were associated with T_c >0.05_; however, associations for increasing BSA (β = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.96–1.68, p = 0.10) and Caucasian race (β = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.97–1.53, p = 0.09, [Table 3](#T3)) with longer T_c >0.05_ approached significance. The association with CYP2C8 maintained significance after adjustment for age, BSA and race (β = 5.47, 95% CI: 2.99–9.99, p = 0.020).

Table 3 Caption: BSA: Body surface area; SD: Standard deviation.

In a *post-hoc* analysis to understand the contribution of individual genotypes, the association for low-activity CYP2C8 genetic phenotype was attributable to the *CYP2C8*3* polymorphism (*CYP2C8*1/*3* or *CYP2C8*3/*3* mean = 8.92 h, *CYP2C8*1/*1* mean = 11.03 h, p = 0.0006). Although the numbers for analysis was quite small, there was no association between *CYP2C8*4* and T_c >0.05_ (*CYP2C8*1/*4* or *CYP2C8*4/*4* mean = 10.25 h, **1/*1* mean = 11.03 h, p = 0.58).

In the secondary analysis of genes relevant to paclitaxel metabolism or transport, patients with lower low-activity OATP1B1 genetic phenotype had longer T_c >0.05_ (PM/IM = 12.12 h, NM = 10.15 h, β = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03–1.33, p = 0.014, [Table 2](#T2) & [Figure 2](#F0002) right) and this association maintained significance after adjustment for relevant clinical covariates (β = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75–0.96, p = 0.012). A model containing both *CYP2C8* and *SLCO1B1* maintained independent effects for *SLCO1B1* (*SLCO1B1*: p = 0.01, *CYP2C8*: p = 0.09). In the hypothesis generating screen of genes with no known relevance to paclitaxel PK, patients with lower UGT2B17 activity had shorter T_c >0.05_ (β = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04–1.22, p = 0.003) and patients with lower CYP2C9 activity had shorter T_c >0.05_ (β = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03–1.26, p = 0.014, [Supplementary Table 3](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2018-0162/suppl_file/pgs-20-95-s1.docx)). None of the other genes were associated with T_c >0.05_.

### Associations of clinical & genetic variables with Cmax

Increasing age was associated with higher C_max_ (β = 15.15, 95% CI: 1.88–28.42, p = 0.026, [Table 3](#T3)). None of the genes from the candidate list or hypothesis generating screen, including *CYP2C8*, were associated with C_max_ ([Supplementary Table 3](http:///doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs-2018-0162/suppl_file/pgs-20-95-s1.docx)), although the association for patients with lower activity *SLC15A2* genetic phenotype and higher C_max_ approached significance (β = -237.36, 95% CI: -473.72 to -1.00, p = 0.054).

## Discussion

Patients carrying putatively diminished-activity *CYP2C8* variants, including *CY2C8*3*, have been reported to have slower paclitaxel clearance [[9](#B9),[10](#B10)] and greater risk of paclitaxel-induced PN [[10](#B10),[17](#B17),[18](#B18),[23](#B23)]. In this cohort we previously reported that patients with longer T_c >0.05_ had greater risk of PN [[5](#B5)]. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that patients with low-activity CYP2C8 genetic phenotype would have longer T_c >0.05_. Contrary to our primary hypothesis, low-activity CYP2C8 genetic phenotype was associated with significantly shorter T_c >0.05_.

Two human PK studies have reported decreased paclitaxel clearance in patients carrying *CYP2C8* **3* [[9](#B9),[10](#B10)], one of which only detected the association in patients that were also *ABCB1* 2677G/T heterozygotes [[10](#B10)]. Other studies have found no association between *CYP2C8* genotype or metabolizer phenotype and paclitaxel PK [[24](#B24),[25](#B25)]. The two alleles classified as low-activity in our cohort were *CYP2C8*3* (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and *CY2C8*4* (rs1058930), with the majority of PM and IM patients carrying the *CYP2C8*3* alleles. *CYP2C8*3* genotype causes two non-synonymous changes (R139K and K399R) and has previously been characterized as diminished paclitaxel metabolic activity in multiple *in vitro* studies [[8](#B8),[11–14](#B11)]. It is believed that the effect of *CYP2C8*3* may be substrate dependent, as it is well established that *CYP2C8*3* has higher metabolic activity toward rosiglitazone [[19](#B19),[20](#B20)] and pioglitazone [[26](#B26)]. Contrary to our hypothesis that *CYP2C8*3* confers decreased activity based on the *in vitro* and limited previous *in vivo* studies, our data suggest that *CYP2C8*3* may in fact confer increased activity for paclitaxel metabolism, similar to other substrates. This further complicates interpretation of previous work from our group and others showing that *CYP2C8*3* is associated with greater risk of paclitaxel-induced PN [[10](#B10),[17](#B17),[18](#B18),[23](#B23)], however, these results have not been validated and may be false-positive findings.

*In vitro CYP2C8*4* has been shown to confer variable levels of decreased paclitaxel metabolic activity [[13](#B13),[15](#B15),[16](#B16)]. One previous clinical PK study reported decreased paclitaxel clearance [[9](#B9)], whereas others have found no association, possibly due to the small number of *CYP2C8*4* carriers [[10](#B10),[24](#B24),[25](#B25)]. Our study included only four carriers of *CYP2C8*4*, so the marginally shorter exposure was not significantly different from wild-type patients. Considering the *CYP2C8*3* and *CYP2C8*4* results together, it seems that the effect of CYP2C8 polymorphisms on human paclitaxel exposure is modest, at best.

In our analysis, patients with lower OATP1B1 activity, which is encoded by *SLCO1B1*, had longer T_c >0.05_. Low-activity *SLCO1B1* variants indirectly affect hepatic metabolism of various drugs by decreasing OATP1B1 expression at the cell membrane [[27](#B27)] and, consequently, diminishing hepatic uptake of drugs for metabolism [[28–30](#B28)]. Unlike our findings for paclitaxel, longer exposure in patients with low-activity OATP1B1 was as predicted. *In vitro* studies have suggested that *SLCO1B1* likely has modest effects on paclitaxel transport [[31](#B31),[32](#B32)], but *SLCO1B1* has not been previously examined in humans for its impact on paclitaxel PK. In the hypothesis generating screen, lower CYP2C9 activity was associated with shorter T_c >0.05_, but this association is likely due to linkage disequilibrium between the lower activity *CYP2C9*2* and *CYP2C8*3* alleles [[33](#B33)]. The association between lower UGT2B17 activity and shorter T_c >0.05_ has not been previously observed, and is likely an artifact of the number of statistically uncorrected association tests run.

Our results indicate a modest effect of *CYP2C8* and *SLCO1B1* genotypes on paclitaxel PK in humans. In a prospective clinical trial in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, randomization to utilizing T_c >0.05_-guided paclitaxel dosing reduced PN without compromising efficacy [[34](#B34)]. Initial dose recommendations in the PK-guided arm were based on BSA, age and sex; incorporating pharmacogenetics into these personalized dosing algorithms could improve their precision and enable further optimization of therapeutic outcomes.

Age has been negatively correlated with clearance in patients receiving a 1-h paclitaxel infusion [[35](#B35)], but not C_max_. However, in this study we identified a relatively large effect on C_max_, which was unexpected since age related changes in paclitaxel clearance would not be expected to affect C_max_ following the short 1-h infusions used in this cohort. Further research is needed to determine whether there is some other age-related change that explains the relatively large effect on C_max_ detected in this study. The trend for Caucasian patients to have longer T_c >0.05_ was likely due to the higher allele frequency of *CYP2C8*3* in Caucasian populations compared with Asian and African–American populations, where it is typically rare or absent [[36](#B36)]. Consistent with the trend seen in this cohort, BSA has previously been positively correlated with paclitaxel elimination in a population-PK analysis [[37](#B37)].

The primary limitation of this analysis is its modest size, which may have resulted in reduced statistical power for many of these analyses of genetic and clinical associations. Due to sparse sampling, this analysis used T_c >0.05_, a clinically relevant exposure parameter, rather than the more conventional PK parameters clearance or area under the curve (AUC) [[9](#B9),[10](#B10),[24](#B24),[25](#B25)]. However, T_c >0.05_, is predictive of PN [[2](#B2),[3](#B3)]. Consequently, determining pharmacogenomic and clinical factors that impact T_c >0.05_ has great potential to positively impact patient outcomes. T_c >0.05_ was chosen as the primary end point due to the expectation that metabolism and active transport would have minimal effect on C_max_ during a 1-h infusion, which is supported by the lack of any pharmacogenetic association in this analysis. Additionally, concomitant medications that induce or inhibit CYP2C8 or other enzymes or transporters could have impacted PK, but information on concomitant medication is not available for this cohort and could not be accounted for in this analysis.

A panel genotyping approach was selected to comprehensively investigate functionally consequential SNPs in genes relevant to drug metabolism and transport, and all genes with known or suspected functional consequence for paclitaxel metabolism or transport were included. However, enzyme activity was not measured directly, and our system for translating genotype to genetic phenotype is limited by the SNPs included on this panel and the current understanding of their functional consequence. Finally, the subjects included in this cohort were primarily Caucasian, which limits the diversity of polymorphisms and patient characteristics represented in the analysis.

## Conclusion

In this secondary analysis of female patients with breast cancer receiving weekly 1-h paclitaxel infusions, patients with low-activity CYP2C8 genetic phenotype had shorter T_c >0.05_ and patients with low-activity OATP1B1 genetic phenotype had longer T_c >0.05_. Our findings suggest that *CYP2C8*3* confers increased paclitaxel metabolism, which is contrary to prior studies but is consistent with its established functional impact on for other CYP2C8 substrates. If definitive associations between clinical and pharmacogenetic factors and paclitaxel PK are elucidated, they could potentially be incorporated into personalized dosing strategies to achieve optimal exposure levels that avoid toxicities and/or maximize treatment efficacy.

## Future perspective

Clinical, genetic and PK information will be ideally integrated in the future to personalize paclitaxel dosing regimens to reduce the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities while ensuring drug efficacy. To achieve that goal, discovery of genetic predictors of paclitaxel PK and toxicity are pivotal. Future research is needed to fully elucidate the impact of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes on paclitaxel exposure. These efforts should be integrated with on-going efforts to determine predictors of toxicity to most accurately create a paclitaxel dosing model.
