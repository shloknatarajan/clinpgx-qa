## Abstract

Aim: The association between cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene polymorphisms and anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH) was investigated in patients with or without pre-existing liver diseases (PLD).

Materials & methods: We followed 164 tuberculosis subjects, 58 with PLD and 106 without PLD. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were analyzed using the TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay.

Results: The CYP3A4*18 heterozygous genotype was associated with ATDH (OR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.06–9.86) regardless of PLD presence. Among subjects without PLD, CYP3A4*18 heterozygotes had significantly higher ATDH risk (OR: 9.10, 95% CI: 1.56–53.16). Conversely, in the PLD group, CYP3A4*18 heterozygotes had lower ATDH risk (OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05–0.98).

Conclusion: CYP3A4*18 genotype is linked to ATDH in tuberculosis patients, with differential effects based on PLD presence.

## 1. Materials & methods

### 1.1. Subjects

In this study, we consecutively surveyed a total of 164 subjects who were treated for active TB at the General Taoyuan Hospital (Taoyuan, Taiwan) between February 2011 and February 2012. The inclusion criteria were as follows: adult subjects newly diagnosed with active TB, having TB lesions evident on simple x-ray and computed tomography, and positive results of sputum smears and cultures for detection of mycobacteria.

Subjects with any of the following conditions before anti-TB treatment were defined as having pre-existing liver diseases: positive for serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen or antibody to hepatitis C virus; alcoholic liver disease or habitual alcohol drinking; any other hepatic or systemic diseases that may cause liver dysfunction; and abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or bilirubin levels.

Except for the subjects who developed severe ATDH, all subjects received oral INH 300 mg, RMP 600 mg (or 450 mg if their body weight was <50 kg), PZA 200 mg/kg body weight and EMB 800 mg daily for the first 2 months. After 2 months, PZA was discontinued, while INH, RMP and EMB were continued for an additional 4 months. ATDH was defined as an increase of serum ALT level to over two-times the upper limit of the normal value (ULN) after anti-TB treatment, according to the criteria for drug-induced liver injures developed by an international consensus meeting [[21](#CIT00021)]. Among the 58 subjects with drug-induced hepatotoxicity, 48 were re-challenged. Treatment re-challenge began with INH 50, 100, 150 and then 300 mg (the full dose of INH); followed by RMP 150, 300 and then 450 mg (the full dose for patients with a body weight of <50 kg), or 600 mg (the full dose for patients with a body weight of >50 kg). If AST, ALT and total bilirubin levels were normal during the re-challenge process, the patient received continuous INH, RMP and EMB combination therapy for 9 months [[22](#CIT00022)]. PZA co-administration-induced hepatitis was diagnosed based on negative isoniazid and rifampicin re-challenge tests. EMB is not considered to be responsible for drug-induced hepatitis [[1](#CIT00001)].

The research data were gathered from tuberculosis patients treated more than a decade ago and might not accurately represent the current scenario, particularly regarding ATDH prevalence. The definitions of ATDH and rechallenge tests have remained unchanged between then and now. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject enrolled in this study. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Taoyuan General Hospital (TYGH99040).

### 1.2. DNA preparation

Genomic DNA was extracted from oral swabs collected from enrolled subjects, using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted genomic DNA was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis, quantitatively determined by spectrophotometry and stored at -80°C until use.

### 1.3. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping

We conducted genotyping of selected functional genetic variants that have a high prevalence in the Taiwanese population, including *CYP2C9*3* (SNP ID: rs1057910), *CYP2C19*2* (SNP ID: rs4244285), *CYP2C19*3* (SNP ID: rs4986893), *CYP2D6*10* (SNP ID: rs1065852), *CYP3A4*18* (SNP ID: rs28371759) and *CYP3A5*3* (SNP ID: rs776746) [[23](#CIT00023)]. SNP genotyping was performed using the TaqMan^®^ SNP genotyping assays (ABI: Applied Biosystems, Inc, CA, USA). The primers and probes for the selected SNPs were obtained in an ABI assay on demand (AOD) kit. Reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (TaqMan^®^ SNP Genotyping Assays, protocol, Part Number 4332856 Rev. C). Probe fluorescence signal detection was performed using the ABI Prism 7900 Real-Time PCR System.

### 1.4. Statistical analysis

We used the *χ*^2^ test to analyze the associations between drug-induced hepatitis and polymorphisms. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR), with adjustment for demographic/clinical features. We used *t*-tests to make comparisons between two independent groups. All statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS 19.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

## 2. Results

### 2.1. Subjects' characteristics

For this study, we enrolled 164 subjects with TB. After anti-TB drug therapy, 58 subjects were diagnosed with ATDH. The subjects who did not experience ATDH were older than those with ATDH ([Table 1](#T0001)). The sex distribution did not significantly differ between the subjects with and without hepatotoxicity. Among the subjects with drug-induced hepatitis, there was a higher prevalence of individuals with pre-existing liver diseases prior to anti-TB drug therapy ([Table 1](#T0001)).

Table 1 Caption: Characteristics of patients with versus without drug-induced hepatitis.

Among the 58 subjects diagnosed with ATDH, 11 had serum ALT levels of two-to-three-times the ULN during anti-TB drug treatment, and continuously and uneventfully received anti-TB drugs throughout the entire anti-TB treatment phase. The remaining 47 subjects had ALT levels of >three-times the ULN, and their anti-TB drug treatment was temporarily discontinued. After temporary treatment discontinuation, these patients all exhibited normal hepatic biochemical parameters (e.g., AST, ALT and total bilirubin levels), and were re-challenged with incremental doses of INH and RMP. Among the 47 subjects re-challenged with anti-TB drugs, 12 were more susceptible to RMP hepatotoxicity, while the other 35 subjects were more susceptible to hepatotoxicity caused by PZA (or co-administration).

### 2.2. CYP3A4*18 heterozygous genotype showed a suggestive association with drug-induced hepatotoxicity

Six selected SNPs of CYP genes were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. None of the selected SNPs appeared to be significantly associated with first-line drug-induced hepatitis ([Table 2](#T0002)). We further evaluated the association between selected SNPs and PZA-induced hepatitis, and found no significant difference in these genotype frequencies ([Table 3](#T0003)). The total patient counts in [Tables 2](#T0002) and [3](#T0003) do not match those in [Table 1](#T0001) because of genotyping failures.

Table 3 Caption: Genotype frequencies of selected CYP SNPs among patients with PZA-induced hepatitis versus without drug-induced hepatitis.

We identified a marginally significant difference (*P* = 0.066) in the genotype frequency of *CYP3A4*18* (rs28371759) between TB subjects with versus without drug-induced hepatitis ([Table 2](#T0002)). Additionally, the distribution of the *CYP3A4*18* genotype exhibited a trend suggesting an association (*P* = 0.059) with PZA-induced hepatitis ([Table 3](#T0003)).

### 2.3. Multinomial logistic regression analysis to evaluation the association between CYP3A4*18 & antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity

Age and the distribution of pre-existing liver diseases (PLD) significantly differed between subjects with and without ATDH ([Table 1](#T0001)). Therefore, we further analyzed the genotyping data of CYP3A4 by multinomial logistic regression with adjustment for age or PLD. After adjustment for age, OR analysis revealed a significant association of the *CYP3A4*18* AG genotype with increased risk of ATDH (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.239, 95% CI: 1.064–9.864, p = 0.034). However, we did not observe any significant association when the OR analysis was adjusted for PLD (aOR: 1.480, 95% CI: 0.449–4.880; p = 0.520) ([Table 4](#T0004)). Age did not significantly differ between subjects with *CYP3A4*18* AA versus AG genotypes. Interestingly, among individuals with the *CYP3A4*18* AG genotype, a higher percentage had PLD ([Table 4](#T0004)).

Table 4 Caption: Evaluation of the association between CYP3A4*18 genotype and ATDH adjusted according to age or pre-existing liver disease.

Since our findings suggested that PLD was likely a confounding factor related to the *CYP3A4*18* genotype, we next categorized subjects into non-PLD and PLD groups, and re-evaluated the association between the *CYP3A4*18* genotype and ATDH. This revealed that the *CYP3A4*18* AG genotype was a risk factor for ATDH in the non-PLD group (OR: 9.1), whereas it exhibited a protective effect in the PLD group (OR: 0.214).

## 3. Discussion

Our present results indicated that the *CYP3A4*18* AG genotype was significantly associated with ATDH risk, and suggested that it may be considered a predisposing factor for ATDH development in the Taiwanese population. Additionally, the *CYP3A4*18* AG genotype was associated with an increased risk for ATDH among subjects without PLD. Interestingly, among subjects with PLD, the *CYP3A4*18* AG genotype was associated with decreased ATDH risk.

In this study, we found a significant association between *CYP3A4*18* genotype and ATDH risk ([Table 4](#T0004)), similar to previous findings that *CYP3A4*18B* genetic polymorphism is associated with an elevated risk of ATDH in the Chinese population [[24](#CIT00024),[25](#CIT00025)]. Although we did not further evaluate the effects of the *CYP3A4*18* variant on CYP3A4 enzyme activity in subjects receiving anti-TB drug therapy, previous research has indicated that *CYP3A4*18* leads to a gain of function, with higher turnover of testosterone and chlorpyrifos, in an *Escherichia coli* expression system [[26](#CIT00026)]. Moreover, clinical research among Chinese patients has shown that the *CYP3A4*18* variant is associated with increased cyclosporine and tacrolimus clearance, and CYP3A4 enzyme activity [[27](#CIT00027)]. Additionally, the *CYP3A4*18B* variant, which includes the intronic g.20230G>A variant, has also been linked to increased cyclosporine clearance and risk of developing cyclosporine-related liver injury among Chinese renal transplant patients [[28](#CIT00028),[29](#CIT00029)]. These findings may suggest that the *CYP3A4*18* variant influences the metabolism of drugs due to alterations of its enzyme activity. However, in another clinical study among 39 healthy volunteers, CYP3A4 enzymatic activity for midazolam was greatly reduced in subjects with the *CYP3A4*18* allele compared with those with the normal allele [[30](#CIT00030)]. Taken together, these findings suggest that the *CYP3A4*18* variant may have different effects on the catalytic activities between different drugs. Further research is needed to examine the association of the *CYP3A4*18* variant with *CYP3A4* gene expression and the catalytic activities of anti-TB drugs.

CYP3A4 has maintained high evolutionary conservation owing to its crucial role in the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. Rare variants in *CYP3A4* may provide insights into the underlying reasons for notable pharmacokinetic observations in clinical settings [[31](#CIT00031)]. CYP3A4 protein expression is significantly lower in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [[32](#CIT00032)] and hepatic cirrhosis [[33](#CIT00033)]. In the course of this investigation, we identified the presence of confounding factors, notably involving *CYP3A4*18* and pre-existing liver diseases. Among patients with *CYP3A4*18* allele heterozygosity, a higher percentage also had pre-existing liver diseases, compared with those with the wild-type genotype. The high evolutionary conservation of CYP3A4 may suggest that polymorphisms affecting gene function could be linked to liver dysfunction. Therefore, when studying the association between CYP genetic polymorphism and ATDH, the factor of pre-existing liver diseases should be handled with caution.

The study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size is small, and the results were underpowered (*post hoc* power: 45.9% for [Table 2](#T0002) *CYP3A4*18*/rs28371759, calculated using the website [https://clincalc.com/stats/power.aspx](https://clincalc.com/stats/power.aspx)). However, our study primarily found that *CYP3A4*18* has different effects on the hepatotoxicity of TB patients with and without pre-existing liver diseases. Secondly, due to the limited sample size, we only selected the most frequent variants of the CYP gene for testing. Variants with lower minor allele frequencies are even less likely to reach statistical significance in small sample sizes. Lastly, CYP3A4 does not appear to directly participate in the metabolism of anti-TB drugs but is influenced by them. *CYP3A4*18* is considered an ultrarapid metabolizing allele in certain drug studies, but its applicability to other drugs remains uncertain. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the relationship between CYP3A4 and ATDH, along with its biological mechanisms.

## 4. Conclusion

In summary, here we demonstrated that* CYP3A4*18* was associated with ATDH in the Taiwanese population. Notably, although the direction of this association may differ depending on whether patients have pre-existing liver diseases.
