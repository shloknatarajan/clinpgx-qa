## Abstract

**Aim:** 
To evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphisms in uridine 5′-glucuronosylytansferases UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 and iodothyronine-deiodinases types 1 and 2 on levothyroxine (T4; 3,5,3′,5′-triiodo-L-thyronine) dose requirement for suppression of thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

**Methods:** 
Patients (n = 268) submitted to total thyroidectomy and ablation by 131I, under T4 therapy for at least 6 months were recruited in three public institutions in Brazil. Multivariate regression modelling was applied to assess the association of T4 dosing with polymorphisms in UGT1A1 (rs8175347), UGT1A3 (rs3806596 and rs1983023), DIO1 (rs11206244 and rs2235544) and DIO2 (rs225014 and rs12885300), demographic and clinical variables.

**Results:** 
A regression model including UGT1A haplotypes, age, gender, body weight and serum TSH concentration accounted for 39% of the inter-individual variation in the T4 dosage. The association of T4 dose with UGT1A haplotype is attributed to reduced UGT1A1 expression and T4 glucuronidation in liver of carriers of low expression UGT1A1 rs8175347 alleles. The DIO1 and DIO2 genotypes had no influence of T4 dosage.

**Conclusion:** 
UGT1A haplotypes associate with T4 dosage in DTC patients, but the effect accounts for only 2% of the total variability and recommendation of pre-emptive UGT1A genotyping is not warranted.

### Aim

To evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphisms in uridine 5′-glucuronosylytansferases UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 and iodothyronine-deiodinases types 1 and 2 on levothyroxine (T_4_; 3,5,3′,5′-triiodo-L-thyronine) dose requirement for suppression of thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

### Methods

Patients (*n* = 268) submitted to total thyroidectomy and ablation by ^131^I, under T_4_ therapy for at least 6 months were recruited in three public institutions in Brazil. Multivariate regression modelling was applied to assess the association of T_4_ dosing with polymorphisms in *UGT1A1* (rs8175347), *UGT1A3* (rs3806596 and rs1983023), *DIO1* (rs11206244 and rs2235544) and *DIO2* (rs225014 and rs12885300), demographic and clinical variables.

### Results

A regression model including *UGT1A* haplotypes, age, gender, body weight and serum TSH concentration accounted for 39% of the inter-individual variation in the T_4_ dosage. The association of T_4_ dose with *UGT1A* haplotype is attributed to reduced UGT1A1 expression and T_4_ glucuronidation in liver of carriers of low expression *UGT1A1* rs8175347 alleles. The *DIO1* and *DIO2* genotypes had no influence of T_4_ dosage.

### Conclusion

*UGT1A* haplotypes associate with T_4_ dosage in DTC patients, but the effect accounts for only 2% of the total variability and recommendation of pre-emptive UGT1A genotyping is not warranted.

## Introduction

Thyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine cancer, occurring in about 5–10% of patients with a thyroid nodule. Thyroid cancers can be classified according to their histopathological characteristics, and the most common variants, namely papillary and follicular tumours, are grouped as differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Guidelines for the treatment of intermediate or high risk DTC recommend total thyroidectomy and ablation by ^131^I followed by long term levothyroxine (T_4_, 3,5,3′,5′-triiodo-L-thyronine) suppression of thyrotropin (TSH), as the standard of care [[1](#b1),[2](#b2)]. To exert its inhibitory control of TSH secretion, T_4_ must be converted into T_3_ (3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine) via outer (5′)-ring deionidation, catalyzed by iodothyronine-deiodinases types 1 (D1) and 2 (D2). Type 3 iodothyronine deionidase (D3), and to a lesser extent, D1 catalyze the inner (5)-ring deiodination of T_3_ and T_4_ into reverse T_3_ (rT_3_) and T_2,_ respectively, thus inactivating the thyroid hormone action (Figure [1](#fig01)). D1 is mainly involved in serum T_3_ production whereas D2 controls the local conversion of T_4_ into T_3_ in the hypothalamus and pituitary, and thereby plays a pivotal role in the negative feedback regulation of TSH secretion [[3](#b3)–[5](#b5)]. In humans, D1 and D2 are encoded by the *DIO1* and *DIO2* genes, which map to chromosomes 1p33-p32 and 14q24.2, respectively.

In addition to deiodination, T_4_ is metabolized in human liver by UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGTs) and readily excreted into bile as thyroxine glucuronide. Kinetic experiments using recombinant UGT isoforms and liver microsomes revealed that T_4_ glucuronidation in humans is mediated by UGT1A subfamily enzymes, especially UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 [[6](#b6)–[10](#b10)]. The respective encoding genes, *UGT1A1* and *UGT1A3,* map to chromosome 2q37 and harbour several functional polymorphisms. We reported recently that a common polymorphism in *UGT1A1*, consisting of a variable dinucleotide repeat within the promoter TATA element (*UGT1A1 −*53(TA)_n_, rs8175347) was associated with the T_4_ dose required for TSH suppression in a cohort of Brazilian DTC patients [[11](#b11)]. A significant trend for decreasing T_4_ dose with increasing number of copies of the low expression (TA)_7_ and (TA)_8_ alleles was observed, and ascribed to reduced T_4_ glucuronidation in patients harbouring these variant alleles [[12](#b12)]. However, the relatively small difference in T_4_ doses across the *UGT1A1 −*53(TA)_n_ groups and considerable overlap of doses among groups, prompted us to suggest that the association between T_4_ dose and *UGT1A1 −*53(TA)_n_ genotype should be tested in a larger cohort and extended to polymorphisms in other UGT isoforms involved in T_4_ glucuronidation in human liver. Accordingly, we recruited 170 additional DTC patients from a different institution and extended our analyses to two common polymorphisms in *UGT1A3* (rs3806596, −66T>C and rs1983023, −751T>C), which are major determinants of *UGT1A3* haplotypes that impact on the expression of UGT1A3 and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the UGT1A3 preferential substrate, atorvastatin [[13](#b13),[14](#b14)]. We also examined the influence of polymorphisms in *DIO1* (rs11206244, 785C>T, previously D1a-C/T; rs2235544, −34C>A) and *DIO2* (rs225014, 274A>G, previously Thr92Ala; rs12885300, −451C>T, previously ORFa-Gly3Asp), which have been associated with circulating concentrations of T_3_ and T_4_ and/or TSH, with controversial results [[15](#b15)–[20](#b20)].

## Methods

### Study cohort and experimental protocol

DTC patients (*n* = 268) who had been submitted to total thyroidectomy and ablation by ^131^I and were under T_4_ therapy for at least 6 months were recruited in three institutions of the Brazilian Public Health System. Two of these are located in Rio de Janeiro (Instituto Nacional de Câncer and the Instituto Estadual de Diabetes e Endocrinologia Luiz Capriglione, *n* = 98 patients) and the third in São Paulo (A C Camargo Cancer Center, *n* = 170). The patients from Rio de Janeiro were enrolled in our previous study of the association between the *UGT1A1-*53(TA)_n_ polymorphism and T_4_ dose [[11](#b11)]. The experimental protocol of the current study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the three institutions, patients signed an informed consent form to participate and self-identified with one of the official ‘race/colour’ categories adopted by the Brazilian Census, namely *branco* (meaning White, *n* = 124), *pardo* (Brown, *n* = 123), *preto* (Black, *n* = 4), *amarelo* (Yellow, referring to Asian ancestry, *n* = 7) and undefined (*n* = 10). These colour categories are capitalized to highlight their meaning in the context of the Brazil Census. Because of their small number, Black patients were combined with Brown patients for statistical analysis. Exclusion criteria included poor compliance with T_4_ therapy (assessed by counting the T_4_ tablets, which were provided free of cost to patients), clinically relevant liver or kidney disease, alcoholism or co-medication with UGT1A1 inducers (anticonvulsants, barbiturates and rifampicin), or any drug that could interfere with TSH secretion (amiodarone, high doses of glucocorticoids, octreotide or bexaterotene) and/or affect T_4_ gastrointestinal absorption (bile acid binding resins, proton pump inhibitors or calcium carbonate). T_4_ was provided as Puran T4® (Sanofi-Aventis Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) or Synthroid® (Abbott Laboratórios do Brasil Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil), in 25 to 200 μg tablets. Daily doses were adjusted individually to the required level of TSH suppression, determined by risk stratification, according to Tuttle *et al*. [[21](#b21)]. For high and intermediate risk patients, serum TSH was kept <0.1 mU l^−1^, whereas the range of 0.1−0.5 mU l^−1^ was considered appropriate for low risk patients [[1](#b1),[2](#b2)]. Free T_4_ and TSH concentrations in serum were measured by chemoluminescence (ADVIA® Centaur® XP Immunoassay System, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Dublin, Ireland).

### Genotyping

Standard protocols were used for extraction of genomic DNA from peripheral lymphocytes. The *UGT1A1-*53(TA)_n_ polymorphism (rs8175347) was assessed by direct sequencing, using the ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), as described previously [[11](#b11)]. Taqman assays were used for allele discrimination of the *DIO1* rs2235544 (probe C_15952583_10), *DIO1* rs11206244 (C_334342_20), *DIO2* rs225014 (C_15819951_10), *DIO2* rs12885300 (C_31755153_30), *UGT1A3* rs1983023 (C_11473200_10) and *UGT1A3* rs3806596 (custom probe AH89MI5) SNPs, using the Fast 7500 Real-Time System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Allele and genotype frequency were derived by gene counting. Deviations from Hardy−Weinberg equilibrium were assessed by the goodness-of-fit χ^2^ test. The χ^2^ test was used for comparison of allele and genotype frequencies. A *P* value ≤0.05 was considered significant.

### Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analyses

Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses of polymorphisms in *UGT1A*, *DIO1* and *DIO2* genes were conducted online using the CUBEX software [[22](#b22)]. The level of LD between loci was assessed using the coefficients *D'* and *r2*. *UGT1A* haplotypes, comprising *UGT1A1* rs8175347, *UGT1A3* rs3806596 and *UGT1A3* rs1983023, were statistically inferred using the haplo-stats software, version 1.3 [[23](#b23)]. This software attributes a posterior probability value for the diplotype configuration for each individual based on estimated haplotype frequencies. The minimal posterior probability value for inclusion of an individual in the present analyses was set at 0.91, which allowed the inclusion of 253 individuals (94.4% of the overall cohort). Haplotypes are labelled by numbers preceded by ‘Br’ (e.g. HapBr1), a reference to this Brazilian cohort.

### Multivariate regression model

To select candidate variables for multiple regression modelling of T_4_ dosing, we initially examined the independent effects of age, gender, colour, weight, serum T_4_ and TSH levels, *DIO1* and *DIO2* genotypes and number of copies (zero, one or two) of *UGT1A* wild-type haplotype, designated HapBr1. Genetic variables were analyzed according to either codominant or recessive models. In the latter, carriers of one or two copies of the wild-type allele at the *DIO1* and *DIO2* SNPs and carriers of one or two copies of the *UGT1A* HapBr1 were contrasted with the respective homozygotes for the variant *DIO* alleles and non-carriers of *UGT1A* HapBr1. Discrete covariates entered the analysis transformed as dummy variables to quantify how the individual categories affected T_4_ daily dose. The effects of discrete variables were described by electing a baseline category and comparing the transformed response predicted at this category with the remaining category or categories of interest. Variables that associated (*P* < 0.15) with T_4_ dose in the univariate analyses were considered further in multivariate regression models. Variables that associated (*P* < 0.05) with T_4_ dose in successive multivariate analyses were included in the final model. We assessed the goodness of fit of our models based on the statistics *r2* and *r2* adjusted. The former is a measure of how well the regression line approximates the observed data points. It can also be interpreted as the proportion of the total variance in the observed data that is explained by the model. Since *r2* always increases with the number of variables in the model, this measure can be accounted for by adjusting for the number of covariates in the model, yielding the statistics known as the adjusted *r2.* The relative contribution of each variable in the final regression was estimated by the partial *r2* statistics, which measures the degree of association between two random variables, with the effect of a set of controlling random variables removed.

## Results

Table [1](#tbl1) summarizes the demographics of the 268 subjects included in the study. Women accounted for 82.5% of the cohort, median age was 46 (interquartile range 37–56) years and most patients (92%) self-identified as White (46.2%) or Brown (45.9%). All self-reported Yellow patients referred to Japanese ancestry. The distribution of the White, Brown plus Black and Yellow patients in the study cohort did not differ significantly (*P* = 0.12, χ^2^ test) from the corresponding proportions in the present day population of Southeast Brazil [[24](#b24)].

### Allele frequency, genotype distribution, linkage disequilibrium and UGT1A haplotypes

Table [2](#tbl2) shows the allele frequency and genotype distribution of the *UGT1A1, UGT1A3, DIO1* and *DIO2* polymorphisms in the overall cohort. Deviations from Hardy−Weinberg expectations were not observed (*P =* 0.33−0.79 for the different loci). The three polymorphisms in the *UGT1A* genes were in strong LD, with pairwise *D'* values >0.97 and *r2*s of 0.56 (rs8175347*28 and rs3806596 allele T), 0.72 (rs8175347*28 and rs1983023 allele T) and 0.77 (rs3806596 allele T and rs1983023 allele T). The previously reported [[17](#b17)] extensive LD between rs1120622T and rs2235544A in *DIO1* was confirmed in the study cohort (D' = 1.0, *r2* = 0.53), whereas no LD (*r2* = 0.18) was detected between the rs12885300 and rs225014 SNPs in *DIO2.* Diplotype analysis of *UGT1A* loci generated eight haplotypes, of which four had frequencies greater than 1% and together accounted for 98.6% of the overall genetic diversity (Table [3](#tbl3)). Haplotypes comprising either the wild-type alleles (HapBr1, frequency 0.516) or the variant alleles at the three loci (HapBr2, 0.350) represented nearly 90% of all haplotypes. The number of patients carrying two, one or no copies of the wildtype HapBr1 haplotype were 64, 134 and 55, respectively.

Allele frequency data according to self-reported colour are presented in Supplementary Table [1](#tbl1). The only significant deviation from Hardy−Weinberg expectations (*P* = 0.03) occurred in *DIO2* rs12885300 in the Brown and Black group, which showed an excess of heterozygous patients. No significant differences were detected in allele frequency between White *vs.* Brown plus Black patients. The small number (*n* = 8) of patients of Japanese descent precluded statistical analyses of their data, but we will mention that the variant *UGT1A3* rs1983023T allele was not detected in this group, in contrast with its high frequency in White (0.54) and Brown plus Black patients (0.58).

### Regression modelling of T4 dosing

The initial univariate analyses disclosed gender, age, weight, serum T_4_, serum TSH and the number of copies of the *UGTA1* HapBr1 haplotype as being associated (*P* < 0.15) with T_4_ dose (Table [4](#tbl4)). No association was observed between T_4_ dose and *DIO1* or *DIO2* SNPs. In the codominant genetic model, association of T_4_ dose with *UGTA1* was restricted to carriers of zero copies of the HapBr1 haplotype, which is consistent with the results observed under the recessive model (Table [4](#tbl4)). Accordingly, the *UGT1A* haplotype was entered as a recessive trait into multivariate regression modelling, alongside gender, age, weight, serum T_4_ and serum TSH. The covariates associated (*P* < 0.05) with T_4_ daily dose in the final multivariate regression model are listed in Table [4](#tbl4) with their respective regression coefficients and contribution to the model, as measured by the partial *r2* statistics. The T_4_ daily dose requirement increased with increasing weight, decreased with ageing, was inversely associated with the serum TSH concentration, was greater in men than women and was lower in non-carriers of the *UGT1A* HapBr1 haplotype. The partial *r2* statistics showed that weight had the largest influence on T_4_ dose requirement (*r2* = 0.134), followed by age (0.068), gender (0.037), the *UGT1A* HapBr1 (0.020) and serum TSH (0.013). Based on the adjusted *r2* value, the final regression model explained 38.8% of the overall variability in T_4_ daily dose required for TSH suppression in the study cohort.

Prompted by the results reported by Tortolano *et al*. [[19](#b19)] we examined the association between *DIO2* rs225014 and T4 dosage in DTC patients with TSH concentrations in the range of 0.1−0.5 mU l^−1^, using the recessive genetic model, and obtained a *P* value 0.63 in the univariate analysis.

## Discussion

This is, to our knowledge, the first study of the combined influence of genetic polymorphisms affecting the two principal metabolic pathways of T_4_, namely glucuronidation and deiodination, on the T_4_ dose required for TSH suppression in DTC patients. Our study encompassed UGT1A1 and UGT1A3, which play a dominant role in T_4_ glucuronidation in liver [[6](#b6)–[10](#b10)] and D1 and D2, which play a vital role in the conversion of the prohormone T_4_, into T_3_, the active thyroid hormone [[3](#b3)–[5](#b5)]. A two-step (univariate followed by multivariate) regression modelling including polymorphisms in the respective encoding genes, in addition to demographic and clinical covariates was applied to data from a patient cohort recruited in public institutions from the two most populated cities in Brazil. The final regression model, which included weight, age, gender, serum TSH concentration and zero copies of the *UGT1A* HapBr1 (wild-type) haplotype accounted for 39% of the inter-individual variation in the T_4_ dose required for TSH suppression. The inclusion of weight, age and gender in the model is consistent with long standing knowledge that these variables are major determinants of T_4_ dosage in the treatment of thyroid diseases [[25](#b25)–[27](#b27)]. Accordingly, the T_4_ dose in DTC patients decreased with advancing age, increased with increasing body weight and was greater in men than women. The retention of gender as an independent covariate in the final model suggests that gender-related differences in body weight cannot entirely account for the higher T_4_ dose requirement in males, but does not exclude the possible influence of differences in body composition, among others, between males and females [[28](#b28)]. The inverse correlation of serum TSH concentration and T_4_ dosage is consistent with the therapeutic goal of T_4_-induced TSH suppression in DTC patients.

Among the genetic polymorphisms investigated, only the inferred *UGT1A1* haplotypes comprising *UGT1A1* rs8175347, *UGT1A3* rs3806596 and *UGT1A3* rs1983023 were included in the final multivariate model for T_4_ dose requirement. These SNPs were in tight LD with pairwise *D'* = 1 and *r2* coefficients ranging from 0.56 to 0.77 and two haplotypes, including either the wildtype (HapBr1) or the variant alleles (HapBr2) at the three loci, accounted for 90% of the genetic diversity in the cohort. The multivariate regression modelling showed that non-carriers of *UGT1A* HapBr1 require significantly lower T_4_ doses compared with carriers of one or two copies of this haplotype, but no difference between the latter two groups of patients. Non-carriers of the *UGT1A* HapBr1 harbour the (TA)_7_ and/or (TA)_8_ alleles at *UGT1A1* rs8175347, and their lower T_4_ dose requirement is consistent with our previous observation of a trend for decreasing T_4_ dose with increasing number of copies of these low expression *UGT1A1* alleles [[11](#b11)]. Reduced T_4_ glucuronidation in the liver of patients with low expression *UGT1A1* alleles was thought to account for our previous findings and is also likely to account for the present results. However, the most common low expression *UGT1A1 −*53(TA)_7_ allele (*UGT1A1*28*) was tightly linked to the *UGT1A3* rs3806596C and rs1983023C variant alleles in non-carriers of the HapBr1 haplotype. These two variant alleles are major markers of the *UGT1A3*2* haplotype, which has been linked to higher expression of UGT1A3 and shown to impact on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the UGT1A3 preferential substrate, atorvastatin [[13](#b13),[14](#b14)]. Although inference of the *UGT1A3*2* haplotype requires identification of alleles at other loci, which were not genotyped in our patients, it is reasonable to speculate that carriers of U*GT1A3* CC diplotype (HapBr2) would have substantially increased expression of UGT1A3 mRNA and protein, and greater UGT1A3 catalytic activity in liver microsomes, compared with carriers of the TT diplotypes (HapBr1).

Because of the opposite effects of *UGT1A1*28* [(TA)_7_] and admittedly the linked *UGT1A3* rs3806596C and rs1983023C alleles on the expression and activity of UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 in human liver, respectively [[13](#b13),[14](#b14)], we suggest that the extent of UGT1A-mediated glucuronidation will be substrate-dependent, according to the relative contribution of each isoform. The reduced T_4_ dose requirement for TSH suppression in non-carriers of UGT1A HapBr1 in the present study*,* suggests a predominant role of UGT1A1 in T_4_ glucuronidation in human liver, which is consistent with *in vitro* data [[6](#b6)–[10](#b10)]. UGT1A1 is also the major isoform in the glucuronidation of SN-38, the active metabolite of the chemotherapeutic agent, irinotecan, and *UGT1A1* polymorphisms have been shown to associate with SN-38 disposition and toxicity [[29](#b29)]. In contrast to thyroxine and irinotecan, UGT1A3 plays a predominant role in the conversion of atorvastatin into the pharmacologically inactive lactone metabolite, which is enhanced in carriers of the linked *UGT1A3*2* and *UGT1A1*28* alleles, leading to reduced lipid-lowering effects of atorvastatin [[14](#b14),[15](#b15)]. UGT-mediated glucuronidation is a major drug metabolizing reaction in humans, and the relative contribution of different enzyme isoforms varies considerably among substrates. Thus, extrapolation of the findings of the present study regarding thyroxine disposition and dosage to other UGT1A substrates, is unwarranted.

The T_4_ dosage in the Brazilian DCT patients showed no significant association with polymorphisms in genes encoding the D1 and D2 enzymes, namely rs11206244 and rs2235544 in *DIO1* and rs225014 and rs12885300 in *DIO2.* D1 and D2 are predominantly activating enzymes, both converting the pro-hormone T_4_ into T_3_ by outer (5′)-ring deiodination. D1, however, has a remarkable preference for reverse T_3_ (rT_3_) as substrate, which argues for its role as a scavenger of deiodinate inactive iodothyronines (reviewed in [[3](#b3)]). The tightly linked rs11206244T and rs2235544A alleles have been associated with lower enzymatic activity, relative to their ancestral counterparts, rs11206244C and rs2235544C, respectively [[18](#b18),[30](#b30)]. Accordingly, carriers of the variant rs11206244T and rs2235544A alleles show reduced serum concentrations of free T_3_ and higher concentrations of free T_4_ and free rT_3_, resulting in lower T_3_ : T_4_ and T_3_ : rT_3_ ratios and a higher rT_3_ : T_4_ ratio, but no effect no serum TSH concentration [[18](#b18),[31](#b31)]. Furthermore, a study in DTC patients under chronic T_4_ treatment detected no influence of *DIO1* rs11206244 on the set point of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis [[19](#b19)]. The latter observation is consistent with the lack of association between this polymorphism (and the linked rs2235544 SNP) and T_4_ dosage in our study cohort. Of note, this result was verified using either the codominant or the recessive genetic model for the regression analyses.

We observed no association between *DIO2* rs225014 or rs12885300 polymorphisms on T_4_ dose requirement for TSH suppression in DTC patients, whether adopting codominant or recessive genetic models. In the case of rs225014, this is consistent with previous results in patients with DTC or Hashimoto thyroiditis [[18](#b18)–[20](#b20)]. By contrast, Torlontano *et al*. [[19](#b19)]. reported that DTC patients, homozygous for rs225014C, needed a higher T_4_ dose compared with carriers of the wild-type rs225014T allele. The latter observation applied only to patients with serum TSH concentrations in the range of 0.1−0.5 mU l^−1^ (‘near-suppressed’ group) but not in the ‘suppressed group’ (TSH <0.1 mU l^−1^). However, regression analyses of the near-suppressed group in our cohort, using a recessive genetic model, did not verify these findings. Possible reasons for the discordant results of Torlonano *et al*. [[19](#b19)] were discussed by Heemstra *et al*. [[20](#b20)], and the balance of evidence is consistent with the lack of significant association between *DIO2* rs225014 and T_4_ dosage in DTC patients.

The other *DIO2* SNP examined in our study, rs12885300C>T, has shown inconsistent effects in previous studies *in vitro* [[32](#b32),[33](#b33)] and *in vivo* [[1](#b1),[17](#b17),[18](#b18)]. In patients on T_4_ treatment, Panicker *et al*. [[17](#b17)]. observed no correlation between this SNP and circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones, whereas a weaker negative feedback of free T_4_ on TSH in DTC patients homozygous for the variant rs12885300T, compared with carriers of the wild-type allele, was reported by Hoftijzer *et al*. [[18](#b18)]. These authors, however, were uncertain as to the clinical significance of this finding. Accordingly, in our DTC patients, no association between the rs12885300C>T genotype and T_4_ dosage was observed.

In conclusion, we investigated the association of clinical, demographical and genetic variables with T_4_ dose required for TSH suppression in Brazilian patients with DTC. Multivariate regression analyses confirmed significant associations of T_4_ dosage with weight, age, gender, serum TSH concentration and linked polymorphisms in *UGT1A3* and *UGT1A1* genes. A regression model comprising these covariates explained 39% on the inter-individual dose variability in the study cohort. Polymorphisms in *DIO1* and *DIO2* had no effect on T_4_ dose requirement for TSH suppression.
