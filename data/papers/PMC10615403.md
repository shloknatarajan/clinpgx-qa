## Abstract

To investigate associations between inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) gene polymorphisms and long-term outcomes among chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients in Northeast China treated with Peg-interferon (IFN)/ribavirin (RBV). CHC patients who received Peg-IFN-2a/RBV treatment during between 2011 and 2013 at 5 hepatitis centers in Northeast China were enrolled. ITPA single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1127354 and rs7270101 from all patients were detected and their associations with 5-year outcomes were analyzed. A total of 635 patients, including 421 infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and 214 infected with non-genotype 1 were included. No significant differences were observed in the distribution frequencies of ITPA rs1127354 variants and ITPase activity between patients with HCV genotype 1 and non-genotype 1. In patients who received more than 80% of the planned RBV dose, the 5-year virological response rate and the improvement in liver fibrosis were higher in those with ITPA rs1127354 non-CC with ITPase activity <25% compared with these outcomes in patients with ITPA rs1127354 CC with 100% ITPase activity. Multiple regression analysis revealed that HCV genotype non-1, low baseline HCV ribose nucleic acid (RNA) levels (≤4 × 105 IU/mL), interleukin-28B rs12979860 CC genotype, low baseline liver fibrosis (Fibroscan 0-2), and ITPA rs1127354 non-CC genotype were independent predictors for a high long-term virological response rate, whereas interleukin-28B rs12979860 CC genotype, ITPA rs1127354 non-CC genotype, and low baseline liver fibrosis were independent predictors for improvement of liver fibrosis. ITPA rs1127354 polymorphisms is predictors of long-term outcomes in CHC patients treated with Peg-IFN/RBV.

## 1. Introduction

The inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) gene encodes an inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPase), which specifically recognizes and catalyzes the pyrophosphohydrolysis of inosine triphosphate, to maintain the purity of nucleoside triphosphate in cells.^[1]^

Recently, many studies have indicated that 2 ITPA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1127354 and rs7270101, are associated with ribavirin (RBV)-induced anemia in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with RBV-based antiviral therapy.^[2–5]^ ITPA rs1127354 (P32T) is located in the exon of the gene on chromosome 2, while rs7270101 (IVS2) is located in the intron of the gene on chromosome 2.^[6]^ Several clinical studies have confirmed that *ITPA* polymorphisms can affect the dosage of RBV used, thus affecting the antiviral efficacy of Peg-IFN/RBV indirectly.^[6–9]^ Moreover, *ITPA* polymorphisms can even affect the antiviral efficacy of RBV combined with direct antiviral agents (DAAs).^[10,11]^ One study suggested that in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2/3, ITPA rs1127354 and rs7270101 can affect the antiviral efficacy directly, independently of the RBV dose.^[12]^ However, no studies have investigated associations between ITPA SNPs and long-term antiviral efficacy as well as long-term prognosis in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, regardless of RBV dose.

Because the direct impact of *ITPA* polymorphisms on antiviral efficacy in CHC patients is controversial, studies with large samples from different regions worldwide are needed to investigate whether *ITPA* polymorphisms indirectly affect the antiviral efficacy by increasing the incidence of RBV-induced anemia or whether they directly affect the antiviral efficacy and prognosis. Moreover, with the widespread application of DAAs in the treatment of HCV infection, researchers have paid much attention to the association between the antiviral efficacy of DAAs and the long-term prognosis of CHC patients.^[13–17]^ In addition, in 2016, high incidence and recurrence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were reported in patients receiving treatment with DAAs.^[13]^ The long-term virological response and prognosis, including the improvement in liver fibrosis and the incidence of HCC, with different anti-HCV therapies should be reviewed to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different therapies. Thus, individual precise treatment can be achieved by considering both the genetic background and the advantages of different therapies.

The present study aimed to investigate: (1) any associations between the ITPases encoded by different ITPA polymorphisms and the incidence of RBV-induced anemia as well as the long-term virological response independent of RBV dose, and (2) any associations between *ITPA* polymorphisms and improvement in liver fibrosis and the incidence of HCC 5 years posttreatment.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Patients

This was a follow-up study of our previous report.^[18]^ Patients diagnosed with CHC between January 2011 and January 2013 at 5 regional representative hepatitis centers (China–Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, the People’s Hospital of Jilin City, the Fourth Hospital affiliated to Harbin Medical University, the People’s Hospital of Hunchun, and the Second Hospital of Daqing) in the Northeast China were enrolled. All patients received Peg-IFN/RBV treatment. Patients who received 80% of the planned Peg-IFN/RBV dose were followed up for 5 years. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of China-Japan Union Hospital affiliated to Jilin University and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR-ONRC-12002207).

The inclusion criteria were: anti-HCV and HCV ribose nucleic acid (RNA) positive, as quantified with the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/TaqMan 48 with a lower limit of detection of 15 IU/mL before treatment; diagnosis of CHC and eligible for the Peg-IFN/RBV treatment according to the EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines for management of HCV infection.^[19]^

The exclusion criteria were: receiving or had been receiving IFN/RBV treatment; and comorbidities including Child-Pugh C decompensated liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus, alcoholic liver disease, drug-induced liver disease, or autoimmune liver disease.

### 2.2. SNP genotyping

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. The quantity of the extracted genomic DNA was determined on ultraviolet spectroscopy (NanoDrop model ND-1000 Peqlab Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany) using the absorbance ratio of 260 nm/280 nm. The primers used were:

ITPA rs1127354:

Forward: 5′-AGGAGATGGGCAGCAGAGT-3′

Backward: 5′-GCTCAACAAACTGTGTCTACTCTATT-3′

ITPA rs7270101:

Forward: 5′-TTGGTGGCACAGAAAATTGAC-3′

Backward: 5′-GGGAAACAGACACACAGAAAGTCA-3′

Interleukin-28B (IL-28B) rs12979860:

Forward: 5′-CCTCTGCACAGTCTGGGATTC-3′

Backward: 5′-GCTCAGGGTCAATCACAGAAG-3′

#### 2.2.1. HCV genotyping.

HCV genotyping was achieved using a commercial kit (SinoMDgene, Beijing, China) based on polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing.

#### 2.2.2. Grading of ITPase activity.

ITPase activity was graded according to a previously described method.^[3–5]^

### 2.3. Therapy

Individual therapy was performed according to HCV genotype and virological response during treatment based on the standard regimen of PEG-IFN-2α (subcutaneous injection, 180 μg/w) and RBV (1000 mg/d for genotype 1 and 800 mg/d for non-genotype 1) according to the 2011 EASL HCV Guidelines.^[19]^ The treatment course was 24 weeks for patients with HCV genotype 1 who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR) and had a low baseline viral load (HCV RNA < 400,000 IU/mL), 48 weeks for patient who achieved a complete early virological response (cEVR), and 72 weeks for those without cEVR. The treatment course was 12 weeks for patients with HCV non-genotype 1 who achieved a RVR without low response risk factors (e.g., insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, and advanced age), 24 weeks for those with low response risk factors, and 48 weeks for those without cEVR. The treatment was stopped when the patient only achieved a partial response or null response.

During treatment, PEG-IFN was decreased to a half of the routine dose if the neutrophil granulocyte count was <0.75 × 10^9^/L or the platelet count was less than 50 × 10^9^/L. The treatment was stopped if the neutrophil granulocyte count was <0.5 × 10^9^/L or the platelet count was <25 × 10^9^/L.^[19]^ If the hemoglobin level decreased to 10 g/dL, the RBV was decreased to 600 mg/d; if the hemoglobin level decreased to 8 g/dL, the RBV was further decreased to a minimum of 200 mg/d. No erythrogenin or other therapy for anemia was applied during treatment. Patients who received more than 80% of the planned RBV dose were included in the final analysis and followed up for 5 years or longer.

RVR was defined by an undetectable HCV RNA level at week 4 posttreatment; cEVR was defined by an undetectable HCV RNA level at week 12 posttreatment; partial response was defined by a decrease in HCV RNA by more than 2Log at week 12 posttreatment compared to the baseline and by detection of HCV RNA at weeks 12 and 24 posttreatment; sustained virological response (SVR) was defined by an undetectable level of HCV RNA at week 24 after the end of the treatment; and NR was defined by a decrease in HCV RNA by <2Log at week 12 posttreatment compared to the baseline.

### 2.4. Monitoring of parameters and methods

CHC patients were routinely monitored with analysis of the blood, urine, serum biochemical indexes, thyroid function, alpha-fetoprotein, interleukin (IL)-28B rs12979860 genotyping, HCV RNA levels, and liver fibrosis staging (FibroScan, Echosens, France) before treatment.

Liver fibrosis staging was presented as the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) detected by FibroScan: F0–F1, LSM < 7.3 kPa; F2, LSM ≥ 7.3 kPa; F3, LSM ≥ 9.3 kPa; and F4, LSM ≥ 14.6 kPa. Liver steatosis was evaluated by the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP, dB/m).

In the first 12 weeks post therapy, routine blood examination, serum biochemical indexes, and HCV RNA levels were detected every 4 weeks. Later, these parameters were detected every 12 weeks until 24 weeks after the end of therapy. HCV RNA levels and liver stiffness were detected every year after the end of therapy.

### 2.5. Statistical analysis

Continuous data were analyzed using univariate analysis and Student *t*-test. The category data were analyzed using Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis. The sample size was determined as 10 events per variable included in the logistic regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 (Chicago, IL).

#### 3.1.3. Associations between ITPA rs1127354 SNPs and long-term virological response.

During the first 4 weeks of treatment, the incidence of anemia was higher in patients with *ITPA* rs1127354 CC than in those with non-CC regardless of HCV genotype (Fig. [1](#F1)A). The percentage of patients who completed 80% of the planned RBV dose was higher in the non-CC subgroup than in the CC subgroup regardless of HCV genotype (Fig. [1](#F1)B). Further analysis in 442 patients who completed 80% of the planned RBV dose and were followed up for 5 years indicated that patients with *ITPA* rs1127354 non-CC showed a higher virological response rate than those with CC at 24 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years after the end of treatment (Fig. [2](#F2)).

### 3.2. Factors affecting the 5-year SVR

Univariate analysis indicated that patients with liver fibrosis F0-2, HCV non-genotype 1, a baseline HCV RNA level less than 4 × 10^5^ IU/mL, IL-28B rs12979860 genotype CC, or liver steatosis with a CAP <238 had a greater chance of achieving long-term SVR. Further multivariate analysis showed that liver fibrosis F0-2, HCV non-genotype 1, a baseline HCV RNA level less than 4 × 10^5^ IU/mL, IL-28B rs12979860 genotype CC, and ITPA rs1127354 genotype non-CC were independent predictors for a long SVR (Table [4](#T4)).

### 3.3. Factors affecting the 5-year improvement in liver fibrosis

Univariate analysis indicated that IL-28B rs12979860 genotype non-CC, *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype CC, or high baseline liver fibrosis F3-4 were predictors of poor improvement. Further multivariate analysis showed that IL-28B rs12979860 genotype non-CC, *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype CC, and high baseline liver fibrosis of F3-4 were independent predictors for poor improvement in liver fibrosis (Table [5](#T5)).

## 4. Discussion

In the present study, *ITPA* rs1127354 variants without a difference in HCV genotype were found in Chinese patients infected with HCV. HCV genotype non-1, a low baseline HCV RNA level, IL-28B rs12979860 CC polymorphism, low baseline liver fibrosis (Fibroscan 1-2), and *ITPA* rs1127354 CC were independent predictors of a high long-term virological response rate and improvement in liver fibrosis.

Although DAAs have been widely applied in anti-HCV treatment, a Peg-IFN/RBV regimen is still recommended in the HCV management guidelines from the WHO, EASL and other countries including China. Moreover, RBV is recommended for combined use with some DAAs, and Peg-IFN has been recommended for combined use with protease inhibitors.^[20]^ Two studies have demonstrated the efficacy of DAA in combination with Peg-IFN/RBV in real-world settings.^[21,22]^ In addition, the prognosis difference between the 2 anti-HCV regimens needs to be further studied. Thus, it is important to study the 5-year prognosis for the Peg-IFN/RBV regimen as well as the associations between *ITPA* SNPs and patients’ long-term prognosis.

IL-28B gene polymorphism has been reported to be associated with staging of liver disease in chronic HCV patients.^[23]^ Here, we also found that the IL-28B rs12979860 CC polymorphism was an independent predictor of a high long-term virological response rate and improvement in liver fibrosis, suggesting its possible role in precise treatment of HCV infection.

*ITPA* SNPs have been shown to be related to the activity of the encoded protein ITPase.^[3–5]^ *ITPA* SNPs affect the metabolism of some purine drugs such as 6-dithiopurine and azathioprine.^[2]^ Recently, it was found that *ITPA* SNPs affect the metabolism of RBV and are associated with RBV-induced hemolytic anemia, which affects the treatment dose and thus affects the efficacy of RBV-based antiviral therapies.^[6–9]^ One study also suggested that besides hemolytic anemia, *ITPA* SNPs are related to the efficacy of antiviral medications directly in patients infected with HCV genotype 2/3.^[12]^

A genome-wide association study of ITPA found that the *ITPA* rs7270101 and rs1127354 were related to the risk for RBV-induced hemolytic anemia during RBV-based therapy for CHC. *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype CA/AA and rs7270101 genotype AC/CC were related with a lower incidence of hemolytic anemia,^[24]^ which has been confirmed by other studies.^[6,7]^ However, reports from Asia did not find rs7270101 polymorphisms. For the first time, the present study investigated the distribution of ITPA polymorphisms in CHC patients residing in Northeast Chinese. We found that the rates of rs1127354 genotype CC were 76.2% for HCV genotype 1 and 77.6% for HCV non-genotype 1, which are close to those reported in Japanese (72.8%) and Korean (81.0%) populations,^[6,7]^ but lower than those reported by studies in Europe (85.0%) and the USA (86.8%).^[8,9]^ We did not find rs7270101 polymorphisms that had been identified in the European and American populations.

Our data showed that the incidence of anemia was higher in patients with *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype CC than in those with non-CC during the first 4 weeks after antiviral treatment (35.8% vs 2.0% in HCV genotype 1, 39.2% vs 2.1% in HCV non-genotype 1). Our data were similar to that reported by studies in Japan (35.4%) and Korea (16.5%),^[6,7]^ but lower than that reported by a study in the USA (41.9%).^[24]^ This difference may be associated with the high percentage of *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype non-CC in Asian individuals.

To investigate whether there are direct associations between ITPA SNPs and anti-HCV efficacy as well as long-term prognosis, the 5-year virological response and prognosis of disease were analyzed in 442 patients who received 80% of the planned treatment dose. The data showed that patients with *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype non-CC, presented a higher rate of SVR and 5-year virological response, regardless of HCV genotype. Moreover, the result was independent of RBV dose and antiviral treatment course. A previous study in Japan reported that a higher antiviral efficacy was observed in patients with *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype non-CC than those with CC, in patients with low HCV RNA levels and genotype 1.^[6]^ However, the RBV dose was not considered in their study. Here only patients who received 80% of the planned treatment dose were included for analysis. Our data suggested that patients with *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype non-CC showed a higher SVR and 5-year virological response than those with genotype CC, regardless HCV genotype and HCV RNA levels. As this effect was independent of RBV-induced hemolytic anemia, *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype non-CC was a direct affecter of the antiviral efficacy of Peg-IFN/RBV treatment.

In the present study, the improvement in liver fibrosis in patients who received 80% of the planned treatment dose was 24.9% (ITPA rs1127354 genotype CC) versus 36.2% (non-CC) for HCV genotype 1 and 27.6% (ITPA rs1127354 genotype CC) versus 34.2% (non-CC) for HCV non-genotype 1. Patients with ITPA rs1127354 genotype non-CC showed greater improvement than those with genotype CC. The total incidence of HCC was 1.36%, and all patients had *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype CC. This total incidence was lower than the 3.16% reported in the study where patients received DDA treatment.^[25]^ Multivariate analysis indicated that having *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype non-CC was an independent predictor for high improvement in liver fibrosis.

As DAAs were not available in China when we conducted this study, a DAA-treated group was not included in the present study. This is a major limitation of our study. We will further investigate the relationships between *ITPA* SNPs and the long-term prognosis of patients treated with DAAs in the future.

In conclusion, although DAAs improve the prognosis of CHC patients, Peg-IFN/RBV therapy is still applied in many countries. The incidence of HCC is only 1.36% in patients receiving Peg-IFN/RBV treatment, and no HCC was observed in patients with *ITPA* rs1127354 genotype non-CC even over the 5-year follow-up.
