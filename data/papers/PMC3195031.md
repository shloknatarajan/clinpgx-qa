## Abstract

Despite extensive clinical experience with efavirenz (EFV), unpredictable interindividual variabilities in efficacy and toxicity remain important limitations associated with the use of this antiretroviral. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors affecting EFV pharmacokinetics and to develop a pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic (PK/PG) model in a Caucasian population of HIV-infected patients. In total, 869 EFV plasma concentrations from 128 HIV-infected patients treated with EFV were quantitatively assessed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography technique. All patients were genotyped for 90 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for proteins involved in the metabolism and transport of EFV, using a MassArray platform provided by Sequenom. The influence of these polymorphisms on EFV pharmacokinetics and the effects of demographic, clinical, biochemical, lifestyle, and concurrent drug covariates were evaluated. Plasma concentrations were fitted by a one-compartment model, with first-order absorption and elimination using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM program). The CYP2B6*6 allele, multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) 1497C→T, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) were identified as major factors influencing the apparent EFV oral clearance (CL/F), reducing the initial interindividual variability by 54.8%, according to the model CL/F = (12.2 − 0.00279·GGT)·0.602CYP2B6*6 [G/T]·0.354CYP2B6*6 [T/T]·0.793MRP4 1497C→T, where CYP2B6*6 [G/T], CYP2B6*6 [T/T], and MRP4 1497C→T take values of 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of polymorphisms. The detailed genetic analysis conducted in this study identified two of 90 SNPs that significantly impacted CL/F, which might indicate that the remaining SNPs analyzed do not influence this PK parameter, at least in Caucasian populations with characteristics similar to those of our study population.

## INTRODUCTION

Efavirenz (EFV) is one of the most widely used and accepted nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) worldwide. This drug is used in combination with two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) because of the efficacy and safety shown for this combined therapy in many clinical trials ([14](#B14), [17](#B17), [54](#B54), [61](#B61)).

Although there can be wide interpatient differences, due to genetic and environmental factors, when comparing optimal drug concentrations to standard doses, all current treatment guidelines recommend fixed doses of antiretrovirals (ARVs). More importantly, several studies have demonstrated that drug concentrations are an important factor in patient response to ARV therapy and that there is a significant correlation between drug exposure and efficacy or toxicity. Thus, when EFV is administered at a fixed dosage of 600 mg once daily, some patients suffer from central nervous system toxicity (trough steady-state plasma concentration [C^ss^min] > 4 μg/ml) ([6](#B6), [29](#B29), [34](#B34), [42](#B42)) or fail to achieve durable viral load suppression (C^ss^min < 1 μg/ml) ([4](#B4), [18](#B18), [19](#B19), [22](#B22), [34](#B34), [37](#B37), [43](#B43)). These differential patient responses can, at least in part, be attributed to high interpatient variability in the disposition kinetics of EFV ([41](#B41)).

There are multiple factors affecting the pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of EFV, including ethnicity, gender, age, body weight, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, binding to plasma proteins, hepatic impairment, disease status, pregnancy, and host genetic factors ([7](#B7), [48](#B48), [55](#B55)). Nowadays, analysis of the influence of genetic factors is becoming increasingly important, because the existence of genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins involved in the metabolism or transport of ARVs may alter protein activity and therefore explain, in part, the high interpatient PK variability of these drugs ([12](#B12), [25](#B25), [40](#B40), [46](#B46)).

Cytochrome CYP2B6 is the main enzyme responsible for hydroxylation ([60](#B60)), with the partial involvement of CYP3A4/CYP3A5 and, according to recent studies, CYP2A6 ([1](#B1), [15](#B15), [31](#B31), [32](#B32)). In addition, several other CYPs, including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8, may also contribute, although their individual roles in EFV metabolism are not clearly defined ([1](#B1), [16](#B16), [22](#B22), [35](#B35), [50](#B50), [57](#B57)). Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes could change their activity, and this might explain a large part of the high interindividual PK variability of EFV.

Polymorphisms of CYP2B6 are the most frequently studied genetic polymorphisms to date. In particular, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CYP2B6 516G→T has been reported to be significantly associated with a pronounced reduction in enzyme activity and elevated EFV plasma concentrations in studies conducted on different populations ([1](#B1), [9](#B9), [11](#B11), [15](#B15), [20](#B20), [24](#B24), [31](#B31)–[33](#B33), [35](#B35), [36](#B36), [38](#B38), [44](#B44), [47](#B47), [49](#B49), [50](#B50), [57](#B57)). Thus, patients showing G/T and T/T CYP2B6 polymorphisms exhibited EFV clearances that were about 50% and 75% lower than those observed in patients without these polymorphisms (G/G) ([9](#B9)). More recently, the SNPs CYP2B6 983T→G and 785A→G were also reported to affect EFV plasma concentrations ([20](#B20), [21](#B21), [33](#B33), [44](#B44), [49](#B49), [50](#B50), [59](#B59)). These data have shown that poor CYP2B6 metabolizer genotypes can identify individuals at risk of high EFV plasma concentrations. With respect to other CYPs, only the CYP2A6 and CYP3A4/CYP3A5 accessory pathways appeared to influence EFV elimination independently of CYP2B6. Among those, the overall impact of CYP3A4 (rs4646437) was the largest; it accounted for 6% of clearance (CL) variability ([1](#B1)).

On the other hand, this PK variability of EFV could also be partly explained by polymorphisms of protein transporter genes. Two protein subfamilies are particularly involved in the transport of ARVs. These are the multidrug resistance (MDR)/TAP (subfamily B) and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP)/CFTR (subfamily C). Information on the functional role of these ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters on the disposition of EFV is relatively limited ([16](#B16), [22](#B22)).

Although genetic variations in MDR1 have been the most widely analyzed ([16](#B16), [22](#B22), [34](#B34), [51](#B51), [57](#B57)), their influence on PK is not clearly defined, and further studies are required to assess their clinical relevance. Similarly, genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for other protein transporters (MRP1, MRP2, and MRP4, for example) also require further investigation.

Knowledge of the influence of the genetic information on the PK of EFV could be successfully utilized for optimization therapy of this drug, because only a modest part of this variability could be explained by demographic variables or the concomitant use of other drugs.

A population-based approach, which integrates pharmacogenetic (PG) data with PK studies, is very suitable for capturing the contribution of multiple genetic factors on the PK of EFV and, in particular, would permit the adequate characterization of PK phenotypes. However, although population PK analyses on EFV have been reported in the literature ([1](#B1), [9](#B9), [13](#B13), [36](#B36), [42](#B42)), only some of these have integrated PG information ([1](#B1), [9](#B9), [36](#B36)).

Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to analyze the potential influence of a large number of SNPs (90) in genes coding for proteins involved in the metabolism and transport of EFV through the development of a population-based PK/PG model in 128 HIV-infected patients.

The results of this study can be used to improve the prediction of EFV plasma concentrations and optimize its dose in ARV therapy. This study complements our previously published report ([9](#B9)) in which we investigated the influence of CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and MDR1 genotypes on EFV kinetics in 32 patients and obtained a final model in which only the effect of the CYP2B6 516G→T polymorphism had an influence on efavirenz clearance; this covariate reduced the intersubject variability of clearance by about 27%.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Study population and design.

The population-based PK/PG analysis was conducted on 128 HIV-positive patients treated with EFV, from the outpatient unit of the Pharmacy Service of the University Hospital of Salamanca (Spain). Patient inclusion criteria were as follows: confirmed HIV infection, treatment with EFV for at least 3 months (at an unchanged EFV dosage for at least 1 month), adherence to the treatment regimen of >90%, age of ≥18 years, and no comedication with known inducer or inhibitor drugs. All patients included in this study provided written, informed consent for genetic testing, and the study was subjected to approval by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Salamanca.

All patients were initially administered 600 mg of oral EFV once a day in combination with two NRTIs as part of their ARV regimen. Approximately 20% of patients required dose adjustments (range, 200 to 1,000 mg/day) to achieve therapeutic concentrations of EFV, with one patient even requiring 1,600 mg/day due to the absence of a clinical response to lower doses ([10](#B10)).

All patients were included in a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) program, and plasma samples for EFV concentration assays and for viral and biochemical tests were drawn periodically at 3- to 6-month intervals during follow-up visits to the hospital. Individual patient information was carefully recorded at the same time, including dose history, sampling time, time of last dose, sex, age, weight, height, concomitant pathologies (hepatitis C [HCV]), concomitant treatment (ARVs and other drugs), and lifestyle factors (tobacco use and alcohol consumption). Treatment adherence was measured according to dispensing records and a simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ) ([30](#B30)); when this questionnaire provided an adherence of >90%, a coefficient of variation (CV) of the mean EFV plasma concentration/dose ratio of less than 30% was used as an additional criterion according to intrapatient variability previously observed ([13](#B13)). Data concerning clinical evolution (CD4^+^, plasma viral load), biochemical parameters related to liver function (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase [GGT], total bilirubin [TB], platelets [PLT], and indexes to predict liver fibrosis [APRI, FIB4, Forns]), renal function (serum creatinine [SCR]), and lipid profile (total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides [TG], low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) were also collected.

The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients included in this study are shown in [Table 1](#T1).

### Sampling and drug assays.

Most blood samples were collected at midpoint of the dosage interval, between 8 and 20 h after EFV administration, under steady-state conditions (unchanged dosage for ≥1 month). The mean number of EFV plasma concentrations per patient was 4.59 ± 2.84, resulting in a final database of 869 concentrations, which were used to develop the population PK/PG model.

Blood samples (5 ml) were collected, and plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 3,000 × *g*. Samples were stored at −20°C (following virus inactivation in a water bath at 60°C for 60 min) until analysis. The stability under these conditions is adequate, since the slope of calibration curves of EFV established in samples submitted to the thermostatting procedure was slightly lower (3.93% ± 1.57%) than that obtained with nonheated samples.

EFV concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Waters, Milford, MA) with UV detection at 215 nm, following solid-phase extraction using a GX-271 ASPEC (Gilson, Villiers le Bel, France). This method was validated over a concentration range of 0.5 to 10 μg/ml, using 600 μl of plasma. Recovery of EFV from human plasma was 107.4%. Intra- and interday CV precisions were consistently <5.7% for all internal quality controls (0.5, 2.0, and 10.0 μg/ml). The quantification limit was 0.25 μg/ml, and the absence of interference from the 21 drugs most often used in HIV patients was confirmed. Our analysis laboratory successfully participates in the International Interlaboratory Quality Control Program for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in HIV Infection (Dutch Association for Quality Assessment in Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology [KKGT]).

### SNP selection.

Characterized SNPs were selected on the basis of their potential or identified influence on the functionality of enzymes and transporters of EFV, obtained from public databases (CYP alleles, [www.cypalleles.ki.se](http://www.cypalleles.ki.se); dbSNP, [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) and Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain [CEPH] panel from the HapMap database, [www.hapmap.org](http://www.hapmap.org)). A total of 90 SNPs (8 SNPs in CYP2B6, 6 SNPs in CYP2A6, 25 SNPs in CYP2D6, 3 SNPs in CYP2C8, 3 SNPs in CYP2C19, 4 SNPs in CYP2C9, 2 SNPs in CYP3A4, 7 SNPs in CYP3A5, 5 SNPs in MDR1, 3 SNPs in MRP1, 8 SNPs in MRP2, 11 SNPs in MRP4, 1 SNP in UGT2B7, 1 SNP in ABCA1, and 3 SNPs in BCRP) were chosen using the above criteria and included in the analysis. SNPs investigated and their frequencies in the patients included in this study are shown in Table [2](#T2).

### Genotyping analysis.

All genotyping experiments were conducted at the Spanish National Genotyping Center (CeGen).

Genomic DNA was isolated automatically from 5 ml of whole human blood with magnetic bead technology using the Chemagic Magnetic Separation Module I and the Chemagic DNA kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Chemagen AG, Baesweiler, Germany).

Genotyping was performed mainly using a MassArray platform provided by Sequenom. This method involves multiplex PCR amplification of up to 7 SNPs. Excess nucleotides are removed by treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and multiplex primer extension is performed using a mix of deoxy- and dideoxynucleotides, so that products of different masses are obtained for each allele of each SNP. Resulting products are resolved by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).

Prior to genotyping by Sequenom, two genes (the CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 genes) were amplified and separated from their respective pseudogenes, using different methodologies as previously described ([52](#B52)). In addition, some SNPs of CYP2A6 (rs28399454, rs34816076) and CYP3A5 (rs28365095) could not be analyzed by Sequenom and were instead analyzed using real-time PCR TaqMan drug metabolism genotyping assays.

### Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic model development.

A population-based PK/PG model of EFV was built using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM) (version VI; double precision, level 2.0) ([3](#B3)). The first-order conditional estimation method (FOCE) was used in conjunction with the Laplace approximation for all models tested during model development, and the concentrations were fitted on a linear scale.

A one-compartment, open kinetic model with first-order absorption and elimination (specified to NONMEM by the ADVAN2 and TRANS2 routines) was assumed. Because of the nature of the data, the absorption rate constant (*Ka*) could not be estimated and was fixed at 0.3 h^−1^, a *Ka* value previously reported ([13](#B13)). Therefore, estimated fixed-effect PK parameters included the apparent clearance (CL/F) and the apparent distribution volume (V/F). Both additive and exponential error models were tested to explain interindividual and residual variability, as described in our previous study ([9](#B9)).

To elucidate the preliminary relationships between the individual PK parameters and covariates, a graphical approach for the exploratory data analysis and the stepwise generalized additive model (GAM) implemented in Xpose were used ([26](#B26)). The resulting, potentially important, covariates were then selected and incorporated in a stepwise manner into the basic model to develop the intermediate and full models.

The inclusion of a fixed-effect parameter in the basic model quantifies the relationship between a particular PK parameter and a covariate. If the covariate is included, then a significant proportion of the overall variability is explained by this systematic component and thus the magnitude of the unexplained variability is reduced. In this way, the model improves future individual predictions. Quantitative covariates (age, total body weight [TBW], body mass index [BMI], ALT, AST, GGT, TB, PLT, TC, TG, LDL, and SCR) were included in both linear and nonlinear fits. Discrete covariates (gender and concomitant drugs) were tested in the model as binary variables (0 or 1 for female or male, respectively, and 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of a concomitant drug during the treatment, respectively). PG covariates also took values of 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of polymorphisms, respectively. All discrete covariates were examined using a multiplicative model, in order to obtain the fractional increase or decrease in the associated PK parameter.

The criteria for retention of a particular covariate in the model were as follows: (i) the objective function value difference (OFVD) between two hierarchical models must be at least 3.84 (df = 1) in order to achieve the desired level of statistical significance (α < 0.05); (ii) reduction in unexplained interindividual variability for the associated PK parameter; (iii) randomly distributed weighted residuals (WRES) and individual weighted residuals (IWRES); (iv) a closer relationship between predicted and observed concentrations; (v) the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the covariate effect must exclude zero (or the unit for discrete covariates); and (vi) the standard errors (SE) should not take values representing more than 25% and 50% of the value of estimated fixed and random parameters, respectively.

Besides, for a covariate to be considered clinically relevant, a change in the typical population PK parameter estimate of ±20% was required.

The generated full model was then subjected to backward elimination, where each model parameter was fixed to zero, using more stringent criteria for statistical significance (α < 0.01).

### Model qualification.

To qualify the predictive performance of the model proposed for EFV, normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDE) were computed, as described by Brendel et al. ([5](#B5)), from 500 replicates for each observed data point generated by NONMEM for the patient groups that received different doses according to the covariates found to affect CL/F in a relevant way. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Fisher's test were used to test whether the mean and the variance were significantly different from 0 and 1, respectively, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to probe if NPDE followed an N (0, 1) distribution ([5](#B5)). Complementary statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 15; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) ([53](#B53)).

## RESULTS

The mean EFV plasma concentration was measured to be 3.18 (±1.61) μg/ml, with a range between 0.84 and 15.16 μg/ml, suggesting high interindividual EFV drug disposition variability.

A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination fit the data appropriately. In the basic model, which did not consider covariates, mean values for CL/F and V/F were 9.61 liters/h (SE = 4.03%) and 291 liters (SE = 15.4%), with interindividual variability values (well described by proportional error models) of 43.7% and 101%, respectively. Residual variability, also according to a proportional error model, was 17.3%.

Graphical exploratory analysis of the relationship between individual Bayesian CL/F and V/F values estimated by NONMEM (using the POSTHOC option) and nongenetic covariates by GAM revealed that age, sex, GGT, and concomitant treatment with lamivudine and emtricitabine showed some influence on CL/F, whereas only BMI, and to a lesser extent TBW, showed any influence on V/F. The influence of these covariates on CL/F is shown in [Table 3](#T3), which summarizes the most significant models evaluated, including the main parameters used in their discrimination. Despite the observed decrease in OFV when included in the model, only age and GGT had a statistically significant effect on CL/F (model 6 in [Table 3](#T3)). This CL/F model resulted in a reduction in OFV of 17.92 (α < 0.01), and the interindividual variability in CL/F and the residual were insignificantly reduced.

With respect to PG covariates, expressed as SNPs, only 10 (CYP2B6 516G→T, CYP2B6 785A→G, CYP2B6 1459C→T, CYP2A6 86G→A, CYP3A4 392A→G, CYP2C19 681G→A, MDR1 61A→G, MRP4 3463A→G, MRP4 1497C→T, MRP4 912G→T) of the 90 SNPs analyzed showed a specific influence on individual CL/F in preliminary exploratory GAM analysis. These SNPs were added one by one on the previously accepted model (model 6 in [Table 3](#T3)). The following covariates significantly improved OFV, showing an effect on CL/F of less than 15%: CYP2B6 1459C→T (7%); MRP4 3463A→G (9%), and MRP4 912G→T (14%). Only two CYP2B6 SNPs (516G→T and 785A→G) showed a change in CL/F of ≥20% (the value selected to accept a covariate as clinically relevant). Because they both define allele 6 of this isoenzyme (CYP2B6*6), these SNPs were considered together as two covariates for homo- and heterozygous (CYP2B6*6 [T/T] and CYP2B6*6 [G/T], respectively) genotypes. The inclusion of these covariates in the model resulted in a reduced OFV of 168.12 units with respect to the basic model and a >54% change in CL/F interindividual variability (29.39% versus 43.70%). When these genetic covariates were included in the model, a deficient estimation of the parameter quantifying contribution of age was observed, and so age had to be excluded of the CL/F model. In fact, its elimination decreased OFV in 7.45 units (model 8 versus model 7).

Although the inclusion of MRP4 969G→A, MRP4 3463A→G, and MRP4 1497C→T reduced OFV by more than 3.84 units, only inclusion of MRP4 1497C→T changed the magnitude of CL/F >20% and so, although it insignificantly influences the interindividual variability of CL/F, was considered in the final model.

In conclusion, the final model adopted for CL/F was as follows: CL/F = (θ_1_ + θ_3_·GGT)·θ_4_^CYP2B6*6 [G/T]^·θ_5_^CYP2B6*6 [T/T]^· θ_6_^MRP4 1497C→T^, where θ_1_ through θ_6_ are fixed parameters (θ_2_ was the coefficient for V/F) and CYP2B6*6 [G/T], CYP2B6*6 [T/T], and MRP4 1497C→T were assigned a value of 0 or 1 according to the absence or presence of polymorphisms.

Regarding V/F, none of the covariates could be included in the final model, not even TBW and BMI, which were previously selected by GAM, because these covariates did not fulfill the required statistical criteria. This may explain why CV_V/F_ barely reduced, from 100.29% in the basic model to 86.91% in the final model. Residual variability decreased less than 5% in the final model in comparison with that of the basic model (16.82% versus 17.29%). The OFV difference between the basic and the final model is 191.616 (df = 5), so the critical value of χ^2^ is 11.070 and consequently fulfills the statistically required criteria (*P* < 0.05). [Table 4](#T4) shows the parameters included in the final population PK/PG model proposed for EFV.

In addition, examination of the scatterplot of weighted residuals versus predicted concentrations obtained from the final model revealed a significant improvement in pattern (random distribution) with respect to the basic model, in agreement with the OFV decrease (difference in OFV, 191.61; α < 0.01). With the exception of GGT (SE = 36.6%), random and fixed-effect parameters were estimated with an SE of <20%. [Figure 1](#F1) shows scatterplots of measured versus predicted EFV concentrations by the basic and the final models. These plots show an improvement in fit for the final model, reflected as tighter scatter around the identity line. Furthermore, the linear regression correlation coefficient between the observed versus the fitted population concentrations was 0.660 for the final model, which is significantly better than the 0.07 obtained for the basic model.

The results obtained in the model qualification support the final model proposed for a simulated population, as described in Materials and Methods. [Figure 2](#F2) shows the Q-Q plot of the EFV NPDE distribution in patients with G/G, G/T, and T/T genotypes in CYP2B6*6 versus the uniform distribution. The means and variances of these NPDE were found to be 0.023 (SE = 0.042) and 0.935 (SE = 0.21) for G/G, −0.051 (SE = 0.049) and 0.847 (SE = 0.18) for G/T, and 0.099 (SE = 0.133) and 0.993 (SE = 0.23) for T/T genotypes. The probabilities found by Wilcoxon signed-rank (0.302, 0.149, and 0.052 for G/G, G/T, and T/T genotypes, respectively) and Fisher's (0.722, 0.678, and 0.864 for G/G, G/T, and T/T genotypes, respectively) tests were greater than 0.05; thus, we can accept both null hypotheses (mean = 0 and variance = 1).

Normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDE) applied to the three relevant dose groups defined by the CYP2B6 genotypes.

Besides, as shown in [Fig. 2](#F2), the assumption of N (0, 1) distributions appears to be reasonable since deviations from the identity lines show minimal departures from the expected distribution. In fact, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that NPDE followed an N (0, 1) distribution (*P* value of 0.629, 0.716, and 0.799 for G/G, G/T, and T/T genotypes, respectively); hence, the hypothesis tested can be accepted, and the model proposed can be considered adequate.

## DISCUSSION

The overall aim of this study was to analyze the potential influence of SNPs present in genes coding for the main metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters through the development of a PK/PG model that could be used as a tool to optimize the EFV dosage, in clinical practice, for Caucasian patients infected with HIV. Although some population PK/PG models have previously been reported ([1](#B1), [9](#B9), [36](#B36)), this is the first study to extensively examine the combined effects of a large number (90) of different SNPs.

In order to develop this PK/PG model, a one-compartment linear model was used in this study due to the nature of the data (sparse TDM data) and the fact that this model was chosen in most of the previously published EFV PK studies ([9](#B9), [13](#B13), [38](#B38), [42](#B42), [44](#B44)).

Preliminary results suggested the incorporation of gender and age for CL/F and BMI or TBW for V/F. However, no demographic covariates could be included in the final model due to the statistical criteria. Despite some controversy in the literature regarding sex and body size (TBW or BMI), these results are consistent with most EFV population studies ([9](#B9), [13](#B13), [27](#B27), [28](#B28), [42](#B42)).

With respect to the clinical covariates, only the biochemical markers of liver function showed an influence on CL/F. This correlation seems logical, because EFV is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism ([45](#B45)). On the other hand, due to the tight correlation between different biochemical markers, only GGT was selected as the best predictor of this PK parameter. This result should be interpreted with caution, because the influence of GGT is significant only at the very high values attributed to an important impairment in liver function. Thus, a 20% decrease in CL/F was obtained for values >1,155 U/liter. However, this result could be useful for predicting the risk of toxicity in patients with these GGT values who are receiving standard EFV doses.

With respect to the concomitant ARVs, although the inclusion of lamivudine, zidovudine, and emtricitabine on CL/F significantly reduced the OFV, this influence was less than 10%, a value significantly lower than the selected criterion of 20%. In general, most studies confirmed that the coadministration of EFV with these ARVs did not significantly affect the PK of EFV ([13](#B13), [36](#B36)), and only Stöhr et al. ([55](#B55)) reported a 25% reduction in the EFV plasma concentration when it was used in combination with zidovudine.

Previous studies examined the influence of genetic covariates on the kinetic behavior of EFV ([7](#B7), [9](#B9), [11](#B11), [20](#B20), [21](#B21), [33](#B33), [34](#B34), [38](#B38), [42](#B42), [50](#B50), [51](#B51), [57](#B57), [59](#B59)), primarily SNPs in genes coding for the main metabolizing enzymes. The CYP2B6 gene is highly polymorphic, with numerous SNPs and associated haplotypes. A higher frequency of these SNPs was observed in black populations (≈45%) than in Caucasians (≈ 22%) and Asians (≈ 17%), who have not been studied as frequently (see [http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm](http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm) and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/)). From the CYP2B6 SNPs analyzed, only 516G→T and 785A→G, which constitute the CYP2B6*6 allele, were able to explain an important part of the EFV CL/F interindividual variability. None of the remaining SNPs showed any significant influence, although these results were inconclusive because of the low frequency or even absence of these polymorphisms in the population studied (see [Table 2](#T2)). To date, the SNPs 1459C→T and 64C→T have not been identified as being responsible for the significant changes in EFV metabolism, whereas SNPs 983T→C, 136A→G, 593T→C, and 1132C→T have been associated with high EFV plasma concentrations, especially when present with the 516G→T polymorphism and in black populations ([21](#B21), [49](#B49)).

With respect to the CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 SNPs, their influence on EFV CL/F was not significant, a result that is consistent with previous studies ([16](#B16), [35](#B35), [51](#B51), [56](#B56), [57](#B57)), suggesting that these isoenzymes play a minor role in EFV metabolism. Only Arab-Alameddine et al. ([1](#B1)) found that the SNP 17163G→T of CYP3A4 influenced CL/F, but again this effect was observed only in patients with impaired CYP2B6.

To date, the CYP2A6 isoenzyme has been little studied, although its contribution to EFV metabolism is gaining in importance. None of the CYP2A6 SNPs (see [Table 2](#T2)) were included in the final model, although 86G→A did show some influence on EFV CL/F in the preliminary GAM analysis. In only a few studies were patients with the CYP2B6 slow-metabolizer genotype and the CYP2A6 polymorphism associated with a higher drug area under the curve (AUC) and a lower CL/F ([1](#B1), [15](#B15)).

Of the remaining isoenzymes tested (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6), only CYP2C19 681G→A displayed a tendency to reduce EFV CL/F, but obeying the statistical criterion was not included in the model (the difference in OFV was <3.84). Only Fellay et al. ([16](#B16)) reported a trend of higher plasma EFV levels for the CYP2D6 SNPs in patients with CYP2B6 polymorphism. No other studies have analyzed these polymorphisms, most likely because their contributions to EFV metabolism might be small and remain poorly understood.

Furthermore, only a few studies have analyzed the influence of polymorphisms in membrane transporters, with inconclusive results. This study examined fundamentally efflux transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp; encoded by the MDR1 gene). Because several MDR1 genetic polymorphisms have been shown to influence the absorption and disposition of some ARVs ([9](#B9), [16](#B16), [22](#B22), [23](#B23), [27](#B27), [34](#B34), [36](#B36), [51](#B51), [57](#B57)), this gene has been the best studied. Of all of the MDR1 SNPs analyzed in this study (see [Table 2](#T2)), only 61A→G displayed a tendency to increase EFV concentrations in carriers of the CYP2B6*6 allele (genotype T/T). A reduction in OFV of <3.84, due to the low frequency of both polymorphisms together (only observed in one patient) in the population, prevented its inclusion in the model. This observation, coupled with the fact that no previous studies examined the influence of these SNPs, suggests that further studies on larger numbers of patients with this polymorphism are required to confirm this result. No significant effect of the MDR1 3435C→T SNP was found on PK behavior, despite its high frequency (68.8%) in our population, which is in agreement with the results of previous studies ([22](#B22), [23](#B23), [51](#B51), [57](#B57)), except for one, which reported a decrease in EFV plasma concentrations ([16](#B16)). The remainder of the MDR1 SNPs analyzed did not show any significant influence on CL/F or V/F. Only one of these SNPs, 2677G→T, was previously analyzed by other groups, who all found similar results ([22](#B22), [23](#B23)).

Of the efflux transporters analyzed, several MRP4 SNPs (1497C→T, 3463A→G, and 969G→A) appeared to be the most relevant, because they appeared to have an influence on CL/F, although only 1497C→T was included in the final model. The EFV CL/F decreased by a factor of 0.79 for patients with a heterozygous genotype, possibly due to a decreased protein expression, which would have caused an increase in F. Although this SNP significantly reduced the OFV (5.02) and implies an influence on CL/F of >20%, its contribution toward reducing CL/F variability was minimal, probably due to the low frequency (3.20% heterozygous) found for this polymorphism and the fact that no patient had a double mutation (homozygous genotype). The SNPs related to MRP1 and MRP2 had no influence on the PK of EFV, in agreement with the results of Fellay et al. ([16](#B16)), and no other studies have analyzed these SNPs.

SNPs related to MRP1 and MRP2 (see [Table 2](#T2)) had no influence on the PK of EFV, and no other studies have analyzed these SNPs, with the exception of Fellay et al. ([16](#B16)), who reported similar results.

The fact that previous studies found CYP2B6 polymorphisms to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of EFV is noteworthy. Furthermore, the influence of polymorphisms in other isoenzymes and transporters was usually observed when associated with carriers of the CYP2B6*6 allele. In our study, this allele was also found to be the most important; however, the low frequency or absence of these SNPs, in combination with other polymorphisms, limited our ability to determine the influence of these combinations. Therefore, it would be interesting to conduct multicenter clinical studies encompassing larger numbers of Caucasian patients in order to include more patients with these kinds of combinations.

According to the PK parameters obtained from the final model, the average EFV CL/F in patients with normal GGT values (12 to 55 U/liter) and without the CYP2B6 isoenzyme or MRP4 transporter polymorphisms was 12.51 liters/h, in agreement with the range of clearances (8.82 to 11.7 liters/h) previously reported ([1](#B1), [9](#B9), [15](#B15), [27](#B27), [28](#B28), [42](#B42), [44](#B44)). When the CYP2B6 polymorphisms were included, the CL/F values were 4.31 and 7.23 liters/h for patients with the T/T and G/T genotypes, respectively. These results are similar to those previously reported in other studies, highlighting the likely overexposure to EFV of patients with G/T or T/T genotypes who received the standard dose of 600 mg/day ([1](#B1), [9](#B9), [38](#B38)). In fact, the incorporation of these polymorphisms in our population model explained over 54% of the PK interindividual CL/F variability and justified the *a priori* determination to initiate EFV treatment with an appropriate dose. The EFV CL/F was reduced to 9.58 liters/h only when MRP4 polymorphisms and normal values of GGT (40 U/liter) were present.

The final proposed model should be used with caution and only when there are polymorphisms in either CYP2B6 or MRP4 but not both, because this model was developed from data where only one patient had both polymorphisms, and thus there are no guarantees that this model would correctly predict, *a priori*, EFV CL/F. An *a priori* reduction to 400 and 200 mg/day for the CYP2B6 G/T and T/T genotypes, respectively, is recommended by our study, in agreement with others ([1](#B1), [8](#B8), [9](#B9), [31](#B31), [56](#B56)). [Figure 3](#F3) shows the simulated plasma concentration time profiles at the recommended doses of 600, 400, and 200 mg/day for patients with the G/G, G/T, and T/T genotypes of CYP2B6*6, respectively; a similar range of EFV plasma concentrations can be observed for the three recommended dose levels. However, the desirability of reducing EFV doses in patients with MRP4 polymorphisms and high GGT levels still requires further investigation into the influence of these covariates on a larger number of patients in order to confirm the results obtained in this study.

Mean (solid lines) and 90% prediction intervals (dotted lines) of the simulated plasma concentration-time profiles of efavirenz for patients with CYP2B6*6 G/G (A), CYP2B6*6 G/T (B), and CYP2B6*6 T/T (C), who received doses of 600 mg/day, 400 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively.

The V/F of 247 liters, estimated with a higher level of uncertainty than the CL/F, is within the range of values (150 to 421 liters) established by other authors ([1](#B1), [9](#B9), [15](#B15), [27](#B27), [28](#B28), [42](#B42), [44](#B44)). The fact that it was not possible to include any covariate in this PK parameter justifies the higher interindividual variability than was found for the CL/F.

The final model proposed is simple and similar to the model previously published by our research group ([9](#B9)). It is easily applicable in clinical practice, because it can be implemented in PK software, which allows us to predict the PK parameters from data obtained in the TDM and therefore to *a priori* determine the appropriate dose for each patient.

Finally, although the model covariates explained a significant proportion of the interindividual variability in EFV kinetics, this remained relatively high, whereas the residual variability was low. Because of this, the use of the TDM to appropriately adjust initial *a priori* doses is recommended. Furthermore, the implementation of this proposed population PK/PG model in a Bayesian algorithm would be useful for the individualization of EFV dosages based on data obtained from the TDM.
