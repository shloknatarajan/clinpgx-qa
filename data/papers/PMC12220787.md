## Abstract

**Background:** 
Aripiprazole (ARI) is the first-line treatment for tic disorders (TD). Cytochrome P450(CYP)2D6 (CYP2D6) and ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member 1 (ABCB1) transporter are involved in the metabolism of ARI. However, whether CYP2D6 and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms influence clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ARI remains unclear.

**Methods:** 
CYP2D6 and ABCB1 genotyping were performed. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ARI and its metabolite dehydroaripiprazole (DARI) were derived using a previously established population pharmacokinetic model. Drug response after ARI administration was evaluated based on reduction rate of Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score (YGTSS).

**Results:** 
Steady-state DARI/ARI metabolic ratios (MRs) of AUC0 − t, Cmin and Cmax were significantly associated with CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs5030865, CYP2D6 rs1058164, CYP2D6 rs28371702, CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989. The clearance (CL) of ARI was influenced by CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs5030865, and CYP2D6 rs1080989. CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs29001518 and CYP2D6 rs1080985 were correlated with the CL of DARI. The CYP2D6 rs5030865 polymorphism was associated with volume of distribution (V) of DARI. The ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) polymorphism influenced the V of ARI. CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989 were significantly associated with drug response of ARI.

**Conclusion:** 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of ARI were correlated with CYP2D6 polymorphisms. CYP2D6 genotyping was recommended in ARI therapy. Further researches are required to elucidate the role of ABCB1 polymorphisms in ARI metabolism.

### Background

Aripiprazole (ARI) is the first-line treatment for tic disorders (TD). Cytochrome P450(CYP)2D6 (CYP2D6) and ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member 1 (ABCB1) transporter are involved in the metabolism of ARI. However, whether CYP2D6 and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms influence clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ARI remains unclear.

### Methods

CYP2D6 and ABCB1 genotyping were performed. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ARI and its metabolite dehydroaripiprazole (DARI) were derived using a previously established population pharmacokinetic model. Drug response after ARI administration was evaluated based on reduction rate of Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score (YGTSS).

### Results

Steady-state DARI/ARI metabolic ratios (MRs) of AUC_0 − t_, C_min_ and C_max_ were significantly associated with CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs5030865, CYP2D6 rs1058164, CYP2D6 rs28371702, CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989. The clearance (CL) of ARI was influenced by CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs5030865, and CYP2D6 rs1080989. CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs29001518 and CYP2D6 rs1080985 were correlated with the CL of DARI. The CYP2D6 rs5030865 polymorphism was associated with volume of distribution (V) of DARI. The ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) polymorphism influenced the V of ARI. CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989 were significantly associated with drug response of ARI.

### Conclusion

Pharmacokinetic parameters of ARI were correlated with CYP2D6 polymorphisms. CYP2D6 genotyping was recommended in ARI therapy. Further researches are required to elucidate the role of ABCB1 polymorphisms in ARI metabolism.

## Materials and methods

### Study design

A total of 84 outpatients treated at the Department of Pediatric Neurology of Wuhan Children’s Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 2021 to July 2022 were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were included in the pharmacokinetic study if they were: Chinese Children aged 0–18 years diagnosed with TD, ARI monotherapy or add-on therapy, normal laboratory findings (blood chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), absence of severe organic diseases. Patients were excluded if they were: incomplete clinical data, participation in other clinical trials within the previous month, poor compliance, or loss to follow-up. Patients were enrolled in pharmacodynamic study if YGTSS total scores ≥ 25 besides the inclusion criteria listed above.

### Blood sampling, SNP testing and data collection

The pediatric patients were daily given ARI at a dose of 1.25-5 mg/d in the first week, then gradually increased to the target dose 2.5–20 mg/d with the interval of at least one week. 143 ARI and 117 DARI serum concentrations were collected randomly after orally taking ARI for at least 14 consecutive days. The serum concentrations of ARI and DARI were tested by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to the established pharmacokinetic model in our previous study [[16](#CR16)]. SNP detection was determined by 3730XL Sequencer (ABI, Inc., USA) by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Totally 27 SNPs were tested by first-generation sequencing method, including CYP2D6*3 (rs35742686), CYP2D6*4 (rs3892097), CYP2D6*6 (rs5030655), CYP2D6*9 (rs5030656), CYP2D6*14 (rs5030865), CYP2D6*17 (rs28371706), CYP2D6*33 (rs28371717), CYP2D6*35 (rs769258), CYP2D6*41 (rs28371725), CYP2D6*49 (rs1135822), CYP2D6*51 (rs72549348), CYP2D6*54 (rs267608297), CYP2D6*69 (rs267608289), CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs1058164, CYP2D6 rs28371705, CYP2D6 rs28371703, CYP2D6 rs28371702, CYP2D6 rs28371699, CYP2D6 rs29001518, CYP2D6 rs1080995, CYP2D6 rs1065852, CYP2D6 rs1080989, CYP2D6 rs1080985, ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) and ABCB1 G2677T/A (rs2032582).

### Clinical efficacy evaluation

YGTSS scale is an internationally recognized and standardized assessment tool for evaluating the severity of tic disorders. It was used to evaluate clinical efficacy at 4th and 8th week of ARI treatment, including motor tic score, vocal tic score and functional impairment score [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)]. TD cases were classified as mild (YGTSS total scores < 25), moderate (25–50), or severe (> 50). Clinical response was estimated according to YGTSS score reduction rate (%). YGTSS score reduction rate (%) = (total scores before treatment - total scores after treatment)/total score before treatment × 100%. YGTSS score reduction rate < 50% relative to baseline was categorized as ineffective, whereas ≥ 50% was deemed effective. Adverse events were monitored and recorded throughout the treatment period.

### Allele frequencies & Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test

Based on prior literatures [[14](#CR14), [15](#CR15)], 27 SNPs were analyzed: 25 in CYP2D6 and 2 in ABCB1, involving CYP2D6*3 (rs35742686), CYP2D6*4 (rs3892097), CYP2D6*6 (rs5030655), CYP2D6*9 (rs5030656), CYP2D6*14 (rs5030865), CYP2D6*17 (rs28371706), CYP2D6*33 (rs28371717), CYP2D6*35 (rs769258), CYP2D6*41 (rs28371725), CYP2D6*49 (rs1135822), CYP2D6*51 (rs72549348), CYP2D6*54 (rs267608297), CYP2D6*69 (rs267608289), CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs1058164, CYP2D6 rs28371705, CYP2D6 rs28371703, CYP2D6 rs28371702, CYP2D6 rs28371699, CYP2D6 rs29001518, CYP2D6 rs1080995, CYP2D6 rs1065852, CYP2D6 rs1080989, CYP2D6 rs1080985, ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582). Allele frequencies for the CYP2D6 and ABCB1 SNPs were assessed for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the chi-square test [[19](#CR19)]. SNPs with *P* > 0.05 were considered to conform to HWE and retained for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis; others were excluded. If it is not in HWE, the SNP would be excluded. The results of HWE test were shown in Supplementary Table [S1](#MOESM1) online. HWE analysis identified 18 CYP2D6 SNPs and 1 ABCB1 SNP consistent with the genetic mutation profile (*P*>0.05).

Based on metabolic phenotype classification criteria in PharmGKB/Parmvar and consensus from Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) [[20](#CR20)–[22](#CR22)], patients were categorized into ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs), extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and poor metabolizers (PMs). UMs were defined as carrying more than 2 normal function alleles, e.g. *1*1, *1*2, *2*2. NMs were defined as carrying 1 functional allele, e.g. *1*10, *1*33. IMs were defined as carrying 1 decreased-function allele and 1 non-function allele or carrying 2 decreased-function alleles, e.g. *3*10, *10*10. PMs were defined as carrying 2 non-function alleles, e.g. *3*3. The CYP2D6 phenotypes and activity scores were shown in Table [1](#Tab1).

### Table 1.

| CYP2D6 phenotypes | CPIC AS | genotypes | Number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UMs | > 2 | *1/*1 (1) | 15 (17.86%) |

### Acquisition of Pharmacokinetic parameters

Post hoc pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from individual concentration data and the published population pharmacokinetic model [[16](#CR16)]. The MR formulas was shown in Eq. ([1](#Equ1)):

| Category | Value 1 |
| --- | --- |
|   | 1 |
#### Note:

PK, pharmacokinetic; MR, metabolic ratio.

### Statistics analysis

Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS version 26). *P* value < 0.05 was considered to be of statistically significance. Continuous data with normal distribution are presented as mean vs. standard deviation, while non-normally distributed data are presented as median and interquartile range. For continuous data, analysis of variance was used to compare data with normal distribution, while data with non-normal distribution were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test to compare between two groups, or the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare multiple groups. Multiple post hoc comparisons would be performed to compare difference between two groups when *P* < 0.05 was shown in Kruskal-Wallis test (Bonferroni correction method, *P* < 0.0167 was considered statistically significant). Chi-square test was used to test difference in the distribution of categorical variables.

## Results

### The effects of CYP2D6 and ABCB1 gene polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of ARI and DARI

MR_AUC0−t_, MR_Cmin_, MR_Cmax_ were calculated. Comparative analyses of MRs across CYP2D6 and ABCB1 SNPs were conducted. Additionally, the CL, as well as the V of ARI and DARI were obtained from PopPK model established in our previous research [[16](#CR16)]. The relationships between CYP2D6/ABCB1 SNPs and PK parameters or clinical efficacy of ARI were summarized in Table [4](#Tab4), the detailed data and procedures could be found in Supplementary Table [S4](#MOESM2) online.

Table 4 Caption: The conclusive relationships between CYP2D6/ABCB1 SNPs or phenotypes and PK/PD of ARI (Table S2-Table S4)

Statistical comparisons of the pharmacokinetic parameters (MR_AUC0−t_, MR_Cmin_, MR_Cmax_, CL, V) across CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs28371725, CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs3892097, CYP2D6 rs5030865, CYP2D6 rs1058164, CYP2D6 rs28371705, CYP2D6 rs28371703, CYP2D6 rs28371702, CYP2D6 rs29001518, CYP2D6 rs1080995, CYP2D6 rs1065852, CYP2D6 rs769258, CYP2D6 rs1080989, CYP2D6 rs1080985), and ABCB1 SNPs (ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582)) were conducted. CYP2D6 rs28371725, CYP2D6 rs3892097, CYP2D6 rs28371703, CYP2D6 rs1080995 and CYP2D6 rs769258 had no significant association with the pharmacokinetic parameters. For CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs5030865, CYP2D6 rs1058164, CYP2D6 rs28371702, CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989, MR_AUC0−t_, MR_Cmin_, MR_Cmax_ were all significantly influenced by these mutations (*P*<0.05). Post-hoc tests revealed that the pairwise comparisons of MR_AUC0−t_ and MR_Cmax_ among the CC, CG, and GG groups for CYP2D6 rs1058164 showed statistically significant differences, while no statistically significant difference was observed in MR_Cmin_ levels between the CC and C/G groups. The CL of ARI, but not DARI, was associated with CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs5030865, and CYP2D6 rs1080989 variants. For CYP2D6 rs1135840, CL of ARI was higher in CC genotype carriers compared to CG and GG carriers, whereas ARI CL was significantly lower in CYP2D6 rs5030865 CT carriers than in CC carriers (*P*<0.05). Similarly, CYP2D6 rs1080989 CT and TT carriers exhibited reduced ARI CL relative to CC carriers, no significant difference was found between CYP2D6 rs1080989 TT and CT individuals. Only three SNPs (CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs29001518, and CYP2D6 rs1080985) demonstrated correlations with CL of DARI. In addition, CYP2D6 polymorphisms had no effect on V of ARI. Among those SNPs, CYP2D6 rs5030865 variant was associated with V of DARI. For ABCB1 variants, V of DARI was influenced by ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642).

### Effect of CYP2D6 and ABCB1 polymorphisms on pharmacodynamics of ARI

HWE test was peformed once again in 56 pharmacodynamic samples, CYP2D6 rs1135822, CYP2D6 rs28371717 and ABCB1 G26777T/A (rs2032582) was not in HWE (*P*<0.05). CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989 was significantly associated with clinical response in this study. For CYP2D6 rs1065852, the CC/CT/TT genotypes were observed in 13/22/21 subjects, respectively, with response rates of 23%, 91%, and 71%. For CYP2D6 rs1080989, the number of CC/CT/TT subjects were 12/26/28, the response rate was 25%/88%/67% respectively. No statistically significant differences in response rates were observed for the remaining 13 CYP2D6 SNPs (CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs28371725, CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs3892097, CYP2D6 rs5030865, CYP2D6 rs1058164, CYP2D6 rs28371705, CYP2D6 rs28371703, CYP2D6 rs28371702, CYP2D6 rs29001518, CYP2D6 rs1080995, CYP2D6 rs769258, CYP2D6 rs1080985). ABCB1 gene variants showed no significant influence on the clinical efficacy of ARI in TD patients. The effect of CYP2D6 SNPs and ABCB1 SNPs on clinical efficacy of ARI was summarized in Table [4](#Tab4), the detailed data and procedures could be found in Supplementary Table [S3](#MOESM3) online.

### Comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical effectiveness between different phenotypes

A total of 15 UMs, 34 NMs, and 35 IMs were identified, as summarized in Table [1](#Tab1). Significant differences in MRs (AUC_0 − t_, C_min_, C_max_) and ARI clearance (CL) were observed across the three groups (*P* < 0.05; Table [4](#Tab4); Fig. [1](#Fig1)a–e), the detailed data and procedures could be found in Supplementary Table [S4](#MOESM4) online. However, no significant differences were found in CL of DARI among three groups. Further comparisons with Bonferroni correction revealed statistically significant differences in MRs and CL of ARI between the UMs and NMs, as well as between the UMs and IMs (*P*<0.0167), but not between the NMs and IMs. Chi-square tests were performed to compare the clinical response rates of ARI at 4th week, 8th week among the three metabolizer groups, the results were shown in Table [5](#Tab5). The results revealed significant differences in response rates at 4th week and 8th week across metabolizer types. Pairwise chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction demonstrated statistically significant differences in clinical response rates between UMs and NMs, as well as between UMs and IMs. These findings suggested that CYP2D6 phenotypes significantly influenced clinical efficacy by modulating the pharmacokinetic process of ARI.

## Discussion

ARI, apart from being described as an antipsychotic drug, is also a mood stabilizer. ARI has emerged as a widely used agent for treating of TD due to its effectiveness and less adverse effects compared to other dopamine-modulating agents such as haloperidol and risperidone [[6](#CR6), [24](#CR24), [25](#CR25)]. Population pharmacokinetic data for ARI in pediatric populations remain limited. The influence of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 variants on aripiprazole metabolism is neglectable as the CL of ARI is mainly carried out by CYP2D6 [[15](#CR15), [26](#CR26)–[28](#CR28)]. Therefore, this study detected the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and ABCB1.

This study elucidated the relationship between CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms and pharmacokinetic parameters, including MR, V and CL in children of TD. MRs of C_max_, C_min_ and AUC_0 − t_, CL of ARI were statistically different between different genotypes of CYP2D6 rs1135840 (*P*<0.05), further intergroup analysis revealed no significant differences between CYP2D6 rs1135840 CG and CYP2D6 rs1135840 GG subjects. In the study of Zhang’s [[14](#CR14)], it revealed that C_max_, T_max_ and AUC_0–∞_ were substantially influenced by CYP2D6 rs1135840. Belmonte et al. [[15](#CR15)] found that MR was influenced by CYP2D6 phenotypes and CYP3A5*3. Only CYP2D6 rs5030865 demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the V of DARI As for V of ARI or DARI. The CYP2D6 SNPs that influenced CL of ARI were: CYP2D6 rs1135840, CYP2D6 rs5030865, CYP2D6 rs1080989, respectively. CYP2D6 rs16947, CYP2D6 rs29001518 and CYP2D6 rs1080985 was significantly associated with CL of DARI. A recent study in Chinese subjects shown that CYP2D6 rs1058164 and CYP2D6 rs28371699 influenced the pharmacokinetics of ARI, such as T_1/2_, and AUC_0−∞_ [[14](#CR14)]. Similarly, variants of CYP2D6 rs1058164 effected MR of AUC_0 − t_ in this research. This study, alongside findings by Jukic et al.’s [[29](#CR29)] strongly supported that CYP2D6 genetic testing would be an important and necessary means in the clinical treatment process. Comparisions with previous researches were shown in Supplementary Table [S5](#MOESM5) online.

CYP2D6 metabolizer status strongly influences the metabolism of aripiprazole, leading to changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, including exposure as defined by the AUC, half-life, CL, and steady-state concentration [[30](#CR30)]. This study investigated the differences of MRs(MR_AUC_, MR_Cmin_, MR_Cmax_), CL of ARI and DARI among CYP2D6 phenotypes. The results demonstrated that CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms significantly influenced both the CL of ARI and MRs of AUC, MR_Cmin_, MR_Cmax_ in children with TD, whereas no statistically significant differences in CL of DARI were observed in UMs, IMs and NMs. This finding indicated that CYP2D6 polymorphisms primarily affect the metabolism of ARI rather than the elimination of its dehydrogenated metabolite DARI. Post hoc analysis revealed that these significant differences were specifically manifested between UMs and NMs, as well as UMs and IMs. No statistically significant difference was found between NM and IM groups. UMs (carrying more active alleles) exhibited significantly higher MRs (AUC_0 − t,_ C_max_, C_min_) than IMs. Accordingly, UMs may need higher doses to achieve therapeutic responses [[31](#CR31)]. However, dose titration should consider the clinical judgment and therapeutic drug monitoring. The relationships between CYP2D6 metabolic status and pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that this information may be helpful for dosing and titration decisions in pediatric populations.

ABCB1 plays a role in processes of drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. ARI and DARI are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which is encoded by ABCB1 gene [[32](#CR32)]. ABCB1 C3545T (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582) were reported to alter the expression and activity of P-gp that in turn was found associated with an alteration of absorption and distribution of ARI [[33](#CR33)]. In a study conducted by Belmonte et al. [[15](#CR15)], 148 healthy adult volunteers aged 18–55 years were enrolled to investigate the effects of ABCB1 polymorphisms on the metabolism of ARI. The study found that ABCB1 C1236T (rs1128503) and ABCB1 G2677T/A (rs2032582) polymorphisms affected CL of ARI. While no correlation was found between CL of ARI or DARI and variants of ABCB1 G2677T/A (rs2032582) and ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) in this research. Carrying ABCB1 C3435T T allele showed greater AUC than CC homozygotes was proposed in Koller et al.’s report [[34](#CR34)]. T allele carriers for G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphisms had significantly lower plasma concentration/dose ratio (C/D) for ARI related to patients with other ABCB1 genotypes in Rafaniello et al.’s report [[27](#CR27)]. In this study, there was significantly difference in V of DARI in ABCB1 C3435T (rs1045642) TT and CT subjects, CT and CC subjects with multiple post hoc comparisons, while ABCB1 polymorphisms showed no effect on MR_AUC0−t_, MR_Cmin_, as well as MR_Cmax_. The greater influence of ABCB1 C3545T (rs1045642) on V of the DARI than parent drug could be attributed to the higher affinity of metabolite DARI to P-gp [[35](#CR35)]. In conclusion, the polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene exert limited effects on ARI metabolism in pediatric populations. The P-gp transporter is highly expressed in brain tissue, and the immature development of the blood-brain barrier in children attenuates the impact of ABCB1 genetic variations on ARI distribution [[36](#CR36), [37](#CR37)]. As P-gp expression gradually increases throughout childhood development, this phenomenon partially explains the observed discrepancies between findings of adults and children. To date, studies investigating ABCB1 polymorphisms and ARI pharmacokinetics have yielded inconsistent results, warranting further investigation. Comparisons with previous researches were shown in Table [S5](#MOESM5).

This research also analyzed the correlation between CYP2D6 and ABCB1 SNPs and therapeutic response which was rare in previous studies. Associations between CYP2D6 polymorphisms and clinical efficacy or safety have yielded conflicting results. Only few clinical studies showed a significant relationship between CYP2D6 genotype and symptom response [[38](#CR38), [39](#CR39)]. Regarding DRD2/ ANKK1 gene polymorphisms—C957T polymorphism, schizophrenic patients with CC genotype were associated with poor ARI response for excitement symptoms when compared with TT patients [[40](#CR40)]. Yan et al. concluded that genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 rs1065852, CYP2D6 rs1799732, CYP2D6 rs1800497 and their interactions affected the clinical efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia [[41](#CR41)]. It was also reported that ABCB1 G2677T/A (rs2032582) influenced the clinical response to antipsychotics like risperidone and haloperidol [[42](#CR42)]. However, these studies focused on schizophrenia, differing from TD pediatrics treated with ARI. Therapeutic efficacy post-ARI treatment varied significantly based on CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989 genotypes. As shown above, both CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989 variants influenced MRs of C_max_, C_min_ and AUC_0 − t_. Moreover, ABCB1 gene polymorphism was not associated with therapeutic effects in this study. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in clinical response rates were observed among different CYP2D6 phenotypes at both 4th and 8th week of ARI treatment. UMs exhibited significantly lower response rates than NMs and IMs. These findings suggested that clinical implementation of CYP2D6 genotyping is warranted in pediatric populations, particularly focusing on the two polymorphisms (CYP2D6 rs1065852, CYP2D6 rs1080989). However, there were challenges in interpreting the above outcomes: the statistical power of correlational analysis is limited, which cannot adequately adjust for potential confounding factors influencing therapeutic outcomes, such as comorbidities, concomitant medications, TD severity, and the presence of phonic tics. Due to the limited sample size and covariates, adjusted regression models were not feasible for this study. The conclusions derived from this study necessitate further validation and clinical evidence with higher sample sizes and containing confounding factors analysis. Furthermore, given the unique characteristics of the pediatric developmental populations—including ethical constraints surrounding genetic testing, the invasive nature of blood sampling in children, and the lack of sufficient evidence-based data—CYP2D6 genotyping remains investigational in pediatric TD due to ethical, logistical, and evidence gaps. Based on findings from prior studies [[17](#CR17)], we recommend prioritizing CYP2D6 genotyping for pediatric TD patients with high serum concentration in clinical practice but still not ideal treatment effect and clinically severe conditions, contingent upon parental consent, to guide clinical dose adjustments.

### Limitations

(1) The modest sample size and limited covariates inherently limited the statistical power of this study. (2) YGTSS score is somewhat subjective during treatment response observation, with rater bias and recall bias. (3) Comparisons with prior studies were challenging due to the scarcity of comparable pharmacogenetic evidence in pediatric TD populations. (4) The clinical integration of pharmacogenomic testing for pediatric TD management faces practical barriers, including ethical concerns, the invasiveness of genetic sampling in children, and insufficient evidence-based guidelines.

To our knowledge, this represents the first study to systematically investigate the relationships between CYP2D6, ABCB1 SNPs, pharmacokinetic parameters, and clinical response to ARI in pediatric TD. Different from previous studies, ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were not prominently influenced pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical response in TD patients. CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms were associated with pharmacokinetic parameters of ARI such as MRs and CL. CYP2D6 rs1065852 and CYP2D6 rs1080989 demonstrated partial correlations with clinical response rates. Therefore, CYPD6 genotype testing should be integrated with clinical factors such as sex, liver and renal functions and concomitant medications during clinical therapeutic drug monitoring and treatment. Although significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the different genotypes could be observed, further comprehensive studies incorporating pharmacokinetic interactions, environmental variables, and clinical covariates are required. Despite these limitations of our study, CYP2D6 genetic testing is still recommended to comprehend these pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic, pharmacodynamic interactions during treatment of ARI in pediatric clinics.
