## Abstract

Nevirapine is metabolized by several hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms to generate four primary hydroxylated metabolites: 2-hydroxynevirapine, 3-hydroxynevirapine, 8-hydroxynevirapine, and 12-hydroxynevirapine. The present study characterized associations between genetic polymorphisms and metabolite ratios in HIV-infected Cambodians. We demonstrate associations between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and metabolite ratios for both 3-hydroxynevirapine and 8-hydroxynevirapine, suggesting involvement of CYP2B6 in generating these metabolites.

## TEXT

In resource-limited settings, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine (NVP) is among the World Health Organization-recommended alternative first-line regimens for HIV-1 infection, in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Nevirapine is also recommended as a component of alternative first-line therapy for HIV-infected pregnant or breastfeeding women and for patients being treated for coinfection with HIV-1 and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* ([1](#B1)).

There is considerable interindividual variability with regard to nevirapine efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Its long plasma half-life after single-dose administration decreases after multiple doses due to auto-induction of hepatic metabolism ([2](#B2)). Nevirapine is approximately 60% bound to plasma proteins, with elimination mainly through oxidative metabolism. Genetic polymorphisms are associated with slower NVP clearance ([3](#B3)[–](#B4)[5](#B5)).

Metabolism of NVP by several hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms generates four primary hydroxylated metabolites: 2-hydroxynevirapine (2OH-NVP), 3-hydroxynevirapine (3OH-NVP), 8-hydroxynevirapine (8OH-NVP), and 12-hydroxynevirapine (12OH-NVP) ([2](#B2)). Further metabolism of 12OH-NVP generates 4-carboxynevirapine ([6](#B6)). Studies using *in vitro* microsomes suggest that the involved isoforms are CYP3A4 for 2OH-NVP, CYP2B6 for 3OH-NVP ([7](#B7)), CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for 8OH-NVP, and CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for 12OH-NVP ([8](#B8)[–](#B9)[10](#B10)).

Nevirapine causes life-threatening hepatotoxicity and a skin rash in some individuals. Risk variants for nevirapine toxicity include *HLA* types with hepatotoxicity and both *HLA* types and *CYP2B6* 516G→T (rs3745274) with skin rash ([11](#B11)). While the molecular basis underlying NVP toxicities is incompletely understood, previous studies suggest that NVP metabolites may be involved ([12](#B12), [13](#B13)).

Previously, an open-label, single-center, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study (ANRS12154, also called PECAN) enrolled HIV-infected Cambodians from the ESTHER (Ensemble pour une Solidarité Thérapeutique Hospitalière en Réseau) cohort at Calmette Hospital, Phnom Penh. All participants received NVP 200 mg twice daily plus two nucleoside analogs. Participants provided written informed consent for genetic testing. The National Ethics Committee of Cambodia approved the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analyses.

Predose concentrations of NVP, 2OH-NVP, 3OH-NVP, 8OH-NVP, and 12OH-NVP were assayed at 36 months of therapy. Nevirapine was assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and metabolites by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) (limits of quantification, 1 ng/ml) using validated assays as described elsewhere ([14](#B14)). For determinations below the limits of quantification, reported results were used.

DNA was extracted from whole blood using the QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genotyping for *ABCB1*, *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, and *NR1I2* polymorphisms was performed as previously described ([15](#B15)).

Previous analyses based on ANRS12154-characterized steady-state nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected Cambodians ([5](#B5)) identified associations between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms (rs3745274, rs7251950, and rs2279343) and slower plasma NVP clearance ([5](#B5), [15](#B15)), and in a subset of 10 participants the analyses described full pharmacokinetic profiles of NVP metabolites ([6](#B6)). The present study quantified metabolite ratios at steady state (defined as the ratio of each metabolite to nevirapine concentration at 12 h) in the entire cohort and genetic associations with these ratios.

Statistical analyses were performed as described elsewhere ([15](#B15)) but using metabolite ratios as the phenotype.

Of 129 ESTHER cohort participants included in a previous report ([15](#B15)), the present analysis included 127 (98.5%) who were successfully genotyped and had metabolite ratios. At baseline, median age was 36.5 years (range 21 to 59 years), median weight was 56 kg (range 39 to 82 kg), and 53 (41.7%) were women. Self-reported adherence based on a visual analog scale was high at both month 18 and month 36 in over 98% of participants ([5](#B5)).

Of 508 metabolite determinations, 28 (5.5%) were below the limit of quantification, all for 2OH-NVP. Plasma metabolite concentrations were much lower than plasma NVP concentrations. The trough concentration medians (and ranges) were as follows: for NVP 6,017 ng/ml (1,800 to 15,422 ng/ml), for 2OH-NVP 1.9 ng/ml (0.5 to 16.5 ng/ml), for 3OH-NVP 39.8 ng/ml (7.9 to 88.2 ng/ml), for 8OH-NVP 15.7 ng/ml (3.4 to 31.6 ng/ml), and for 12OH-NVP 222.1 ng/ml (41.7 to 657.4 ng/ml). Metabolite ratios varied considerably by metabolite, with wide ranges ([Fig. 1](#F1)). The median metabolite ratios (and ranges) were as follows: for 2OH-NVP 0.03% (< 0.01 to 0.22%), for 3OH-NVP 0.69% (0.13 to 2.00%), for 8OH-NVP 0.26% (0.06 to 0.77%), and for 12OH-NVP 3.60% (0.72 to 21.80%).

Box plots of metabolite ratios for 2-hydroxynevirapine (2OH-NVP), 3-hydroxynevirapine (3OH-NVP), 8-hydroxynevirapine (8OH-NVP), and 12-hydroxynevirapine (12OH-NVP) in 127 HIV-infected Cambodians. Bond lines indicate medians, boxes represent interquartile ranges, dashed lines represent 95% confidence interval, and circles represent outliers. Note that the y axis is in log-scale.

Of 197 assayed loci, 130 (66.0%) were polymorphic, all of which were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on a Bonferroni-adjusted *P* value threshold of 0.0004. Polymorphisms with nominal Hardy-Weinberg *P* values less than 0.05 were *CYP2B6* rs28399433 (*P* = 0.006), *CYP2B6* rs152222 (*P* = 0.004), and *ABCB1* rs1978095 (*P* = 0.02).

In univariate analyses, *CYP2B6* 516G→T (rs3745274) and 6 other *CYP2B6* polymorphisms were associated with the 3OH-NVP metabolite ratio (lowest *P* = 1.9 × 10^−4^), while *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 9 other *CYP2B6* polymorphisms were associated with the 8OH-NVP metabolite ratio (lowest *P* = 4.1 × 10^−5^). 3OH-NVP and 8OH-NVP metabolite ratios stratified by *CYP2B6* rs3745274 genotype are shown in [Fig. 2](#F2). After adjusting for rs3745274, no other single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was found associated with the 3OH-NVP or 8OH-NVP metabolite ratio. No SNP was associated with the 2OH-NVP or 12OH-NVP metabolite ratio, including *CYP3A5* 6986A→G (rs776746).

Box plots of metabolite ratios for 3OH-NVP (a) and 8OH-NVP (b) stratified by CYP2B6 516G→T (rs3745274) genotype. MR, metabolite ratio; n, number of participants.

The *CYP2B6*6* haplotype defined by rs3745274 T, and in a linkage disequilibrium block of 24 polymorphisms, was associated with the 3OH-NVP and 8OH-NVP metabolite ratios (*P* = 1.1 × 10^−3^ and *P* = 1.2 × 10^−4^, respectively). No other haplotype was associated with any metabolite ratio.

This study shows that among HIV-infected Cambodians, *CYP2B6* polymorphisms that predict slower plasma NVP clearance also affect the plasma profiles of 3OH-NVP and 8OH-NVP, suggesting involvement of CYP2B6 in generating both metabolites. While *in vitro* studies indicate that CYP2B6 is involved in generating 3OH-NVP, CYP2B6 was not previously suspected to be involved in generating 8OH-NVP. In a previous study comparing plasma NVP metabolite concentrations, 8OH-NVP was detected only at steady state, not after a single dose, suggesting that enzyme induction may be required to generate 8OH-NVP ([6](#B6)). As CYP2B6 is inducible ([16](#B16), [17](#B17)), our results are consistent with this hypothesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implicate CYP2B6 in generating 8OH-NVP. Moreover, there was no association between the 2OH-NVP metabolite ratio and *CYP3A* polymorphisms, despite CYP3A being involved in generating 2OH-NVP and *CYP3A5* polymorphisms that are frequent in Cambodians. These results provide novel insight into the genetics of NVP metabolism.
