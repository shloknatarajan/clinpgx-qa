## Abstract

Rationale: Combination lumacaftor/ivacaftor has been shown to improve lung function and other endpoints in patients aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis and homozygous for F508del-CFTR, but it has not been assessed in younger patients.

Objectives: In this open-label phase III trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy in patients aged 6–11 years with cystic fibrosis who were homozygous for F508del-CFTR.

Methods: Patients (N = 58) received 200 mg lumacaftor/250 mg ivacaftor orally every 12 hours for 24 weeks in addition to their existing cystic fibrosis medications.

Measurements and Main Results: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was well tolerated; the safety profile was generally similar to that observed in larger lumacaftor/ivacaftor trials with older patients. Four patients discontinued (two because of drug-related adverse events: elevated liver transaminases, n = 1; rash, n = 1). No safety concerns were associated with spirometry. No significant changes in percent predicted FEV1 were observed (change from baseline at Week 24, +2.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.2 to 5.2; P = 0.0671). At Week 24, significant improvements from baseline were observed in sweat chloride (−24.8 mmol/L; 95% CI, −29.1 to −20.5; P < 0.0001), body mass index z score (+0.15; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.22; P < 0.0001), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score (+5.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 9.4; P = 0.0085), and lung clearance index based on lung volume turnover required to reach 2.5% of starting N2 concentration (−0.88; 95% CI, −1.40 to −0.37; P = 0.0018).

Conclusions: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was well tolerated in this young population; no new safety concerns were identified. Improvements in lung clearance index, sweat chloride, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life were observed after 24 weeks of treatment.

### Scientific Knowledge on the Subject

In two phase III clinical trials, combination therapy with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators lumacaftor and ivacaftor improved lung function and other endpoints in patients aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were homozygous for the *F508del-CFTR* mutation. The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been evaluated in younger patients.

### What This Study Adds to the Field

In this open-label phase III study of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6–11 years who were homozygous for the *F508del-CFTR* mutation, the combination therapy was well tolerated over 24 weeks of treatment, with a safety profile similar to that observed in older patients. Sweat chloride rapidly improved after treatment initiation and returned to baseline once therapy was discontinued. Though significant improvements in percent predicted FEV_1_ were not observed in this young population with relatively preserved spirometric measures of lung function, the lung clearance index, a lung function measure sensitive to early CF lung disease, did improve significantly, as did body mass index *z* score and quality-of-life measures. These results provide evidence for the safety of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in a younger age group.

## Methods

### Study Oversight

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an institutional review board at each participating site before initiation of the study. Patient caregivers provided written consent, and, where applicable, patients provided written assent.

### Study Participants

Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were 6–11 years of age at screening, had a confirmed diagnosis of CF ([21](#bib21)), were homozygous for the *F508del-CFTR* mutation, had a percent predicted FEV_1_ greater than or equal to 40 ([22](#bib22)), and had stable CF disease as deemed by the investigator at the screening visit. Patients with abnormalities in hemoglobin levels, liver function, or renal function were excluded. All enrolled patients were assigned to receive lumacaftor at a dose of 200 mg and ivacaftor at a dose of 250 mg every 12 hours for 24 weeks. This dosage regimen was selected on the basis of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data from part A of this study ([20](#bib20)). Physicians recommended patients maintain their prestudy medications per the study protocol. Further information regarding eligibility is provided in the online supplement.

### Endpoints

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy as assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events, clinical laboratory values, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, pulse oximetry, ophthalmologic examinations, and spirometry (including percent predicted FEV_1_). Safety parameters were evaluated at screening, follow-up visits during the 24-week treatment period, and 2 weeks after the end of treatment at Week 26. Secondary endpoints included average absolute changes from baseline in sweat chloride at Day 15 and Week 4; absolute change from baseline in BMI, weight, height, and respective *z* scores (*see* online supplement for description of *z*-score calculations) at Week 24 ([23](#bib23)); absolute change from baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score ([24](#bib24)) at Week 24; and absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 to Week 26. Lung clearance index (lung volume turnover required to reach 2.5% of starting N_2_ concentration [LCI_2.5_]) ([25](#bib25)) was assessed as an exploratory endpoint in a subset of patients attending centers with expertise in the methodology. Further information about study assessments is available in the online supplement.

### Statistical Analyses

The target enrollment of 56 patients was determined on the basis of power calculations for the primary safety endpoint of adverse event incidence, details of which are available in the online supplement. Data were summarized descriptively using mean, SD, SEM, and 95% confidence interval (CI) data. Absolute changes from baseline were evaluated using mixed-effects models for repeated measures, as detailed in the online supplement. Comparisons between Week 24 on-treatment visits and Week 26 safety follow-up visits for percent predicted FEV_1_ and sweat chloride were performed using linear regression models, as detailed in the online supplement. A *P* value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

## Results

### Participants

A total of 58 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 54 completed 24 weeks of treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Two patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events (see Safety subsection below), one withdrew, and one did not meet eligibility criteria ([Figure 1](#fig1)). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in [Table 1](#tbl1). The study population was well balanced for sex and had generally well-preserved lung function (mean percent predicted FEV_1_ [SD], 91.4 [13.7]) and nutritional status (mean BMI-for-age *z* score [SD], 0.01 [0.90]). Thirty patients were enrolled in, and 27 completed, the LCI_2.5_ substudy. Mean baseline LCI_2.5_ (SD) was 9.99 (2.67), which is substantially higher than the mean (SD) of 7.2 (0.5) reported in healthy children ([26](#bib26)). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of this group are shown in Table E1 in the online supplement.

### Safety

Adverse events were reported in 94.8% of patients ([Table 2](#tbl2)). Two patients discontinued treatment with study drug because of adverse events: one patient because of elevated liver transaminases and one because of rash. In both of these patients, the adverse events were considered related to the study drug and resolved following discontinuation of study drug. No deaths were reported. The most commonly reported adverse events were cough, nasal congestion, infective pulmonary exacerbation, and headache. The majority of patients experienced adverse events of mild or moderate severity. Four patients (6.9%) experienced severe adverse events (ileus, n = 1; sunburn, n = 1; viral gastroenteritis, n = 1; headache, n = 1), none of which were considered related to study drug. Four patients (6.9%) experienced serious adverse events (infective pulmonary exacerbation, n = 2; ileus, n = 1, elevated liver transaminases, n = 1). Study drug was temporarily interrupted for two of the serious adverse events (ileus, 2 d; elevated liver transaminases, 26 d) until they resolved. One patient developed cataracts of mild severity by Week 24 of the study.

Table 2 Caption: Adverse Events

Predefined respiratory adverse events of special interest were reported in four patients (dyspnea, n = 1; abnormal respiration, n = 1; wheezing, n = 2). These events were all nonserious and mild in severity, and in three patients they resolved without interruption of study drug. Wheezing was not resolved in one patient but was not considered related to study drug, and study drug was not interrupted. Onset of respiratory events was after Week 4, except for the patient with abnormal respiration (onset Day 1, resolved after 1 d).

Liver function testing was performed at Days 1 and 15 and every 4 weeks starting from Week 4. Elevated liver enzymes considered clinically significant were reported as adverse events. A total of 11 patients (19.3%) had alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at any time during the study period, 5 (8.8%) had alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase elevations greater than five times the ULN, 3 (5.3%) had alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase elevations greater than eight times the ULN, and no patients had elevated bilirubin; patients with multiple elevation events were counted once per enzyme. [Table 3](#tbl3) shows the proportion of patients with liver function test elevations during the study period by elevation category. Study drug treatment was interrupted for two patients because of elevated transaminases, and for a third patient, treatment was interrupted because of elevated transaminases, resumed following recovery, and then permanently discontinued after subsequent transaminase elevation.

A mean increase from baseline in systolic blood pressure was observed at Week 24 of the study (3.0 mm Hg; SE, 1.4), and mean diastolic blood pressure was also increased from baseline at Week 24 (0.8 mm Hg; SE, 1.1). No adverse events associated with increased blood pressure were reported.

Summary data for percent predicted FEV_1_ measures are shown in [Figure 2](#fig2). No safety concerns associated with these measures were observed. There were no significant changes detected in percent predicted FEV_1_ ([Table 4](#tbl4)) during the treatment period. Summary data for other spirometric measures are shown in Table E2. A significant drop in percent predicted FEV_1_ was observed between the final on-treatment visit at Week 24 and the Week 26 follow-up visit (least squares [LS] mean change, −3.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.8 to −1.6; *P* = 0.0003).

### Pharmacodynamic and Efficacy Endpoints

Summary data for sweat chloride tests are shown in [Figure 3](#fig3). A substantial and significant average decrease from baseline in sweat chloride concentration was observed at Day 15 and Week 4 (average from both time points, LS mean change, −19.7 mmol/L; 95% CI, −23.2 to −16.3; *P* < 0.0001). Significant decreases were also observed at Week 24 (LS mean change, −24.8 mmol/L; 95% CI, −29.1 to −20.5; *P* < 0.0001) and the other study visits at which sweat chloride was measured ([Table 4](#tbl4)). At Week 24, 41 of 51 patients with measurements showed a decrease from baseline greater than 15 mmol/L (Figure E1). The LS mean absolute change from Week 24 to the Week 26 follow-up visit was 21.3 mmol/L (95% CI, 18.6 to 24.0; *P* < 0.0001), representing a return to baseline in this measure 2 weeks after ending lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy.

Decrease in sweat chloride indicates improvement. CI = confidence interval.

Summary data for recorded BMI and BMI-for-age *z* scores are shown in [Figures 4A and 4B](#fig4). Significant increases in BMI from baseline were observed at Week 4 (LS mean change, 0.12 kg/m^2^; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23; *P* = 0.0197) and subsequent study visits ([Table 4](#tbl4)). We also observed significant increases from baseline in BMI *z* scores at the same visits ([Table 4](#tbl4)). At the Week 26 follow-up visit, BMI and BMI *z* scores remained above baseline ([Figures 4A and 4B](#fig4)). Significant increases from baseline were also observed at treatment visits from Day 15 onward for weight and from Week 4 onward for weight *z* score and height (*see* Table E3). Increased height, weight, and weight *z* scores were maintained at the Week 26 follow-up visit. No significant increases from baseline in height *z* scores were observed at any study visit.

## Discussion

Combination therapy with lumacaftor, a CFTR corrector, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, was well tolerated in patients with CF aged 6–11 years who were homozygous for the *F508del-CFTR* mutation, and improvements were demonstrated in sweat chloride; measures of nutritional status; the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R; and LCI_2.5_, a sensitive measure of early CF lung disease.

While an open-label study has limitations in accurately quantifying the frequency of drug-related adverse events, the safety profile was similar to that seen in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 12 years or older ([19](#bib19)). Increases in blood pressure observed in the present study were consistent with those reported in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, and there were no associated adverse events. The rate of abnormal liver function tests was higher in patients in the present study than in older patients in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, but it was generally consistent with elevations seen in placebo-treated patients from the same age group in previous ivacaftor monotherapy trials ([12](#bib12)). In TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, respiratory adverse events occurred mainly at the initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy and, in some cases, necessitated interruption or discontinuation of treatment ([19](#bib19)). In the present study, respiratory events were observed less frequently; were not associated with drug interruption or discontinuation; and, with one exception, time of onset was more than 28 days after treatment initiation. Respiratory events were all mild in severity and resolved before the end of the study with continued lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy, except for one patient in whom wheezing (judged not related to study drug) continued throughout the study. Two patients experienced adverse events that required drug discontinuation (rash and elevated liver transaminases), and these events resolved after drug discontinuation.

Baseline lung function in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT patients was lower than for patients in the present study (mean percent predicted FEV_1_ ranged from 60.4 to 60.8 for different treatment arms in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT vs. 91.4 in the present study) ([19](#bib19)), an expected finding, given the progressive nature of airway disease with age in CF ([27](#bib27)). Our study was not powered to detect significant changes in spirometric measures, because these changes were planned as safety endpoints. Further, there is limited ability to improve percent predicted FEV_1_ in patients with well-preserved lung function. The smaller sample size and milder lung disease in the present study population may explain the lack of a significant effect of study drug on percent predicted FEV_1_.

Baseline sweat chloride levels in this study population were high (mean, 105.9 mmol/L), typical for *F508del-CFTR* homozygotes ([28](#bib28)). We saw a rapid decrease in sweat chloride after initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in the study population, which persisted while treatment was maintained, indicating that combination therapy increased CFTR activity in these patients. This finding is further supported by the rapid and near-complete reversion to baseline sweat chloride levels after the 2-week post-treatment washout period. Although almost all individual patients showed improvements in sweat chloride in the present study, these improvements were not as robust as those seen in similarly aged patients with the gating mutation *G551D* who received ivacaftor (>50 mmol/L) ([12](#bib12)). This finding was to be expected, given that the *F508del*-mutant CFTR channels have reduced membrane delivery in addition to gating deficits, and is in line with *in vitro* findings, suggesting that lumacaftor only partially rescues the processing defect in *F508del*-mutant CFTR proteins ([10](#bib10)).

We observed significant improvement in nutritional parameters over the course of 24 weeks of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Though mean BMI-for-age *z* score at baseline was in the normal range for our study population, it improved during treatment, beginning as early as 4 weeks following the initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Maintaining and improving nutritional status is an important consideration in CF because patients in the normal range for nutritional measures have better lung function and survival outcomes ([29](#bib29)).

The CFQ-R is a reliable and validated instrument for the assessment of patient-reported quality of life in CF, including for pediatric patients ([30](#bib30)). We found that, from Week 8 onward, mean respiratory domain scores improved more than the minimal clinically important difference in CF patient populations aged 6 years and above (4 points; determined by analysis of two open-label studies of inhaled tobramycin use in patients with CF) ([31](#bib31)).

In our patient population we noted fairly normal baseline percent predicted FEV_1_ values but abnormal baseline LCI_2.5_ values. This has been noted in previous studies in children with CF and has been taken as evidence of small airway disease that is amenable to assessment by LCI but falls below the limits of detection of standard spirometry. In CF, as a consequence of heterogeneous obstruction of small airways caused by mucus plugging, the distribution of ventilation is significantly affected, and this has an important effect on multiple-breath washout test indices such as the LCI ([32](#bib32)). The sensitivity of LCI to small airway disease has been further validated by studies demonstrating better agreement of LCI with high-resolution computed tomography findings, as opposed to spirometry ([33](#bib33)). In addition, LCI values early in life have been shown to predict future pulmonary function abnormalities ([34](#bib34)). LCI has been recommended for use in trials involving young patients with CF and patients with early or mild lung disease ([35](#bib35)), and it has been used to demonstrate the efficacy of ivacaftor alone in patients with at least one *G551D* mutant allele and well-preserved lung function ([36](#bib36)). Although we found no significant improvement in percent predicted FEV_1_, we did detect significant improvements in LCI_2.5_ at all on-treatment visits versus baseline. Although a minimal clinically important difference is yet to be established for this measure, it has been recommended that to be considered clinically significant, treatment effects should be larger than coefficients of reliability for replicate measurements ([35](#bib35)). The mean improvement in LCI_2.5_ observed at the Week 4 visit in the present study (a reduction from baseline of 1.08) was above previously reported coefficients of reliability in patients with CF in this age group undergoing N_2_-based LCI_2.5_ testing (intratest coefficient of reliability, 1.00; intertest, 0.96) ([37](#bib37)). Further, this level of improvement is comparable to the magnitude of effect reported in previous trials assessing the effect on LCI_2.5_ of drugs known to be efficacious in CF ([38](#bib38), [39](#bib39)). The noted effects on LCI merit further investigation through larger randomized trials of longer duration to assess the magnitude of effect compared with a control group, as well as to evaluate for the sustainability of any effects with prolonged exposure. Such studies would also provide additional information on the relevance of changes in LCI in relation to other clinical outcomes.

In conclusion, in this study, combination therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor was generally well tolerated in patients aged 6–11 years with CF who were homozygous for the *F508del-CFTR* mutation, with a safety profile consistent with those in previous studies of adolescent and adult patients with this mutation. Respiratory events were observed with lower frequency than in older patients, were not temporally related to treatment initiation in most cases, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation in any patients. Even though we did not observe significant improvement in percent predicted FEV_1_ in this young population with relatively well-preserved spirometric measures of lung function, we did detect significant improvement in the LCI in a subset of patients, suggesting that it may be a more sensitive measure with which to evaluate a treatment effect in a young population with normal to near-normal spirometric measures. Sweat chloride determinations supported a marked increase in CFTR activity while patients were receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and improved BMI was also observed. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy positively impacted the respiratory domain of patients’ self-reported quality of life. Although a limitation of our study is its open-label design, the rapid onset of detectable responses in sweat chloride as a surrogate of CFTR function, as well as the magnitude of the individual responses observed (Figure E1), along with a return to baseline values after the end of therapy, give confidence in the conclusion that these effects were study drug related. Special emphasis must be placed on the persistence of improved LCI_2.5_ after the end of treatment. Given the relatively large cross-sectional area offered by the small airways, this persistence could be due to a potential need for a longer latency period before significant and sufficient peripheral airway obstruction recurs and noticeable detrimental changes are detected. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the safety profile of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in patients aged 6–11 years with CF who are homozygous for the *F508del-CFTR* mutation.
