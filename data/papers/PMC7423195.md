## Abstract

**Aims:** 
The current study investigates whether or not functional polymorphisms in the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene ABCG2 might affect gefitinib activity and/or toxicity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

**Materials & methods:** 
Towards this end, ABCG2 polymorphisms and expression were assessed in DNA and tumors from 94 NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib, whereas their associations with toxicity/response and time-to-progression/overall survival were evaluated using Pearson-χ2 and log-rank-test, respectively.

**Results:** 
Patients carrying an ABCG2 −15622T/T genotype or harboring at least one TT copy in the ABCG2 (1143C/T, −15622C/T) haplotype developed significantly more grade 2/3 diarrhea (p < 0.01). No associations were found between polymorphisms and outcome. Consistently, ABCG2 protein levels in tumors were not significantly different between patients harboring different ABCG2 variants.

**Conclusion:** 
The ABCG2 −15622C/T polymorphism and ABCG2 (1143C/T, −15622C/T) haplotype resulted in a gefitinib-dependent, moderate-to-severe diarrhea suggesting that these pharmacogenetic markers should be considered to optimize NSCLC treatment.

### Aims:

The current study investigates whether or not functional polymorphisms in the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene *ABCG2* might affect gefitinib activity and/or toxicity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

### Materials & methods:

Towards this end, *ABCG2* polymorphisms and expression were assessed in DNA and tumors from 94 NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib, whereas their associations with toxicity/response and time-to-progression/overall survival were evaluated using Pearson-χ^2^ and log-rank-test, respectively.

### Results:

Patients carrying an *ABCG2* −15622T/T genotype or harboring at least one TT copy in the *ABCG2* (1143C/T, −15622C/T) haplotype developed significantly more grade 2/3 diarrhea (p < 0.01). No associations were found between polymorphisms and outcome. Consistently, ABCG2 protein levels in tumors were not significantly different between patients harboring different *ABCG2* variants.

### Conclusion:

The *ABCG2* −15622C/T polymorphism and *ABCG2* (1143C/T, −15622C/T) haplotype resulted in a gefitinib-dependent, moderate-to-severe diarrhea suggesting that these pharmacogenetic markers should be considered to optimize NSCLC treatment.

## Materials & methods

### Patients

A total of 49 and 45 NSCLC patients were treated within the expanded access program of gefitinib at Humanitas Clinical Institute (Rozzano, Milan, Italy) and Livorno Civil Hospital (Livorno, Italy), respectively. Patients were enrolled between November 2005 and January 2008. **The selection was based on diag**nosis of histologically confirmed NSCLC with measurable, locally advanced or metastatic disease, progressing/relapsing after chemotherapy, or with contraindications for chemotherapy. The clinical trial and the study on patients’ specimens was approved by the ethics committees ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://Clinicaltrials.gov) ID-[NCT00831454](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00831454) [101]) and conducted in accordance with principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients received oral gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg/day and were evaluated for response after 2 months according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Tumor response was assessed by CT scan, with a confirmatory evaluation repeated in patients with complete/partial response and stable disease at least 4 weeks after the initial determination of response. Toxicities were assessed using the NCI common terminology criteria (Common toxicity criteria manual version 3.0, available from [102]).

### DNA isolation

DNA was isolated from blood or paraffin-embedded tumor samples using the microDNA-kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA yields and integrity were checked at 260–280 nm with NanoDrop® 1000 Detector (NanoDrop Technologies, NC, USA).

### Analysis of polymorphisms

The *ABCG2* 421C/A (dbSNP ID: rs2231142), 1143C/T (dbSNP ID: rs2622604) and −15622C/T polymorphisms were studied with Taqman® (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) probes-based assays using the Applied Biosystems PRISM® 7500HT instrument equipped with the Sequence Detection System version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Specific primers and probe (Applied Biosystems SNP Genotyping Assays products) for the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism were obtained from Applied Biosystems (C __15854163_70, TaqMan Drug Metabolism Genotyping Assays), while primers and probes for *ABCG2* 1143C/T and −15622C/T were designed using the FileBuilder 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems), on the basis of the gene sequence from GenBank: 1143C/T (foward): 5′-CTC TGA AAG CAC TGT TTT GTA AAG AAT ATCA A-3′; (reverse): 5′-GAG GAT CTT ACA GCT CTC TTA TCA TTT GAA-3′; (probe): 5′-ACT ACT CTG G[T/G] GTA TTT-3′ and −15622 C/T (for-ward): 5′-GAA ACC CTG TCT GTC TCT ACT AAA ATT ACA-3′; (reverse): 5′-CCT CCA AAG GAC ATG AAC TCA TTC TTT-3′; (probe): 5′-CAG ACA TGC[A/G] CCA CCA-3′, for the FAM/VIC-fluorescent reporter, respectively. The PCR reactions were performed using 20 ng of genomic DNA diluted in 5.94 μl DNAse-RNAse free water, with 6.25 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and 0.31 μl of the assay mix, including the primers and probes in concentrations optimized in preliminary reactions, in a total volume of 12.5 μl. After thermal cycling, the 7500HT instrument determined the allelic content of each sample in the plate by reading the generated fluorescence [[8](#R8)].

### Tissue microarray construction

A tissue microarray was constructed as previously described [[24](#R24)]. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens of 49 patients (Rozzano, Milan, Italy) were collected, and a pathologist selected areas for 1-mm^2^ punches from tumor cores, tumor borders and normal tissue to include in recipient tissue array block using a specific instrument (Beecher Instruments, WI, USA).

### Immunohistochemistry

Tissue microarray sections were deparaffinized using xylene and rehydrated in alcohol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubating the tissue slides in methanol/0.3% H_2_O_2_ for 30 min. Antigen retrieval was carried out by boiling (microwave) the sections in 0.01 M of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min. After 15 min cooling at room temperature, nonspecific binding was blocked for 30 min at room temperature with phosphate buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Subsequently, the sections were incubated with a mouse anti-ABCG2 monoclonal anti-body BXP-21 [[25](#R25)], diluted 1:50 in phosphate buffered saline with 1% BSA (final concentration: 5 μg/ml), for 60 min at room temperature. Sections were developed using Powervision plus visualization system (ImmunoLogic, Duiven, The Netherlands) and AEC (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and counterstained with hematoxylin. Control for nonspecific staining was the replacement of BXP-21 with a nonspecific antibody from the same class, mouse IgG2a (DakoCytomation).

### Immunohistochemistry scoring

Protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was evaluated using an Olympus BX50F bright field microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with a 20× objective. Scoring was performed by two independent observers (C Lemos and GL Scheffer). Both the intensity (negative: 0, weak positive: 1, moderately positive: 2, strong positive: 3) and the percentages of positively stained cells were scored. Two tumor cores per patient were evaluated and the average score was calculated. Some cases suffered tissue loss or lack of tumor cell representation to an extent that precluded the evaluation of protein expression. The staining intensity value was multiplied by the percentage of positive cells [[26](#R26)], yielding a final expression score ranging from 0 to 300.

### Statistical analysis

Demographic and clinical information were compared across genotype, using the Pearson-χ^2^ two-sided test. Patients achieving complete (CR) or partial response (PR) **were defined as** ‘**respond**ers’, while patients with stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) as ‘nonresponders’. Additional analyses were performed by grouping patients with CR/PR and SD (‘patients with clinical benefit’) versus PD [[27](#R27)].

Time to progression (TTP) was calculated from the date of the first dose of gefitinib to the date of clinical and/or radiological evidence of progression/death, whichever occurred first, while overall survival (OS) was calculated from the day the treatment was initiated to the end point (death or censoring). The Kaplan–Meier method was used to plot TTP and OS, and the log-rank test to compare curves.

The univariate analysis included several clinical characteristics. Baseline demographic characteristics included sex, performance status (0–1 vs 2–3), age (<median vs ≥median), clinical stage (IIIB vs IV), histology (adenocarcinoma vs other histology, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma [BAC] vs other histology), smoking history (never, i.e., <100 cigarettes/lifetime vs former [quit smoking more than 12 months before starting gefitinib] and current smokers) and prior chemotherapy (yes vs no). Clinical treatment effects included toxicity (grade 0–1 vs grade 2+), and response to therapy, categorized as described earlier. Regarding polymorphisms, statistical analyses were performed by grouping patients according to different allelic activity, as previously described, for example, *ABCG2* 421C/C versus C/A-A/A, *ABCG2* 1143C/C-C/T versus T/T and *ABCG2* −15622C/C-C/T versus T/T [[19](#R19),[20](#R20),[22](#R22)].

The nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used when analyzing the correlation of *ABCG2* polymorphisms with ABCG2 protein expression determined by IHC.

All the analyses of the samples were carried out in a blinded fashion relative to clinical outcome. Data were analyzed using SPSS-17 software (SPSS, Inc., IL, USA). p-values between 0.05 and 0.1 were regarded as marginally suggestive of an association (‘trend toward a significant correlation’), but only p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. However, in the analyses for clinical outcome and toxicity according to the three studied *ABCG2* polymorphisms and *ABCG2* haplotype, a Bonferroni correction required a p < 0.05/4 = 0.0125 for statistical significance.

## Results

### Patients’ characteristics& clinical outcome

Patient characteristics and their association with clinical outcome are summarized in [TABLE 1](#T1). Response and TTP data were available from all patients, while OS was available from 92 patients. There were 87 deaths (event rate 94.6%) while two patients were alive without PD at last contact (January 2010). A total of 17 out of the 94 patients evaluated (18.1%) had PR, while 36 (38.3%) and 41 (43.6%) had SD and PD, respectively. Response was significantly higher among females and never smokers, whereas other patient characteristics were not associated with response. Median TTP and OS were 3.2 and 8.0 months, respectively. Negative smoker history and BAC histology were associated with significantly longer TTP and OS. Older patients also had a significantly longer TTP, whereas the female gender was associated with a significantly longer OS. Finally, both response and clinical benefit were associated with significantly longer TTP and OS.

### ABCG2 polymorphisms

Previous studies demonstrated no differences in polymorphisms analyzed in tumors and normal tissues [[28](#R28)–[30](#R30)]. However, we performed preliminary studies of *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism in 45 paired DNA samples isolated from germline and lung cancer, hence displaying identical interindividual genotypes between normal and malignant tissues. Therefore, for the 94 patients enrolled in the present study the genotyping was performed with DNA extracted from the available 49 tumors and 45 blood samples. The wild-type *ABCG2* 421C/A genotype (CC) had a frequency of 88.3%, whereas the CA and AA genotypes were found in 10.6 and 1.1% of the patients, respectively. For the *ABCG2* 1143C/T polymorphism, the frequencies of the CC, *CT* and TT genotypes were 59.3, 37.4 and 3.3%, respectively. Regarding the *ABCG2* −15622C/T promoter polymorphism, the CC, CT and TT variants were observed in 52.8, 39.3 and 7.9% of the cases, respectively. For the *ABCG2* haplotype- we grouped the patients according to the combination of their *ABCG2* 1143C/T and *ABCG2* −15622C/T polymorphisms, as previously described [[22](#R22)]. A total of seven (8%) patients had at least one copy of TT in the *ABCG2* haplotype, while 81 (92%) individuals had no TT copies in this haplotype ([TABLE 2](#T2)). All polymorphisms followed Hardy–Weinberg’s equilibrium ([TABLE 2](#T2)), as calculated with the SNP analyzer software [103].

Table 2 Caption: Clinical outcome according to polymorphisms.

Furthermore, the allelic frequencies for these *ABCG2* polymorphisms were comparable with those reported in previous studies in Caucasian NSCLC patients [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)]. Linkage disequilibrium between each pair of SNPs was calculated and plotted using the Innate Immunity PGA, NHLBI Program LDPlotter tool (see [SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE 1](#SD1); [www.futuremedicine.com/doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs.10.172](http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/suppl/10.2217/pgs.10.172)). No significant correlations were observed between *ABCG2* polymorphisms and patients’ characteristics, including age, gender, smoking history, clinical stage, performance status and histology.

### Polymorphisms & clinical outcome

Considering that ABCG2 is a drug efflux transporter with the ability to extrude gefinitib out of the cells, we hypothesized that the *ABCG2* polymorphisms, with potential implications on ABCG2 protein expression and transport function, might affect the drug response rate and clinical outcome. However, the *ABCG2* polymorphisms evaluated were not significantly associated with response. By grouping patients with clinical benefit versus those without clinical benefit, we also did not find an association with the studied polymorphisms. In addition, no association was observed between *ABCG2* polymorphisms and TTP and OS ([TABLE 2](#T2)). However, a trend toward a significant correlation was observed between the *ABCG2* haplotype and TTP, with patients harboring at least one TT copy having shorter TTP (p = 0.06), as well as between the *ABCG2*-15622C/T polymorphism and TTP (p = 0.07).

### Polymorphisms & toxicity

Among the 87 patients evaluable for skin toxicity, 41 (47.1%) had no toxicity while 24 (27.6%) developed a grade 1 skin rash and 22 (25.3%) developed a grade 2 or 3 skin rash. Regarding the 85 patients evaluable for gastrointestinal toxicity, 27 patients (31.8%) developed grade 1, while 6 patients (7.0%) had grade 2 or 3 diarrhea, while 52 (61.2%) exhibited no toxicity. None of our patients experienced lung toxicity. According to previous analyses [[20](#R20),[28](#R28)], we grouped our population in patients with toxicity (grade 1+) versus patients without toxicity (grade 0) and in patients with ‘low’ (grade 0–1) versus patients with ‘high’ (grade 2–3) toxicity.

No significant correlations were observed between skin or gastrointestinal toxicities and TTP or OS. Younger patients (<63.5 years), females and patients who had received previous treatment more frequently developed a higher grade (>1) skin rash (p = 0.03, p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively), while stage IV patients experienced significantly more skin toxicity (p = 0.02).

The associations between *ABCG2* polymorphisms and toxicity are described in [TABLE 3](#T3); the *ABCG2* −15622C/T polymorphism was significantly associated with gastrointestinal toxicity, in particular with moderate to severe diarrhea. A total of 50% of the patients developing grade 2 or 3 gastrointestinal toxicity carried the TT genotype. By contrast, only three out of 74 (4.1%) patients with the CC-CT variants developed grade 2/3 diarrhea. Regarding the *ABCG2* haplotype, we also found a strong association with higher grade diarrhea: 42.9% (three out of seven) patients carrying at least one TT copy in the *ABCG2* haplotype had grade 2/3 diarrhea in comparison to 4.1% (three out of 73) patients without any copy of TT.

Table 3 Caption: Toxicity according to polymorphisms.

In order to keep the probability of finding a statistically significant difference purely by chance to a minimum, the usual nominal level (p = 0.05) has been lowered to 0.0125 by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. After this adjustment, the *ABCG2* −15622T/T polymorphism and *ABCG2* haplotype were still significantly correlated to grade 2/3 diarrhea.

We did not observe significant association between *ABCG2* polymorphisms and skin toxicity, although the *ABCG2* 1143C/T polymorphism showed a trend toward a significant association with skin rash. In addition, we did not observe a significant association between the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism and any kind of toxicity.

### Polymorphisms & ABCG2 protein expression

ABCG2 protein expression was evaluated by IHC in 49 patients using a tissue microarray. Owing to tissue loss or lack of tumor cell representation in both tumor cores of two patients, ABCG2 protein expression was evaluable in a total of 47 patients. [FIGURE 1](#F1) shows representative images of immuno-histochemical staining intensities for *ABCG2*. A total of 24 (51.1%) patients had no ABCG2 protein expression in their lung tumor tissue, while 23 (48.9%) patients displayed variable expression of the ABCG2 protein. We compared the ABCG2 protein expression across the different genotypes, but we did not find any association between the *ABCG2* polymorphisms and the levels of protein expression in the lung tumor tissue of this group of patients ([FIGURE 2](#F2)). As previously mentioned, ABCG2 expression might affect gefitinib resistance phenotypes [[9](#R9)]. Therefore, we also studied the correlation between ABCG2 expression in the lung tissue with response and clinical outcome. However, we did not find any association between the protein expression of ABCG2 and response, clinical benefit, TTP and OS (data not shown).

## Discussion

In the present study, we evaluated the associations between *ABCG2* polymorphisms and clinical outcome and toxicity in advanced NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to identify a correlation between the *ABCG2* −15622C/T polymorphism- and the *ABCG2* (1143C/T, −15622C/T) haplotype with moderate-to-severe (grade 2/3) diarrhea in gefitinib-treated patients. The current findings should prompt further prospective trials to validate the role of these *ABCG2* polymorphisms for treatment selection and improve patient quality of life and compliance. Indeed, the toxicity profile of gefitinib is mild, but diarrhea occurred in 49% of patients in the NSCLC trials and could affect the quality of life. The patients may have as many as five to seven episodes of diarrhea a day. Notably, for more than seven stools a day (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 3 or 4), gefitinib should be stopped for up to 14 days until diarrhea has resolved. When gefitinib treatment is resumed, it should be at a lower dose, while patients should be instructed on diarrhea management, including diet and antidiarrheal regimens. Conversely, patients harboring genotypes more resistant to drug toxic effects could be treated with higher doses.

Several previous studies have been devoted to identify molecular markers that can predict response and toxicity to TKIs in NSCLC. An important group of potential markers includes germline polymorphisms in relevant genes such as the direct targets of these drugs (i.e., EGFR and VEGFR), metabolizing enzymes (CYP enzymes) and efflux transporters (ABCB1 and ABCG2) [[20](#R20),[22](#R22),[28](#R28)]. In this respect, we have previously reported an association of the AKT1-SNP4 polymorphism with TTP and OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib, as well as a correlation between the *EGFR* −191C/A, −216G/T and *R497K* polymorphisms and gefitinib-induced gastrointestinal toxicity [[28](#R28)]. EGFR-activating mutations were also predictive for response, progression and OS, but not for toxicity, as reported previously [[29](#R29)]. Indeed, while polymorphisms might increase the genetic susceptibility to tumor response and skin/gastrointestinal toxicity because they occur in both normal and tumor tissues, activating mutations in *EGFR* should not play a role in toxicity because they are harbored solely by tumor tissues. Moreover, polymorphisms can be assessed with a simple blood test, and their analysis is easier to adopt in the routine clinical setting than tumor gene-expression arrays, which require core needle biopsies of patient’s tumors with laser microdissection and subsequent sophisticated infrastructure. In particular, assessing germline polymorphisms is extremely appealing in the advanced cancer setting, when diagnosis is usually performed from small needle biopsy samples and the handling of tumor material can be problematic.

Our results corroborate the findings of several published studies, demonstrating that our population is representative of Caucasian populations treated with gefitinib. Therefore, in the current study we explored the impact of *ABCG2* polymorphisms in the same population of NSCLC patients.

ABCG2 is a member of the G subfamily of ABC transporters. This integral transmembrane pump protein is expressed in apical membranes of several organs, including the liver, kidney, brain and intestine [[25](#R25)]. The apical membrane localization of ABCG2 in epithelial cells along the gastrointestinal tract suggests a major role for this transporter in the first line of defense against xenobiotics [[30](#R30)]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that polymorphisms that impact on the expression and/or efflux function of this pump protein, might markedly alter the absorption, bioavailability and elimination of orally administered drugs, as is the case with gefitinib, thereby affecting the drug-induced toxicity or efficacy [[31](#R31)–[33](#R33)].

The *ABCG2* 1143T/T and −15622T/T polymorphic variants were recently associated with decreased ABCG2 mRNA expression in various tissues, including the intestine [[21](#R21)]. Although lower ABCG2 mRNA levels are not necessarily associated with lower protein levels and/or lower activity, they can be indicative of a potential impact of these polymorphisms on ABCG2 expression and function. Consistently, we observed that individuals carrying the *ABCG2* −15622T/T genotype had significantly more grade 2–3 diarrhea, as well as patients harboring one copy of TT in the *ABCG2* haplotype. Given the small number (n = 7) of patients harboring the risk genotype, in order to determine whether or not other factors could potentially explain the occurrence of diarrhea, we carefully examined their baseline demographic and biological characteristics, which were similar to the average of the studied population. Furthermore, we used the Bonferroni correction to reduce false-positive findings, demonstrating that the *ABCG2* −15622T/T polymorphic*-* variant and the *ABCG2* TT haplotype were still significantly associated with grade 2/3 diarrhea. Our results are in line with the previously reported association of the *ABCG2* TT haplotype with increased toxicity (any toxicity > grade 2) in sunitinib-treated patients [[22](#R22)]. Moreover, this haplotype has also been associated with increased erlotinib exposure [[20](#R20)]. Altogether, these results suggest that the TT genotype is associated with a lower expression and/or decreased activity of ABCG2, which thereby affects the elimination of these TKIs and increases the drug-induced toxicity. These polymorphisms should be used together with *EGFR* −191C/A, −216G/T and R497K in order to identify optimal candidates for gefitinib treatment, thereby reducing the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity that markedly affects patient’s quality of life, provided that their role is firmly established in prospective trials.

In the present study, no associations were detected with skin toxicity. These data are in agreement with the study by Rudin *et al.*, which skin toxicity was correlated with erlotinib exposure levels, but not with *ABCG2* 421C/A, 1143C/T or −15622C/T [[20](#R20)]. Furthermore, the 250 mg/day dose of gefitinib used in our patients is well below the maximum tolerated dose and the incidence of skin toxicity was significantly lower than with 500 mg/day gefitinib [[34](#R34)].

Cusatis *et al.* reported a strong association between the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism and diarrhea in gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients [[19](#R19)]. Furthermore, they suggested that their results reported for gefitinib would be representative for other orally ingested drugs that are transported by ABCG2 such as erlotinib. However, Rudin *et al.* found no correlation between the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism and diarrhea or skin rash in erlotinib-treated patients [[20](#R20)]. Also, Akasaka *et al.* found no association between this polymorphism and diarrhea in gefitinib-treated Japanese NSCLC patients [[35](#R35)]. Consistently, we did not find any association between the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism and gefitinib-induced toxicity in our population. Of note, several *in vitro* studies demonstrate that the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism is associated with lower ABCG2 protein expression [[11](#R11),[12](#R12)] and transport function [[16](#R16)]. Moreover, Kobayashi *et al.* assessed the ABCG2 protein expression in human placentas in relation to the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism and found that the protein level was significantly lower in patients homozygous for the A421 allele than in those homozygous for the C421 allele, while heterozygotes had an intermediate expression [[13](#R13)]. By contrast, Urquhart *et al.* showed that the ABCG2 protein and mRNA expression in the human intestine did not significantly differ between patients carrying different variants of the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism, which might explain the lack of effect that this polymorphism had on gefitinib-induced diarrhea in our population of NSCLC patients [[36](#R36)].

ABCG2 is also expressed in the lungs [[23](#R23)], where it might play a role in the efficacy of gefitinib. It is well described that ABCG2 overexpression is commonly associated with multidrug resistance, as this transporter has the ability to extrude its drug substrates out of the cells, thereby decreasing their intracellular accumulation [[37](#R37)]. Therefore, we hypothesized that different *ABCG2* polymorphisms could have an impact on the treatment response, as well as on the TTP and OS. However, we did not find any significant association between the evaluated *ABCG2* polymorphims and response, clinical benefit, TTP and OS. We did, however, observe a trend towards a significant correlation between the *ABCG2* haplotype and TTP, with patients carrying at least one TT copy having shorter TTP. It is not likely that these results are directly linked with gefitinib resistance, since this haplotype was not associated with response. In order to further understand these results, we analyzed the ABCG2 protein expression in the lung tumor tissue of 49 patients. In this patient population, we did not find a correlation between the different variants of each polymorphism and the levels of protein expression, although IHC is only semiquantitative.

Furthermore, we failed to find a correlation between ABCG2 protein expression and response, clinical benefit, TTP and OS, which might be a result of the small patient group available for this analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating ABCG2 protein expression in relation to these three *ABCG2* polymorphisms in lung tissue. As mentioned earlier, the *ABCG2* 1143C/T and −15622C/T polymorphisms were associated with decreased levels of ABCG2 expression [[21](#R21)]. However, Poonkuzhali *et al.* evaluated ABCG2 mRNA levels, while we determined the levels of protein expression, which might not be correlated. In addition, the tissues analyzed by Poonkuzhali *et al.* did not include the lung [[21](#R21)], suggesting that the impact of these polymorphism on protein expression might be tissue-specific. The same might apply to the *ABCG2* 421C/A polymorphism, which was associated with decreased levels of protein expression in human placentas [[13](#R13)], but not in human intestine [[36](#R36)] and lung (present study).

## Conclusion

Our findings demonstrate a strong association between the *ABCG2* −15622C/T polymorphism and the *ABCG2* haplotype with grade 2/3 diarrhea induced by gefitinib. Since these polymorphisms can be assessed with a simple blood test, the *ABCG2* haplotype has also been previously associated with sunitinib-induced toxicity and erlotinib accumulation [[20](#R20),[22](#R22)], and novel EGFR TKIs, such as the potent, irreversible, dual EGFR and HER2-TKI BIBW 2992, induce a higher degree of severe diarrhea [[37](#R37),[38](#R38)], *ABCG2* genotyping might be an easy test to adopt in the routine clinical setting to enhance the selection of patients for different TKI that are currently available. In particular, these germline polymorphisms, together with *EGFR* −191C/A, −216G/T and R497K [[28](#R28)], might improve the stratification of patients for TKI treatments by identifying genetically high-risk subgroups for gastrointestinal toxicity. Therefore, larger prospective trials are warranted to validate these findings, which might be applied to the future practice of cancer treatment.
