## Abstract

**Aim:** 
SLCO1B1 variants are associated with intermediate outcomes that may increase risk of death/myocardial infarction (MI) in statin-treated patients.

**Patients & methods:** 
In high-risk Caucasians undergoing cardiac catheterization, we tested the association between rs4149056/625T>C and rs2306283/492A>G with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) over 3 years (n = 1402) and death/MI over 6 years (n = 2994), accounting for statin use or type during follow-up.

**Results:** 
Carriers of the rs4149056 C allele had 6.2 ± 1.7 mg/dl higher LDL-c per C allele (p < 0.001) but were not at higher risk for death/MI (p = 0.9). We found no associations between rs2306283 and LDL-c or death/MI (p > 0.6).

**Conclusion:** 
Functional SLCO1B1 variants are not associated with death/MI in patients commonly treated with statins, despite higher LDL-c in carriers of the rs4149056 C allele.

### Aim

*SLCO1B1* variants are associated with intermediate outcomes that may increase risk of death/myocardial infarction (MI) in statin-treated patients.

### Patients & methods

In high-risk Caucasians undergoing cardiac catheterization, we tested the association between rs4149056/625T>C and rs2306283/492A>G with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) over 3 years (n = 1402) and death/MI over 6 years (n = 2994), accounting for statin use or type during follow-up.

### Results

Carriers of the rs4149056 C allele had 6.2 ± 1.7 mg/dl higher LDL-c per C allele (p < 0.001) but were not at higher risk for death/MI (p = 0.9). We found no associations between rs2306283 and LDL-c or death/MI (p > 0.6).

### Conclusion

Functional *SLCO1B1* variants are not associated with death/MI in patients commonly treated with statins, despite higher LDL-c in carriers of the rs4149056 C allele.

## Patients & methods

### Study population

The study population was selected from patients enrolled in the Duke Catheterization Genetics (CATHGEN) biorepository: a registry of clinical data, longitudinal yearly follow-up data and blood samples collected from 9334 subjects who presented to Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) for cardiac catheterization from 2001 to 2010. Details of CATHGEN have been previously published [[30](#R30)]. We identified 3409 Caucasians who had available genotype data for rs2306283 and rs4149056 ([Figure 1](#F1)). All subjects consented to participation in CATHGEN. This study and CATHGEN were approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board.

LDL-c: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; MI: Myocardial infarction.

### Genotyping

Genotyping for 3409 Caucasians was performed on two platforms: 1919 individuals using the Affymetrix Axiom chip as part of a previous study in nondiabetic CATHGEN patients [[31](#R31)] and 2300 using the Illumina Human Omni1-Quad Bead Chip. Two individuals failed quality control (call rate > 99% for both platforms) and four individuals were excluded because they were genotyped on both platforms but had discordant genotypes, resulting in 3403 unique individuals ([Figure 1](#F1)). Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium for rs4149056 and rs2306283 was checked using PLINK, Version 1.07 [[32](#R32),[33](#R33)]. Genotypes were coded to test an additive model, based on prior observations supporting this relationship [[34](#R34)], defined as 0, 1, or 2 copies of the minor allele. Haplotypes (**1a*, **1b*, **5* and **15*) were constructed from the two genotypes such that the **1a* haplotype was designated the reference (i.e., N130, V174).

### Study definitions

#### Baseline characteristics

Baseline variables collected at the time of catheterization included age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CAD, smoking, left ventricular ejection fraction and LDL-c. CAD was defined as the presence of any of the following: CAD index ≥32 (a summary of angiographic data [[35](#R35)]) or ≥1 epicardial coronary artery with ≥75% stenosis on cardiac catheterization including the CATHGEN enrollment catheterization, history of previous MI, previous coronary artery bypass graft, or interventional cardiac catheterization procedure (i.e., coronary angioplasty and/or stenting).

#### Medication data

Admission and discharge medications at the time of catheterization were collected through chart review as part of CATHGEN. Medication data with a report date of ≤60 days prior to catheterization were considered to be at baseline. As part of CATHGEN, subjects provided a list of their medications annually following index enrollment cardiac catheterization. Of the 3403 individuals with genotyping data that passed quality control, 409 did not have subject-reported medication data, resulting in 2994 individuals ([Figure 1](#F1)) for analysis. The first 3 years of medication data were utilized for the association with LDL-c. If multiple medication reports for a period were available, the measurement with the latest report date within the interval was used.

Subject-reported statin utilization at the end of each interval (i.e., baseline, baseline to 1 year, 1–2 years, 2–3 years) was coded as a dichotomous variable, regardless of statin type. For statin-specific effects, a separate four-level variable was created for statin type and coded as: ‘simvastatin’, ‘atorvastatin’, ‘other statin’ (containing all remaining statin types) and ‘no statin’ for each interval. Individuals who changed statin type from one interval to another were included in the analyses through the use of a mixed-effect model (see below), thus allowing for all available data during follow-up to be included. The resulting dataset captured subject-reported statin utilization and categorized individuals as taking or not taking a statin for any given interval.

#### Cardiovascular event data

All 2994 individuals with subject-reported medication data had complete follow-up data for the occurrence of first MI or death in the period after catheterization ([Figure 1](#F1)).

#### Laboratory data

LDL-c levels at four time points: baseline (≤60 days prior to catheterization), and 1, 2 and 3 years following cardiac catheterization were analyzed. LDL-c levels were obtained using Duke Enterprise Data Unified Content Explorer (DEDUCE), a web-based query tool [[36](#R36)] that allows extraction of laboratory data from DUMC patients. If multiple LDL-c levels for an interval were available, the measurement with the most recent report date within that interval was used. LDL-c levels were primarily calculated from the Friedewald equation [[37](#R37)] and were not used if triglyceride levels were >400 mg/dl. Of the 2994 individuals with available genotype and medication data, only those with both medication and LDL-c data available for at least one time point over the 3-year follow-up period were included for analysis, resulting in 1402 unique individuals ([Figure 1](#F1)).

### Statistical analysis

#### Survival analyses

To assess the effect of genotype/haplotype on a composite outcome of incident death/MI following catheterization, an extended Cox model was performed, where statin utilization was modeled as a time-dependent covariate. The date of catheterization was considered as time zero. For the first interval (i.e., from catheterization to first survey) we defined statin usage based on available medication data within 30 days of the catheterization date. For each subject-reported medication survey following catheterization, the interval was defined as the time between that survey and the next survey. Individuals who missed at least one annual survey received 16 months of credit for their previous medication report, chosen because 95% of the time elapsed between surveys fell within this time range (data not shown). Multivariable analyses, adjusting for age, BMI, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CAD and smoking, were performed and interaction terms were introduced.

#### LDL-c analyses

To assess for effects of genotype/haplotype on LDL-c, linear mixed models were used to account for the repeated measures within an individual and to control for the effects of subject-reported statin utilization and statin type over time as well as multivariable analysis adjusting for known predictors of statin-mediated LDL-c lowering: age, BMI, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CAD and smoking [[38](#R38),[39](#R39)]. Interaction terms were introduced to assess homogeneity of genotype effects on LDL-c by statin type.

SAS statistical software, Version 9.3 (SAS Institutes, Cary, NC, USA) was used for mixed models analyses. All other analyses were performed using R statistical software [[40](#R40)].

## Results

[Table 1](#T1) summarizes baseline characteristics for the 2994 Caucasian individuals in the study with available genotype and medication data. The study population was ~60% male and broadly representative of a population with established cardiovascular disease. Allele frequencies were consistent with those previously reported and did not differ between geno typing platforms (data not shown). No deviations from Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium were observed.

### Association of genetic variants with long-term clinical events

There were 169 MI and 374 death events, combining for an event rate of 18% over a median follow-up of 5.6 ± 2.4 years. In unadjusted extended Cox models, neither rs2306283 (HR 0.99; 95% CI [0.88–1.12], p = 0.94) nor rs4149056 (HR 0.99; 95% CI [0.84–1.17]; p = 0.93) was associated with the composite outcome of death/MI. As expected, statin usage was independently associated with better long-term survival (HR 0.68; 95% CI [0.57–0.81]; p < 0.001). There was no evidence of interactions between either rs2306283 or rs4149056 and statin type (p > 0.12). Multivariable and haplotype analyses were consistent with findings in univariate analysis (data not shown).

### Association of genetic variants with LDL-c levels

In models that accounted for statin use, rs4149056 genotype (p = 0.0003) was associated with LDL-c levels during follow-up. Carriers of the C allele for rs4149056 had an estimated 6.2 ± 1.7 mg/dl higher LDL-c level per C allele ([Figure 2](#F2)). We did not find an interaction between rs4149056 and statin type ([Figure 3](#F3), p = 0.38). Multivariable and haplotype analyses revealed consistent findings as the univariate models using rs4149056 alone (data not shown). We did not find an association between rs2306283 and LDL-c levels ([Figure 4](#F4), p = 0.68) or an interaction between rs2306283 and statin type ([Figure 5](#F5), p = 0.40).

Displayed are means and standard errors of LDL-c levels by rs4149056 genotype. Levels of significance were obtained using linear mixed models for an additive model, adjusted for subject-reported statin utilization and time. Per C allele, there was a ~5% higher LDL-c over a 3-year follow-up period. LDL-c: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

An interaction term assessed homogeneity of genotype effects on LDL-c by statin type. Due to the analysis, statin type subgroups contained overlapping individuals. There was no evidence for rs4149056 genotype by statin type interaction. LDL-c: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

## Discussion

### Association of genetic variants with long-term clinical events

Genetic variation in *SLCO1B1* has been well described, and two common, functional genetic variants (rs2306283 and rs4149056) lead to differences in hepatic uptake, statin clearance, different risks for statin-induced side effects, premature drug discontinuation and reduced hepatic uptake [[15](#R15)–[19](#R19),[29](#R29)]. Since statins are long-term medications and prior studies were primarily short-term clinical trials [[15](#R15),[16](#R16),[22](#R22)–[25](#R25)] that could not examine any effects on clinical outcomes, we examined the impact of these common, functional variants on cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort representative of patients with complex cardiovascular disease in a ‘real-world’ clinical setting. We hypothesized that the combined effects of *SLCO1B1* variants on intermediate outcomes would result in differences in long-term risk for death/MI following cardiac catheterization – two outcomes known to be prevented by statin use. Although statin use was strongly associated with a decreased risk for death/MI in our cohort and lower LDL-c, thus establishing the validity of statin exposure data, we found no association between either rs2306283 or rs4149056 and death/MI, despite the higher LDL-c levels in carriers of the C allele for rs4149056. Our results appear to be consistent with that seen by Akao *et al.*, who found no association between rs4149056 or rs2306283 and coronary heart disease (CHD) events in a placebo-controlled trial of 40 mg/day pravastatin in elderly men and women [[26](#R26)].

Clinical trials have shown a log-linear relationship between LDL-c and relative risk for CHD where the relative risk for CHD is reduced by 1% for every 1% reduction in LDL-c [[1](#R1),[41](#R41)]. For rs4149056, we observed ~5% higher LDL-c per C allele over 3 years, which should have translated to a predicted 5% increase in clinical events per C allele. In a *post-hoc* power analysis, we had adequate statistical power to detect a 10% or greater difference in risk between carriers and non-carriers. Therefore, although we did not have sufficient power to detect a 5% higher risk, our sample size was large enough to exclude an increased risk of death/MI of greater than 10% between carriers and non carriers. To further explore the lack of association between genetic variants and cardiac events, we performed exploratory analysis testing for an association between the **5* allele and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. However, we did not find evidence of an association between rs4149056 and HDL-c (p = 0.70) to support a protective mechanism through elevations in HDL-c.

Compared to a prior study by Peters *et al.* [[42](#R42)] in which the authors identified a potential interaction between the **15/*15* haplotype and statin use on MI, we did not find any evidence for any differential effects (haplotype by statin use interaction in the current study, p-value = 0.78). In comparison to the study by Peters *et al.*, which was a retrospective case–control study of patients with hyperlipidemia that survived MI, our study population was a larger cohort of high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease who were prospectively followed for death/MI. Therefore, our study design eliminated the potential biases introduced through a case–control study of MI survivors and thus resolves any uncertainty regarding the association of genetic variation in *SLCO1B1* and cardiovascular events in patients taking statins.

### Association of genetic variants with LDL-c levels

We hypothesized that the combined effects of altered hepatic uptake of statins and risk of drug discontinuation as a result of side effects would lead to different LDL-c levels in carriers versus noncarriers. We found that carriers of the C allele for rs4149056 had, on average, a ~5% higher LDL-c per C allele over 3 years. At baseline at the time of cardiac catheterization, there were no significant differences in LDL-c between carriers and noncarriers (p = 0.93), which was expected since genetic variants in *SLCO1B1* do not affect native, pre-statin LDL-c levels [[43](#R43),[44](#R44)]. The direction of association between the **5* variant and higher LDL-c in this patient-based cohort with cardiovascular disease was consistent with prior clinical trial data and short-term statin exposure studies, in which a 1–3% higher LDL-c per allele was observed [[15](#R15),[16](#R16),[22](#R22)–[26](#R26)]. Moreover, the association with LDL-c appeared to be consistent across statin types. Therefore, in a clinically relevant, high-risk cardiovascular cohort, the *SLCO1B1*5* variant is associated with higher LDL-c.

### Limitations

The largest limitations to our study were the lack of day-to-day statin adherence data and statin dose information. Indirect surrogates for adherence, such as patient questionnaires used in our study, can be biased by poor patient recall, inconsistent reporting, and may result in an inaccurate estimation of medication adherence [[45](#R45)]. Despite these known limitations, we chose to include self-reported statin utilization data in our statistical models, though we acknowledge that these data cannot substitute for the day-to-day variability in statin adherence. Nevertheless, subject-reported statin use in our cohort was strongly associated with lower LDL-c and lower risk for death/MI, and thus was an adequate surrogate for long-term statin utilization. Although alternative metrics for true statin adherence have been proposed, no other adherence metrics were available to us in this retrospective data.

Another limitation of this study was that only individuals who were seen for clinical follow-up at DUMC were included in the LDL-c analysis. These patients likely received closer monitoring and higher statin doses, which may have resulted in an overestimated effect size. Using only LDL-c levels from DUMC also increased the amount of missing data in the mixed-model analyses and could have introduced bias. However, we tested for and found no association between missing data and the **5* variant (p = 0.6).

In addition, the rs2306283 and rs4149056 variants may not have entirely captured OATP1B1 transporter activity and the sole use of these variants alone may have misclassified individuals. Rare variants would, in part, have overcome this limitation, as evidenced by a recent study on methotrexate clearance, where these variants accounted for 17.8% of *SLCO1B1*’s effects [[46](#R46)]. In addition, alternate biomarkers for OATP1B1 activity (e.g., bilirubin, bile acids) may further allow for more accurate phenotyping in clinical cohort studies. However, such additional granularity is unlikely to have meaningfully changed our conclusions since the upper limit of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio for death/MI in those who carried of two copies of the **5* variant (i.e., null predicted OATP1B1 function) was only 1.9 and lower than what many would agree is a clinically actionable increased risk.

## Conclusion

Two common, functional genetic variants in *SLCO1B1* were not associated with long-term clinical outcomes in patients at high risk for cardio vascular disease that are commonly treated with statins, despite an association between the *SLCO1B1*5* allele and higher LDL-c levels in this cohort.

## Future perspective

The data presented in our study illustrate that despite a higher LDL-c observed in **5* carriers, these individuals did not experience an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular events. Given the lack of difference in clinical outcomes for both rs4149056 and rs2306283, this study, which involves primarily simvastatin and atorvastatin, along with another study focused on pravastatin [[26](#R26)], suggests a limited role for routine genetic testing for variants in *SLCO1B1* for reducing cardiovascular risk in statin-treated patients. We acknowledge the limitations of our study design and advocate that future studies are necessary in order to further elucidate the clinical utility of these variants on cardiovascular outcomes. However, we believe that *SLCO1B1* genetic information may be useful in reducing major side effects such as rhabdomyolysis [[47](#R47)] as well as in improving LDL-c lowering outcomes since certain statins (e.g., rosuvastatin or fluvastatin) are well tolerated [[22](#R22)] and minimally handled by this transporter.
