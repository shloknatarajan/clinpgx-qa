## Abstract

**Aim:** 
Pain is prevalent in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients who display great heterogeneity in pain severity and frequency. Hypothesizing that inflammatory factors are involved in the pathogenesis of SCD pain, we focused on the IL1A C/T polymorphism rs1800587 that is an SNP located in a cis-transcriptional regulatory region.

**Methods:** 
We genotyped IL1A rs1800587 and performed association studies with phenotype data obtained by a multidimensional pain assessment tool using the PAINReportIt® Questionnaire.

**Results:** 
Each T allele was associated with a 3.9 increase in composite pain index score (p = 0.04) as determined by multiple linear regression.

**Conclusion:** 
IL1A rs1800587 may influence chronic pain in SCD.

### Aim:

Pain is prevalent in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients who display great heterogeneity in pain severity and frequency. Hypothesizing that inflammatory factors are involved in the pathogenesis of SCD pain, we focused on the *IL1A* C/T polymorphism rs1800587 that is an SNP located in a *cis*-transcriptional regulatory region.

### Methods:

We genotyped *IL1A* rs1800587 and performed association studies with phenotype data obtained by a multidimensional pain assessment tool using the PAINReportIt^®^ Questionnaire.

### Results:

Each T allele was associated with a 3.9 increase in composite pain index score (p = 0.04) as determined by multiple linear regression.

### Conclusion:

*IL1A* rs1800587 may influence chronic pain in SCD.

## Methods

### Subjects

The Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois at Chicago approved the study. Subjects were recruited during routine clinic visits at the University of Illinois (UI) Hospital and Health Sciences System in Chicago (IL, USA). Participants provided written informed consent before blood or buccal swab samples were collected for DNA extraction. A total of 115 subjects are included in this study for whom both clinical pain phenotype and genetic samples were available.

### Assessment of chronic pain

A computerized multidimensional pain assessment tool, PAINReportIt^®^ [[2](#B2),[26](#B26),[27](#B27)] (Nursing Consult, LLC, WA, USA), was used for pain phenotyping. Subjects completed baseline pain location, intensity, quality and pattern during a routine clinic visit (i.e., not during pain crisis or other urgent care visits to the clinic). The composite pain index (CPI) score is a value on a 0–100 scale that is calculated from these raw scores: number of pain sites; average of current, least and worst pain intensity in the past 24 h; pain rating index total; and a pain pattern score that ranges from 0 to 6 [[28–30](#B28)]. This score represents the multidimensional pain experience at baseline.

### Assessment of acute pain

Visits or admission to the emergency department or acute care center as a result of a SCD pain crisis, denoted as utilization, was used as a surrogate marker for an acute crisis pain in SCD [[31](#B31)]. We documented the number of these utilizations each patient had for 12 months after completing the baseline pain assessment by reviewing medical records for utilizations made at UI or by biweekly telephone calls in the case that patients did not go to the UI for care but went to any nearest emergency department.

### DNA extraction & genotyping

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples by a modified salting out procedure [[32](#B32)] or the QuickGene-mini80 isolation device and QuickGene DNA whole blood extraction method (AutoGen, MA, USA). DNA from buccal samples were extracted using a modified phenol/chloroform procedure [[33](#B33)]. Genotyping was performed by the MassARRAY iPLEX Platform (Sequenom, CA, USA) where a single primer extension occurred upstream of the polymorphic site and was subsequently measured by MALDI-TOF MS [[34](#B34)].

### Statistical analysis

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was determined by a χ^2^ goodness-of-fit test. Additive (allele effects), dominant (combined major homozygous genotype and heterozygous vs minor homozygous genotypes) and recessive (major homozygous genotypes vs combined heterozygous and combined minor homozygous) multiple linear regression models [[35](#B35),[36](#B36)], adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and sickle cell type, were used for analysis of statistical association of the SNP with CPI (i.e., chronic pain). These genetic models were used because the mode of inheritance is not known for this SNP and it is a powerful way of detecting the effect of the SNP on phenotype data, although we do not correct for multiple testing in this exploratory analysis [[35](#B35)]. Association with utilization (i.e., acute pain) was analyzed by additive, dominant and recessive negative binomial regression models [[37](#B37)] adjusted for the same covariates. The negative binomial regression model is used for our utilization data due to overdispersed count outcome variables [[38](#B38)]. In other words, the utilization variances that are found within each genotype group are higher than the mean utilization of that same genotype group. SNP effects on utilization groups (three groups: zero events, 1–3 events and 4–38 events) were also analyzed by an ordinal logistic regression model adjusted for covariates [[26](#B26)]. Analyses were performed on SPSS software (version 22; IBM, NY, USA).

### Bioinformatics

The University of California at Santa Cruz Genome Browser (Human Feb. 2009 GRCh37/hg19 Assembly) [[39](#B39)] was used to obtain Encyclopedia of DNA Elements at University of California at Santa Cruz (ENCODE) data for DNase clusters [[40](#B40),[41](#B41),[42](#B42)]. ENCODE allows users to view functional elements within the human genome, including regulatory elements that were viewed for this study.

## Results

Patient demographics for all 115 subjects are provided in [Table 1](#T1). The mean age in this study was 34.1 years with a range of 15–70 years. The majority of our subjects enrolled are females, although we did not attempt to bias recruitment of females. Our cohort is predominantly self-reported African–Americans (97%) with three Hispanics and one Caucasian. The sickle cell genotypes that are present in our cohort include the sickle cell anemia group (SCD-SS, 80.9%), sickle hemoglobin C (SCD-SC, 9.6%) and sickle alpha and beta thalassemias (9.5%). The mean CPI was 40.7 with a wide range from 14.8 to 86.5. Number of utilization ranged from 0 to 38 within 1 year. Three groups are created from utilization rates: 0 utilization (15% of total patients), 1–3 (45%) and 4–38 (40%) based on previous studies where the distribution of acute healthcare utilization events were taken into account 4 [[26](#B26)].

*IL1A* rs1800587 genotype and allele frequencies are provided in [Table 2](#T2). No significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium were found for this SNP (p > 0.05). The T allele was associated with an increase of 3.85 in CPI score (B = 3.85 [95% CI: 0.15–7.56]; p = 0.042), additive multiple linear regression model ([Table 3](#T3)) and accounted for 3% of the variability in CPI (adjusted R^2^). In order to determine if there are effects of this SNP on phenotype in a dominant or recessive mode, we also used dominant and recessive multiple linear regression models to analyze the data. However, these latter analyses did not yield statistically significant findings (p = 0.108, 0.092, respectively).

We also determined the association between rs1800587 and utilization, which is used as a surrogate marker for acute crisis pain [[31](#B31)]. There was no statistical association between utilization and rs1800587 in additive, dominant or recessive models (incident rate ratio [IRR] = 0.93, 0.93, 0.90 [95% CI: 0.70–1.23, 0.55–1.56, 0.60–1.35]; p = 0.606, 0.774, 0.605, respectively, [Table 4](#T4)). Rs1800587 also did not associate with utilization groups when analyzed by the ordinal logistic regression model where the groups were categorized into high, low and zero utilization based on prior studies by additive, dominant and recessive models (estimate = -0.02, 0.22, -0.18 [95% CI: -0.54–0.51, -0.75–1.20, -0.94–0.58]; p = 0.949, 0.652, 0.637, respectively, [Table 4](#T4)) [[26](#B26)]. These findings suggested that *IL1A* rs1800587 influenced baseline, but not acute, pain in SCD.

Bioinformatics analysis further determined that rs1800587 is located within a DNase cluster containing *cis*-transcriptional regulatory factors [[41](#B41),[42](#B42)]. Two of 125 ENCODE cell types were affected at this region (chr2:113542806–113543010). H7-human embryonic stem cell (hESC) is a pluripotent cell line with high proliferative potential and greater nucleotide diversity within DNase hypersensitive regions [[42](#B42)]. The other cell line, human tracheal epithelial cell (pHTE), is a primary cell line with limited proliferative potential and lower nucleotide diversity.

## Discussion

In this study, we examined the potential influence of *IL1A* rs1800587 SNP on acute and chronic pain in patients with SCD. An innovative pain phenotyping method, the CPI, taken during routine clinic visits, was used to quantitatively and qualitatively record chronic pain on noncrisis days in patients with SCD. On the other hand, emergency or urgent care utilization due to sickle cell crisis pain was used as a surrogate marker for acute pain. We found that *IL1A* T allele was associated with a significant increase (3.85 points) in CPI score. This study identified an association between chronic pain with a proinflammatory cytokine *IL1A* SNP (rs1800587) in SCD. Our findings also independently confirm previous findings of an association between this SNP and other very different types of chronic pain, namely chronic lumbar radicular pain and low back pain [[24](#B24),[25](#B25),[43](#B43)].

IL-1α has been proposed as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in the IL-1 family [[15](#B15)]. The *IL1A* T allele has been found to possess increased transcriptional activity with enhanced gene expression [[23](#B23)]. Our study also shows that this SNP lies within a DNase cluster, which is commonly found to contain *cis*-regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters and silencers [[42](#B42)], but these elements have not been demonstrated for this locus so far. It is in agreement with previous studies that found this SNP has regulatory properties on *IL1A* gene expression [[44](#B44)]. Patients with the *IL1A* T allele may have higher levels of IL-1α in circulation with more intense inflammatory response.

IL-1α is reported to be more potent than IL-1β in inducing substance P expression in rat adult sensory neurons [[21](#B21)], which could potentially lower pain threshold and increase pain sensitivity. It is previously observed that immunoreactivity of substance P is increased in the skin of sickle cell mice, which was accompanied by hyperalgesia [[45](#B45)]. Another study shows that IL-1α level is elevated in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord, a major area for pain transmission and processing, after painful facet joint injury [[22](#B22)]. In addition, in a rat neuropathic pain model there was a significant elevation of IL-1α mRNA and protein level in dorsal root ganglion but not spinal cord, and intrathecal administration of IL-1α has anti-allodynic and antihyperalgesic effects [[46](#B46)]. Taken together, IL-1α is believed to play an important role in the development of neuropathic pain symptoms, although the exact mechanisms are still unclear.

Several clinical reports associated the *IL1A* genotype with chronic pain in patients. The *IL1A* CT/TT carriers in a Norwegian study were reported to have increased risk of chronic lumbar radicular pain after disc herniation [[24](#B24),[43](#B43)]. The *IL-1α* gene T allele was associated with increased pain intensity and corresponding reduced pressure pain thresholds in patients with symptomatic disk herniation [[24](#B24)]. Additionally, a possible association of *IL1A* T allele and low back pain has been suggested by a Finnish cohort [[25](#B25)]. Carriers of the *IL1A* T and in combination with the *IL-1RN* A^-1812^ allele have an increased risk of, more days and higher pain intensity of low back pain than noncarriers. In our SCD cohort, we found that the T allele was associated with increased CPI, a measurement for the baseline chronic pain, which is consistent with the previous findings. Utilization was used in this study to characterize acute pain phenotypes in SCD patients. However, the *IL1A* T allele does not alter odds of utilization, suggesting that carrying *IL1A* T allele does not increase the rate of acute pain crisis. The outcomes from this study may be limited by the sample. Results will need to be replicated in future studies.

## Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that *IL1A* polymorphism rs1800587 is associated with chronic pain in patients with SCD. *IL1A* T allele increases CPI score by 3.85, indicative of increased baseline chronic pain, while *IL1A* T allele does not affect the rate of acute pain crisis. This finding will provide insights into the heterogeneity and prospective genetics studies for pain in SCD.

## Future perspective

Pain is prevalent and debilitating in SCD patients with high variability and heterogeneity. The underlying contributors and mechanisms of pain in SCD are poorly understood. Our study implicated the possible involvement of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of pain in SCD. Future pain genetics and pharmacological studies can be designed to further unravel the role of inflammation in sickle cell pain. Studying the contributions of *IL1A* and other relevant gene polymorphisms may shed light on the etiology of the pain heterogeneity, allowing for precision pain medicine in SCD.
