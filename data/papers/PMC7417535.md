## Abstract

Genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters may affect irinotecan toxicity. Although genetic polymorphisms have been shown to influence the irinotecan toxicity, data are limited in Thai population. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the allele and genotype frequencies and the relationship between CYP3A4/5, DPYD, UGT1A1, ABCB1, and ABCC2 genetic variations and irinotecan-induced toxicity in Thai colorectal cancer patients. One hundred and thirty-two patients were genotyped, and the effect of genetic variations on irinotecan-induced toxicity was assessed in 66 patients who received irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Allele frequencies of ABCB1 c.1236C > T, ABCB1 c.3435C > T, ABCC2 c.3972C > T, ABCG2 c.421C > A, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*18, CYP3A5*3, DPYD*5, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A1*6 were 0.67, 0.43, 0.23, 0.27, 0.01, 0.02, 0.64, 0.19, 0.16, and 0.09, respectively. DPYD*2A and DPYD c.1774C > T variants were not detected in our study population. The ABCC2 c.3972C > T was significantly associated with grade 1–4 neutropenia (P < 0.012) at the first cycle. Patients carrying both UGT1A1*28 and *6 were significantly associated with severe neutropenia at the first (P < 0.001) and second (P = 0.017) cycles. In addition, patients carrying UG1A1*28 and *6 had significantly lower absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir at first (P < 0.001) and second (P = 0.001) cycles. This finding suggests that UGT1A1*28, *6, and ABCC2 c.3972C > T might be an important predictor for irinotecan-induced severe neutropenia.

## Introduction

Irinotecan (CPT-11), a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is commonly used for the treatment of colorectal, gastric, and lung cancer. Although irinotecan is efficient, it causes severe neutropenia and diarrhea in 20–35% of the patients^1,2^. Irinotecan is metabolized by carboxylesterases (CESs) to form the primary pharmacologically active metabolite SN-38. SN-38, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, binds to and stabilizes the topoisomerase I-DNA complex preventing the re-ligation of DNA during replication and transcription, and subsequently results in double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis^3,4^. The SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G), an inactive metabolite, is converted by uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in the liver and eliminated into bile by drug efflux transporters ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCG2^5,6^.

Several studies have described the complex pharmacogenetics of irinotecan^7–9^. *UGT1A1* polymorphisms in promoter and coding regions are associated with reduced enzyme activity and accumulation of SN-38G which increases the toxicity of irinotecan. Previous studies reported that patients carrying *UGT1A1*28* and **6* variants resulted in increased SN-38 activity leading to diarrhea and severe neutropenia^10,11^. *ABCB1* c.1236 C allele was significantly associated with grade 3/4 toxicities in metastatic colorectal cancer patients^12^, and *ABCB1* c.1236 T/T genotype was also associated with significantly increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 compared to those with heterozygous and wild-type^13^. *ABCB1* c.3435C > T altered expression levels and transport efficiency in vitro and in vivo^14,15^. *ABCC2* c.3972T/T genotype was related with higher areas under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) of irinotecan, (7-ethyl-10-[4-*N*-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin) (APC) and SN-38G^16^. *ABCG2* c.421C > A variant results in lower protein expression and higher drug exposure^17^. Clinically, the combination of irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil is frequently used to treat colorectal cancer patients, and *DPYD* polymorphisms are related to 5-fluorouracil-induced severe neutropenia and diarrhea^18^.

Although there have been reports of the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and irinotecan induced-toxicity, there are few reports in Thai colorectal cancer patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to extensively investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in *CYP3A4/5*, *DPYD*, *UGT1A1*, *ABCB1*, *ABCC2*, and *ABCG2* and irinotecan induced-toxicity in cohort of Thai colorectal cancer patient.

## Methods

### Eligible patients

A total of 132 metastatic colorectal cancer patients who received chemotherapy were recruited in this retro- and prospective study between August 2012 and June 2016 from the Division of Cancer, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand. The clinical eligibility criteria that was used to enroll patients were as follows: histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer; age at least 18 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–2; life expectancy > 3 months; neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 10^9^/L; platelet count ≥ 8 × 10^10^/L; serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 upper limit normal (ULN); total bilirubin ≤ 1.25 ULN; alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 ULN. All patients had peripheral blood samples taken and complete clinical information (Supplementary Table [1](#MOESM1)).

### Toxicity criteria

Toxicity was assessed at first and second cycles of treatment according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Grade 3–4 toxicity was considered as severe toxicity.

### Statistical analysis

Deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was assessed using Fisher’s exact and chi-square test. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined by direct counting. Comparisons of allele and genotype frequencies and grades of toxicity were performed using the χ^2^ test. Mann–Whitney U test was performed according to difference of genetic groups and nonparametric data [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir and ANC ratio]. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess univariate and multivariate relationships genetic polymorphisms, and other parameters. All statistics were calculated using SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and differences were significant when *P* values were < 0.05.

### Association between genetic polymorphisms and irinotecan-induced neutropenia

The association analysis is summarized in Table [3](#Tab3). At the first cycle of treatment, *ABCC2* c.3972C > T was significantly associated with all grades neutropenia [grade 1–4 neutropenia; odds ratio (OR) 3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.3–7; *P* < 0.012]. In addition, *UGT1A1***6* was significantly associated with grade 1–4 and severe neutropenia (grade 3–4) (OR 20.3, 95% CI 4.3–95.6; *P* < 0.001, and OR 4, 95% CI 1.2–13; *P* < 0.026, respectively). Although there were no significant differences between grade 3–4 neutropenia and patients with *UGT1A1*28*, the incidence of severe neutropenia in patients with hetero- and homozygous **28* was higher than patients with homozygous wild type, (OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.8–8.8; *P* = 0.087).

Table 3 Caption: Genetic polymorphisms associated with neutropenia in first and second cycles (N = 66).

At the second cycle, an association was observed between *UGT1A1*28* and grade 1–4 neutropenia (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–7.97; *P* = 0.017). Similarly, *UGT1A1***6* was significantly associated with grade 1–4 (OR 20.3, 95% CI 4.3–95.6; *P* < 0.001) and severe neutropenia (OR 12.5, 95% CI 3.4–45.7; *P* < 0.001).

The combination of *UGT1A1*28* and **6* showed a significant increased risk for all grades of neutropenia (*P* < 0.001) and severe neutropenia (*P* = 0.002) at first cycle. Similarly in the second cycle, patients with hetero- and homozygous variant had a high incidence of all grades of neutropenia (*P* < 0.001) and severe neutropenia (*P* = 0.016).

A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the influence of *CYP3A4*1B*, *CYP3A4*18*, *CYP3A5*3*, *DPYD*2A*, *DPYD*5*, *DPYD* c.1774C > T, *UGT1A1*28*, *UGT1A1*6*, *ABCB1* c.1236C > T, *ABCB1* c.3435C > T, *ABCC2* c.3972C > T, and *ABCG2* c.421C > A on neutropenia (all grades and severe neutropenia) at first and second cycles. The result showed that *ABCC2* c.3972C > T was significantly associated with grade 1–4 neutropenia (*P* = 0.015). In the second cycle, we found patients with *UGT1A1*28* were at significant increased risk for grade 1–4 neutropenia compared with wild type patients (*P* = 0.011). Moreover, patients with *UGT1A1*6* were at significantly increased risk for grades 1–4 and severe neutropenia compared with wild type patients (*P* = 0.002, *P* = 0.001, respectively), as shown in Table [4](#Tab4).

The association of genetic polymorphisms and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir was also assessed at the first and second cycle. Regarding *UGT1A1*6*, the ANC nadir of G/A was significantly lower than A/A in both first (1,600:2,560.7/mm^3^, *P* = 0.004) and second (1,201.8:2,379.8/mm^3^, *P* < 0.001) cycles. Hetero- and homozygous *UGT1A1*28* or **6* carriers showed decreased ANC nadir compared to wild type carriers at first (1,595.9:2,894.1/mm^3^, *P* < 0.001) and second 1,528.4:2,793/mm^3^, *P* = 0.001) cycles (Fig. [2](#Fig2)).

## Discussion

In this study, the association between irinotecan-induced toxicity and pharmacogenetics of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters was investigated. Our results showed that combined analysis of *UGT1A1*28* and **6* polymorphisms and *ABCC2* c.3972C > T were closely related with neutropenia toxicity in Thai colorectal cancer patients.

The *UGT1A1*28* allele is the most important risk factor for severe neutropenia or diarrhea. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed that patients with homozygous *UGT1A1*28* are at increased risk of severe neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan treatment^20^. Several studies have investigated the relationship of *UGT1A1*28* and severe neutropenia and diarrhea during irinotecan treatment^21–23^. Wang et al*.*^24^ reported a significantly high risk for grade 3–4 leukopenia and neutropenia in patients carrying heterozygous *UGT1A1*28* compared to homozygous wild type patients. Similarly, Rouits et al*.*^25^ reported that patients carrying the homozygous or heterozygous *UGT1A1*28* had significantly higher risk of neutropenia than those with *UGT1A1*1*. In this study, although there were no significant differences between grade 3–4 neutropenia and patients with *UGT1A1*28*, the incidence of severe neutropenia in patients with hetero- and homozygous **28* was higher than patients with homozygous wild type at the first cycle (OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.8–8.8; *P* = 0.087). At the second cycle, patient carried *UGT1A1*28* was a significantly higher risk of neutropenia than patients with homozygous wild type (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–7.97; *P* = 0.017). A multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the influence of *UGT1A1*28*. This result shown that patients with *UGT1A1*28* was at significant increased risk for grade 1–4 neutropenia compared with wild type patients (*P* = 0.011) in second cycle. Using ANC ratio, patient carried heterozygous and homozygous *UGT1A1*28* had lower ANC nadir and ANC ratio than wild type at first cycle (*P* = 0.047). These results shown an increased risk of neutropenia in patient with *UGT1A1*28* genotype.

The prevalence of *UGT1A1*6* in Asian is higher than Caucasian population. The *UGT1A1*6* polymorphism is the most common allele that is correlated with reduced SN-38 glucuronidation activity and drug toxicity^26^. Han et al*.*^27^ demonstrated that *UGT1A1*6/*6* was significantly associated with higher SN-38 AUC and may increase the risk for toxicities. Onoue et al*.*^28^ performed a prospective study of 135 Japanese cancer patients treated with irinotecan, and found that severe neutropenia was highly correlated with homozygous *UGT1A1*6* in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Similarly, *UGT1A1***6* was significantly associated with grade 1–4 and severe neutropenia at the first and second cycles in this study. In contrast, there were significant differences between grade 1–4 neutropenia and patients with *UGT1A1*28* at the second cycle. However, *UGT1A1* genotype was associated with an increased risk of grade 1–4 and severe neutropenia at the first and second cycle. Similar to the study by Yang et al.^29^, *UGT1A1*28* and **6* were significantly associated with higher incidence of grade 3–4 neutropenia. A meta-analysis by Han et al.^30^ found that Asian cancer patients with *UGT1A1*28* and **6* are at increased risk of irinotecan-induced neutropenia. Moreover, we also found an association between *UGT1A1*28* or/and *UGT1A1*6* and ANC nadir. This revealed that patients carrying variant of *UGT1A1* genotype had a significantly lower ANC nadir in the first and second cycle. Moriya et al*.*^31^ reported that ANC nadir in patients carrying *UGT1A1*6/*28*, **6/*6* were significantly lower compared with those with **1/*1*.

ABCC2 protein is expressed in liver, kidney, and small intestine, and also plays a primary role in biliary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites^32,33^. Interestingly, our result suggested that *ABCC2* c.3972C > T is associated with grade 1–4 neutropenia at the first cycle. Multivariate analysis indicated that *ABCC2* c.3972C > T is a risk factor for the occurrence of grade 1–4 neutropenia at the first cycle in patients who receive irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Innocenti et al.^16^ reported that *ABCC2* c.3972T/T genotype correlates with higher AUC of irinotecan, APC, and SN-38G. This result suggests that *ABCC2* c.3972C > T is associated with decreased hepatobiliary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites.

*ABCB1* c.3435C > T is associated with significantly lower AUC SN-38G levels, and homozygous *ABCB1* c.3435T/T may be related to higher P-glycoprotein (MDR1) activity^34^. However, *ABCB1* c.3435C > T was not associated with irinotecan induced severe neutropenia and diarrhea in Chinese cancer patients who received irinotecan chemotherapy^35^. Cote et al.^36^ reported that no statistically significant difference was found in *ABCB1* c.3435C > T polymorphism and occurrence of severe hematologic toxicity or severe neutropenia.

The *ABCB1* c.1236C > T has been reported to be associated with increased AUC of irinotecan and SN-38 in Caucasian cancer patients^13^, and *ABCB1* c.1236T/T had significantly higher plasma irinotecan and SN-38 concentrations than C/C or C/T. However, Han et al.^34^ reported that no significant effect of *ABCB1* c.1236C > T on irinotecan or its metabolites concentrations. Han et al.^27^ reported that no significant association between *ABCB1* c.1236C > T and severe neutropenia and diarrhea was observed. In vitro studies have shown that ABCG2, an efflux drug transporter, had a higher affinity with SN-38 and SN-38G^37^, and *ABCG2* c.421C > A is related with reduced expression of ABCG2 protein and transporter activity. However, de Jong et al*.*^38^ reported that no significant changes in irinotecan pharmacokinetics relative to the *ABCG2* c.421C > A in Caucasian cancer patients. *ABCG2* variants had no effect on SN-38 exposure or ANC nadir in 78 irinotecan-treated patients^39^.

Irinotecan is converted by CYP3A4/5 to APC metabolite in the liver, and correlation between these genes and irinotecan induced-toxicity found in this study may be due to low allele frequency of *CYP3A4*1B* and **18* in sampled population^40^. Similarly, Han et al*.*^34^ did not find any significant association between *CYP3A5*3* and toxicity.

The 5-FU-based regimen may cause neutropenia, however, over 80% of 5-FU is metabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in the liver^41^. *DPYD* variants may be related to severe 5-FU-associated toxicities. *DPYD*2A* and c.1774 C > T variants were not found in this study. Even though, the variant allele of *DPYD*5* had a frequency of 0.19, there was no association between *DPYD*5* and hematological toxicities.

A retrospective study design and small sample size are limitations of this study. A prospective study involving larger numbers of patients should confirm our study hypothesis. Secondly, rare genetic variants and multiple genes play a role in the irinotecan pathway. Those variants were not considered in our study. Lastly, non-hematologic toxicity (especially severe diarrhea) was not assesses in our study.

In conclusion, combination of *UGT1A1*28* and **6* and *ABCC2* c.3972C > T genotype are associated with the occurrence of grade 1–4 and severe neutropenia in Thai patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who receive irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that *UGT1A1* genotype and *ABCC2* c.3972C > T might be an important predictor for irinotecan induced-toxicity.
