We genotyped VDR polymorphisms and determined their associations with intestinal CYP3A4 and with midazolam pharmacokinetics, and whether intestinal CYP3A4 levels/activity varied seasonally. The VDR BsmIG>A (rs1544410) polymorphism was significantly associated with CYP3A4 jejunal expression/activity, withCYP3A4 duodenal mRNA, and with midazolam area under the curve (AUC). Intestinal CYP3A4 expression/activity was significantly higher in biopsies with the VDR promoter polymorphisms Cdx2-3731G>A and GATA-1012A>G that increase VDR activation of target genes. Duodenal CYP3A4 mRNA was significantly higher between April and September than between October and March. Midazolam p.o. AUC and oral bioavailability trended higher October through March compared to April through September. These data suggest VDR polymorphisms are predictors of intestinal CYP3A4, and that CYP3A4 intestinal expression varies seasonally - likely related to annual changes in UV sunlight and vitamin D levels.\n\nKeywords: CYP3A4, vitamin D, VDR, polymorphism, seasonal variation\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nCYP3A4 is highly expressed in human duodenal and jejunal mucosal epithelium [[1](#R1), [2](#R2)]. Inter-individual differences in intestinal CYP3A4 expression and activity contribute significantly to the low and variable oral bioavailability for many CYP3A4 drug substrates. For example, it was estimated that intestinal CYP3A4 catalyzes the first pass loss of >40% (on average) of an oral dose of midazolam [[3](#R3), [4](#R4)]. Moreover, for midazolam, the extent of intestinal first-pass extraction can vary between negligible to as much as 75% [[4](#R4)]. This result is consistent with the more than 20-fold inter-individual differences in CYP3A4 content in human duodenal enterocytes [[5](#R5)–[7](#R7)]. These findings have important therapeutic implications because the large inter-patient differences in first-pass intestinal extraction efficiency leads to differences in systemic exposure to the parent drug and its metabolites. These differences are important determinants of drug efficacy and toxicity, and hence therapeutic outcome after oral drug administration.\n\nInter-individual differences in intestinal CYP3A4 expression are likely governed by both genetic and environmental factors. However, numerous studies have revealed that CYP3A4 cis-nucleotide variation cannot fully explain variable CYP3A4 expression in liver, or the oral or intravenous clearance of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam [[8](#R8)]. Genetic variation in liver-enriched transcription factors (e.g., PXR and FoxA2) regulating CYP3A4 expression appears to explain some of the variability in hepatic CYP3A4 expression [[9](#R9), [10](#R10)]. This suggests that genetic variation in transcription factors governing intestinal CYP3A4 expression might contribute to inter-individual differences in gut CYP3A4 expression.\n\nThere are multiple lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that CYP3A4 intestinal expression is highly regulated by the biologically active form of vitamin D3 (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3)). Treatment of intestinal cells with VD3 increases CYP3A4 expression [[11](#R11)]. CYP3A4 transcription is induced by VD3 activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR) which binds to proximal elements in the CYP3A4 promoter [[12](#R12)] and distal ER6 and CLEM4 ER6 response element [[13](#R13), [14](#R14)] to induce CYP3A4 transcription. *In vivo*, treatment of rats and mice with VD3 increases intestinal CYP3A protein expression and activity [[7](#R7)]. Likewise, humans treated with vitamin D supplementation show a decreased AUC and increased clearance of the CYP3A substrate atorvastatin [[15](#R15)]. Finally, it was recently shown that blood levels of tacrolimus and sirolimus showed striking seasonal variation that correlated with documented levels of ultraviolet light and serum vitamin D3 levels [[16](#R16)] further supporting the role of the vitamin D receptor as an important regulator of human intestinal CYP3A expression.\n\nIn the present study we tested the hypothesis that common *VDR* polymorphisms, each previously associated with VDR expression/function *in vitro* and *in vivo*, would be associated with intestinal CYP3A4 expression and activity, and further that intestinal CYP3A4 expression and midazolam disposition *in vivo* would show seasonal variation correlating with the documented seasonal availability of ultraviolet light and vitamin D levels.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Populations\n\nInstitutional Review Boards at the University of Washington approved the use of tissue samples from organ donors, and at the University of Indiana approved the midazolam study protocols, and at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital approved genotyping of DNA from anonymous subjects. The Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at the University of Western Ontario approved the study protocol.\n\n### 2.2. Human Jejunal Mucosa Cohort\n\nHuman jejunal mucosa cohort (n=30) from White donorswas obtained from the University of Washington School of Pharmacy Human Tissue Bank (Seattle, WA). Both intestinal and hepatic tissues (below) were obtained through the solid organ donation program operated by Life Center Northwest, following informed consent by the family for use of the tissues for research. Demographic information for the jejunal and liver donors (below) and detailed methods of CYP3A4 protein immunoquantitation and activity, as measured by midazolam hydroxylation, have been described earlier [[17](#R17)]. Unfortunately, it was not possible to measure VDR protein in these samples. The considerable measures taken to ensure cellular viability and preserve CYP protein and activity from tissue harvest to freezing has been extensively detailed previously [[1](#R1), [17](#R17)]. Anecdotally, we have found no evidence of CYP3A4 protein and mRNA degradation in the frozen, banked tissue samples when measured periodically over the last 15 years.\n\n### 2.3. Human Liver Cohort\n\nHuman liver cohort (n=54) from White donors was obtained from the University of Washington School of Pharmacy Human Tissue Bank (Seattle, WA). All subjects’ families provided written informed consent prior to tissue procurement. The considerable measures taken to ensure cellular viability and preserve CYP protein and activity from tissue harvest to freezing have been extensively detailed previously [[17](#R17)]. The amount of CYP3A4 protein, midazolam hydroxylase activity, and CYP3A5 genotypes have been previously described [[17](#R17)].\n\n### 2.4. Human Duodenal Biopsy Cohort\n\nHuman duodenal biopsy cohortfrom White donors consisted of 45 subjects. The mean age was 53.1 +/− 14.7 years (range 18 – 78). A single four-milliliter blood sample was collected on the day of the procedure for DNA extraction using a DNA blood midi extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Duodenal biopsies were obtained from healthy subjects undergoing diagnostic esophagogastro-duodenoscopy at the London Health Sciences Centre – Victoria Campus as part of their medical care, and who were invited to participate in the study. No subject gave more than a single biopsy. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to sample procurement. During the subject’s scheduled endoscopic procedure, an additional pinch biopsy was collected from the duodenum at or slightly distal to the ampulla of Vater. The Pathologists reviewing the slides of these biopsies indicated they are all histologically normal.\n\n### 2.5. Duodenal CYP3A4 Expression\n\nThe duodenal specimen was immediately placed in RNA*later* according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at −80°C until analysis. Tissue was homogenized and RNA extracted in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following standard methods. The cDNA synthesis was performed with 500 ng of RNA. Quantitative RT-PCR for CYP3A4 was performed using a SYBR green assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the following primers: 5′-CAGGAGGAAATTGATGCAGTTTT-3′ (forward), and 5′-GTCAAGATACTCCATCTGTAGCACAGT-3′ (reverse). All samples were compared to a standard curve of the CYP3A4 amplicon, which was sub-cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO^®^ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for quantitative determination of copy number.\n\n### 2.6. Midazolam (MDZ) Clearance Cohort\n\nA total of 86 MDZ levels were available from 62 Whites (complete demographics described previously [[8](#R8)]). Forty-three Whites had a single measure, and nineteen Whites had repeated measures. Study design for *in vivo* midazolam phenotyping from multiple clinical trials has previously been described in detail [[8](#R8)]. Briefly, in each study single-dose MDZ was administrated both i.v. (intravenously) and p.o. (by mouth). In five studies, subjects were simultaneously administered a single i.v. dose (0.05 mg/kg over 30 minutes) of MDZ and an oral dose of ^15^N-MDZ (3 mg) after an overnight fast. In the additional two studies, oral MDZ (4 mg) was administered 24 hrs after the i.v. dose. All drugs and food known to affect CYP3A activity were prohibited before and for the duration of the studies. For each subject, blood samples for MDZ concentrations were obtained over a period of 12 to 24 hours. Weight-corrected p.o. clearance, dose adjusted p.o. area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and bioavailability (F) were used as MDZ PK parameters, since dosages were different in these clinical trials and body size appears to be an important determinant of between-subject variability.\n\n### 2.7. Genotyping for VDR Polymorphisms\n\nWe genotyped *VDR* polymorphisms rs1544410 (intron 8 *Bsm*I-G>A), rs7975232 (intron 8 *Apa*I-T>G), rs731236 (exon 9 *Taq*I-T>C), rs2228570 (exon 2 *Fok*IT>C), rs11568820 (Cdx2-3731G>A) and rs4516035 (GATA-1012A>G). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood using the DNA blood midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified by Pico Green assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and was utilized to determine genotypes. Many of the genotypes were determined by direct DNA sequencing (Hartwell Center) and Taqman Allelic Discrimination Assays. Alternatively, genomic DNA was amplified using primers (St Jude Hartwell Center, Memphis, TN) and conditions listed in [Table 1](#T1). The PCR products were digested with the selective restriction enzymes.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| SNP ID | Genotyping Method | Assay Detail |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| rs2228570 | RFLP | FW 5′-AGCTGGCCCTGGCACTGACTCTGCTCT-3′ |\n| FokI T>C |   | RV 5′-ATGGAAACACCTTGCTTCTTCTCCCTC-3′ |\n| g.30920T>C |   | Annealing: 58°C |\n| E2-T4C |   | Digest: FokI, 37°C for 2 hours |\n|   |  |  |\n| rs1544410 | RFLP | FW 5′-CAACCAAGACTACAAGTACCGCGTCAGTG-3′ |\n| BsmI G>A |   | RV 5′-AACCAGCGGGAAGAGGTCAAGGG-3′ |\n| g.63980G>A |   | Annealing: 60°C |\n| E8-G+284A |   | Digest: BsmI, 65°C for 2 hours |\n|   |  |  |\n| rs7975232 | RFLP | FW 5′-CAACCAAGACTACAAGTACCGCGTCAGTG-3′ |\n| ApaI T>G |   | RV 5′-CACTTCGAGCACAAGGGGCGTTAGC-3′ |\n| g.64978T>G |   | Annealing: 65°C |\n| E9-T-48G |   | Digest: ApaI, 37°C for 2 hours |\n|   |  |  |\n| rs731236 | RFLP | FW 5′-CAACCAAGACTACAAGTACCGCGTCAGTG-3′ |\n| TaqI T>C |   | RV 5′-CACTTCGAGCACAAGGGGCGTTAGC-3′ |\n| g.65058T>C |   | Annealing: 65°C |\n| E9-T32C |   | Digest: TaqI, 65°C for 2 hours |\n|   |  |  |\n| rs4516035 | TaqMan Assay | Assay ID C___2880805_10 |\n| GATA-1012 A>G |   |   |\n|   |  |  |\n| rs11568820 | TaqMan Assay | Assay ID C___2880808_10 |\n| Cdx2-3731G>A |   |   |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Methods used to genotype VDR polymorphisms.\n\n### 2.8. Statistical Analysis\n\nOnly White subjects were used in all studies. Samples from the duodenum and jejunum were not gender stratified before genotype/CYP3A phenotype analysis because gender had no effect on intestinal CYP3A4 protein expression or activity [[6](#R6)]. Midazolam PK measures were not gender stratified because oral dose-adjusted AUC and bioavailability were not different between men and women [[8](#R8)]. *In Vivo* MDZ PK data was not corrected for CYP3A5 expressor/non-expressor or *CYP3A4***1B* genotypes because it was previously determined, in these exact same samples, that there were no significant differences in MDZ PK parameters between genotypes [[8](#R8)]. To date, there is no good explanation for the lack of genotype-phenotype concordance for the effect of CYP3A5 expression on MDZ metabolism *in vitro* but not *in vivo* [[8](#R8)]. In the midazolam cohort, if a subject contributed more than one sample, the sample average value was used to avoid overweighting of subjects with repeated sampling. The Chi-squared test for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was used to calculate the observed versus expected distribution of genotypes. Because the phenotypic markers were not normally distributed, group differences were analyzed nonparametrically using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, which is more robust against outliers, to compare binary groups (e.g., GG +GT versus TT). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare three groups of genotype for each polymorphism (e.g., GG versus GT versus TT) with the phenotype.\n\nTo test for seasonal differences, the months were grouped into the six months with the highest (April through September) and the lowest (October through March) historical average daily UV-B Index in Western Ontario and Indiana regions [[18](#R18), [19](#R19)]. The Wilcoxon rank sum testwas used to test for seasonal differences in duodenal CYP3A4 mRNA expression. To evaluate seasonal effects for the midazolam cohort, if the subject had more than one observation in the same season, the median value was used, an accepted statistical approach [[16](#R16)]. If the subject had more than one observation, but in different seasons, all individual values were included. Thus, each subject would have one unique measurement for each phenotype, unless he/she were measured in both seasons. We then applied the Wilcoxon rank sum test to evaluate the seasonal difference. All the statistical calculations were performed using program R (version 2.8.1): A Language and Environment for Statistical Analysis ([http://www.Rproject.org](http://www.Rproject.org)). Unfortunately, neither the duodenum nor midazolam cohorts were large enough to stratify by VDR genotype first in order to test for significant gene/environment (season) interactions.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. The VDR BsmI polymorphism is significantly associated with intestinal CYP3A4 expression and activity in multiple White cohorts\n\nWe genotyped *VDR* polymorphisms rs1544410 (intron 8 *Bsm*I-G>A), and rs7975232 (intron 8 *Apa*I-T>G), and rs731236 (exon 9 *Taq*I-T>C) because these SNPs, and their associated RFLPs, have been extensively tested for their association with multiple VDR regulated traits [[20](#R20)]. The *VDR Bsm*I genotype was significantly associated with jejunalCYP3A4 protein levels (AA: 3.8 ± 9.1< AG: 12.3 ± 11.5< GG: 21.2 ± 8.0 pmol/mg homogenate; Kruskal Wallis p=0.04) ([Fig 1](#F1)); and with CYP3A4 midazolam hydroxylation (AA: 67.4 ± 65.1 < GA: 154.8 ± 117.5 < GG: 230.6 ± 126.8 pmol/mg homogenate; Kruskal Wallis p=0.04) ([Fig 1](#F1)). CYP3A5 is polymorphically expressed in human intestine [[17](#R17)]. VDR is known to induce intestinal CYP3A4 [[12](#R12)], but is not expected to regulate CYP3A5 since CYP3A5 lacks many of the VDR response elements, and is not an inducible member of the CYP3A family [[12](#R12)]. Hence, we did not test for association of VDR genotype with CYP3A5 expression. However, since CYP3A5 expression clearly affects midazolam hydroxylation *in vitro* [[12](#R12)], we determined the effect of VDR polymorphisms on MDZ hydroxylation in jejunum homogenates with and without CYP3A5 in our analysis. The association between CYP3A4 activity and *VDR* genotype remained significant even after removing CYP3A5 expressers (p=0.04).\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c968/3774043/0f3f091664c8/nihms371896f1.jpg)\n\nThe VDR BsmI polymorphism is associated with intestinal CYP3A4 phenotypes in White subjects. Jejunal CYP3A4 protein expression (expressed as pmoles CYP3A4 protein normalized for total protein content in a homogenate of jejunal mucosa) and midazolam1′-OH hydroxylation activity, duodenal CYP3A4 mRNA expression, and MDZ AUC association with VDR BsmI G>A rs1544410 genotypes (listed at the bottom of each cohort panel). Box plots indicate 1st and third quartiles, bold interior line within boxes represent median values, bars represent ranges after outliers were excluded, and circles outside of boxes represent outliers. The p value results from the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test is shown for comparing the significance between the three genotypes. n= number of subjects.\n\nA similar result was seen in duodenal biopsies from White donors ([Fig 1](#F1)) with CYP3A4 mRNA expression levels corresponding with *Bsm*I genotype (GG>GA>AA). Subjects with at least one *Bsm*I-A allele had significantly lower intestinal CYP3A4 mRNA levels as compared to *Bsm*I-G homozygous subjects ([Fig 1](#F1)). The *Taq*I and *Apa*I polymorphisms, in partial LD with the *Bsm*I polymorphism [[21](#R21)], showed a less significant association with intestinal CYP3A4 expression and activity (p=0.05).\n\nNext we took advantage of unique samples in which midazolam, a drug selectively metabolized by CYP3A to its primary metabolite, 1′-hydroxymidazolam, was administered orally and intravenously. The apparent clearance of orally administered MDZ is recognized as a biomarker of intestinal CYP3A and hepatic CYP3A activities, while the intravenous MDZ reflects predominantly hepatic CYP3A. The simultaneous p.o./iv administration of MDZ was previously used to examine the individual contribution of intestinal CYP3A to metabolism [[8](#R8)]. Consistent with *Bsm*I GG subjects having *higher* intestinal levels of CYP3A ([Fig 1](#F1)) and a more rapid weight adjusted oral clearance of midazolam (p=0.05), the dose adjusted midazolam oral AUC was *lower* in subjects with the *VDR Bsm*I-G genotype. This inverse relationship is exactly what would be expected since higher intestinal CYP3A4 would be associated with higher CL/F, but lower bioavailability and AUC.\n\n### 3.2. VDR genotypes are not associated with hepatic CYP3A4\n\nWe hypothesized that the *VDR* genotypes would be associated with intestinal and not hepatic CYP3A4 expression because VDR is not highly expressed in human hepatocytes [[22](#R22)]. We *VDR* genotyped human livers from 54 White donors that had previously been phenotyped for CYP3A4 protein expression and activity, and that were all CYP3A5 non-expressors [[17](#R17)]. There was no association of the *VDR Bsm*I genotype with hepatic CYP3A4 protein expression or midazolam 1′-hydroxylase activity (p= 0.51). In addition, we tested for but found no significant association between the intravenous midazolam clearance and VDR *Bsm*I genotype (p>0.05). This result is consistent with the limited expression of VDR in the liver [[23](#R23)] and the lack of an association between hepatic CYP3A4 content measures and VDR *Bsm*I genotype.\n\n### 3.3. The FokI polymorphism was not associated with any CYP3A4 traits\n\nThe common rs2228570 (exon 2 *Fok*IT>C) was genotyped because it results in a three amino acid shorter VDR protein with reported higher transcriptional activity [[20](#R20)]. The *Fok*I RFLP has no LD with any of the other *VDR* SNPs or LD blocks [[21](#R21)], and was not associated with intestinal CYP3A4 (p>0.05).\n\n### 3.4. VDR promoter polymorphisms are associated with intestinal CYP3A4 expression and activity in White subjects\n\nWe genotyped for *VDR* promoter polymorphisms rs11568820 (Cdx2-3731G>A) and rs4516035 (GATA-1012A>G) because these affect binding sites for Cdx2 and GATA, respectively, and *VDR* transcriptional activity [[24](#R24), [25](#R25)]. CYP3A4 jejunal protein ([Fig 2](#F2)) and activity (p=0.03) were higher in subjects with the GATA-A genotype (that creates a *VDR* promoter GATA binding site) [[24](#R24)] and were higher in subjects with the Cdx2-A alleles (that increases Cdx2 binding to the *VDR* promoter) [[25](#R25)] ([Fig 2](#F2)), and with the combined GATA/Cdx2 A/A genotype. Consistent with this finding, the midazolam AUC was lower in those subjects who had the GATA-A and Cdx2-A promoter genotypes ([Fig 2](#F2)). Surprisingly, the CYP3A4 mRNA showed the opposite trend with higher mRNA in subjects with the GATA-G genotype ([Fig 2](#F2)).\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c968/3774043/41fd16fbc32c/nihms371896f2.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3774043_nihms371896f2.jpg)\n\nVDR promoter polymorphisms are associated with intestinal CYP3A4 phenotypes in White subjects.

Duodenal CYP3A4 mRNA expression and midazolam in vivo PK parameters show seasonal variation in expression\n\nBecause circulating levels of vitamin D are known to be directly related to seasonal levels of UV sunlight, we compared CYP3A4 expression monthly and by seasons in the subjects sampled in London, Ontario, Canada (latitude 42.97°N). Duodenal CYP3A4 mRNA levels showed month-to-month variation ([Fig 3](#F3)). Based on data published for historical UV-B levels across the upper mid-West and in Toronto [[18](#R18), [19](#R19)], the mean CYP3A4 levels were compared between the six months when surface UV-B irradiance was historically between 55–100% of maximum (April through September), and the six months when the UV-B surface irradiance levels were below these values (October through March). The mean CYP3A4 levels in the duodenum were highest in the six months with the highest documented levels of UV-B ([Fig 3](#F3)) and the difference was significant (p=0.01).\n\n### Fig. 3.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c968/3774043/34f16b9c0ff3/nihms371896f3.jpg)\n\nSeasonal variation in CYP3A4 duodenum expression in White donors. Box plots (described in Fig. 1) indicate the CYP3A4 mRNA expression in human duodenums grouped monthly (July and November had no individuals) (left panels) and grouped seasonally from April-Sept vs. October-March (right panels). The p value results from the Wilcoxon test are shown for the right panel comparing CYP3A4 mRNA expression in April–Sept vs. October–March.\n\nThere was a trend towards a decrease in midazolam dose adjusted AUC and oral bioavailability ([Fig 4](#F4)) in the six months with the highest UV-B levels in the upper Midwest [[18](#R18)] (April through September) compared to the six months with the lowest UV-B levels (October through March) in the subjects analyzed in Indianapolis, IN (latitude 39.77°N), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Unfortunately, neither the duodenum nor midazolam cohorts were large enough to stratify by VDR genotype first in order to test for significant gene/environment (season) interactions.\n\n### Fig. 4.\n\n![Fig. 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c968/3774043/ab5e020d5020/nihms371896f4.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3774043_nihms371896f4.jpg)\n\nSeasonal variation in oral midazolam pharmacokinetic parameters in White subjects.

N.S. = no significant difference observed under the 5% significance level.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nAlthough it has been suggested that nearly all of the observed differences in CYP3A catalyzed activity (~90%) can be attributed to genetic variation [[26](#R26)], there are relatively few examples where CYP3A cis-genetic variation has been definitively linked to differences in CYP3A dependent drug clearances *in vivo* [[9](#R9), [10](#R10), [27](#R27)]. In this study we tested the hypothesis that VDR genetic variation was related to CYP3A4 intestinal expression and activity. Our investigation revealed that the same *VDR* genotypes predictive of CYP3A4 expression in human duodenum and jejunum were also associated with oral disposition of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. These results add to our growing understanding of the genetic determinants of intestinal CYP3A4 expression and individual differences in first pass intestinal extraction efficiency following oral administration of CYP3A4 substrates.\n\nThe *VDR Bsm*I polymorphism, in particular, showed association with CYP3A4 intestinal expression/activity (*Bsm*I-G allele = higher CYP3A4 expression). The *VDR Bsm*I RFLP, in combination with the *Apa*I, *Taq*I RFLPs, that are in partial LD in Whites [[21](#R21)], have been used extensively in association studies with multiple VDR regulated traits, including bone mineral density and risk of osteoporosis [[20](#R20), [28](#R28)]. The relationship of the *Bsm*I RFLP to bone density is controversial with some groups finding increased bone density while others have found reduced bone density [[28](#R28)].\n\nThe Cdx2-3731A and GATA-1012A (upstream of exon 1a) promoter genotypes, particularly in combination, were associated with higher CYP3A4 intestinal expression/activity. Although *VDR* uses multiple promoters, the 1a promoter is transcriptionally the most active [[29](#R29)]. Both Cdx2 and GATA are intestinal transcription factors important for regional differences in expression of genes along the small intestine [[30](#R30)]. Cdx2 is expressed at higher levels in the distal compared with the proximal small intestine. In contrast, GATA4 is expressed as a gradient from highest in duodenum to absent in ileum [[31](#R31)]. The regional differences in the ratios of Cdx2/GATA4 in duodenum and jejunum may help explain the surprising finding that the *VDR* Cdx2 promoter SNP was associated with higher jejunal, but lower duodenal, CYP3A4 expression ([Fig 2](#F2)). These promoter genotypes appear directly associated with VDR expression levels because, compared with the -3731 Cdx2-A allele, the -3731Cdx2-G allele leads to a decrease in Cdx transactivation of the *VDR* exon 1a promoter and is associated with a 10% decrease in spinal bone mineral density in Japanese women [[24](#R24)]. Similarly, we found that CYP3A4 jejunal levels were lower in intestines with the Cdx2-G allele. The VDR -1012A GATA+ (but not -1012G GATA-) genotype binds GATA in electromobility shift assays [[21](#R21)]. Correspondingly, in transfected cells, *VDR* promoter-reporter constructs containing the GATA-binding site had a 50% lower transcription rate compared with the GATA+ reporter plasmid [[21](#R21)]. These results suggest that the higher CYP3A4 expression in intestines with the *VDR*/GATA+ allele would correspond to greater GATA4 transactivation of the *VDR* promoter and correspondingly higher VDR levels in these intestines, although this was not formally tested. Importantly, the GATA- and -3731Cdx-2-G promoter polymorphisms are combined in a risk haplotype for fracture [[21](#R21)], and we found that CYP3A4 expression/activity was significantly lower in jejunums with the combined GATA−/−3731G genotype ([Fig 2](#F2)). The differences observed for midazolam clearance (50% higher CL/F for the *VDR* BsmI variant and 50% lower CL/F for the GATA variant) may not have clinical significance for midazolam because the drug is generally dosed to a desired pharmacological effect (sedation). However, these differences would be clinically meaningful for a narrow therapeutic index CYP3A substrate like tacrolimus, particularly if the extent of intestinal first-pass extraction is much higher than that of midazolam.\n\nAlthough there is considerable data supporting the role of VDR in regulating intestinal CYP3A4, the role for VDR in regulating hepatic CYP3A4 is more controversial and weak. Early reports found that VDR was only expressed in non-parenchymal cells and biliary epithelial cells and not in hepatocytes [[22](#R22)]. Some investigators have reported that VDR is expressed in isolated human hepatocytes [[32](#R32), [33](#R33)]. However, the expression level of VDR in rat liver is very low, about 0.1% compared to that in rat intestine [[23](#R23)]. Even greater differences in VDR mRNA content are found in intact human liver vs. intestine [[7](#R7), [34](#R34)]. Moreover, the magnitude of CYP3A4 mRNA induction reported in human liver slices by VD3 was only 2-fold (compared to 10-fold by dexamethasone, a relatively weak inducer of human CYP3A4) [[23](#R23)]. Finally, the *VDR Bsm*I polymorphism had no association with hepatic CYP3A4 expression (p= 0.51).\n\nLindh et al [[16](#R16)] recently demonstrated that dose adjusted blood levels of sirolimus and tacrolimus (CYP3A substrates) in patients in Stockholm, Sweden (59.17°N) were higher in winter months and lower in summer months, directly correlating with seasonal differences in UV sunlight levels and systemic vitamin D3 levels in Finland (64°N) and Sweden, respectively. However, it remained to be determined whether intestinal (or hepatic) CYP3A4 levels were similarly related to seasonal variation in UV sunlight. In addition, because the seasonal variation in the availability of UV light is much greater at the northern latitudes, and diminishes as one moves closer to the equator, it was unclear whether the results would be the same among persons living in lower latitudes. The results from this exploratory retrospective study clearly demonstrate that documented seasonal changes in UV sunlight around London, Ontario, Canada (latitude 42.97°N) [[18](#R18), [19](#R19)] correlated with human duodenal CYP3A4 levels. CYP3A4 intestinal expression was significantly higher in the six months with the highest historical UV-B levels compared to the six months with the lowest UV-B levels. The trend towards decreased midazolam oral bioavailability in the months with high UV-B levels around Indianapolis, IN (latitude 39.77°N) [[18](#R18)], and with higher intestinal CYP3A4, demonstrates that it is variation in intestinal CYP3A4, and not seasonal variation in CYP3A4 systemic/hepatic clearance, that is driving the apparent seasonal differences in midazolam oral bioavailability.\n\nWe acknowledge that a large prospective clinical study to simultaneously measure serum 25(OH)D blood levels and CYP3A4 pharmacokinetics is the gold standard. However, the availability of these unique retrospective samples from three separate human clinical studies of extensively CYP3A phenotyped samples allowed us to move immediately and rapidly forward in testing our hypothesis. We think this is a distinct advantage since, realistically, a prospective clinical trial would require 2+ years to run and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The significant association of intestinal CYP3A4 expression with seasonal variation in UV sunlight in the upper Midwest [[18](#R18), [19](#R19)] is notable since none of these studies was designed to test for this relationship and hence did not control for all of the potential confounders (e.g., vitamin D supplements or travel to areas with higher UV sunlight) that would affect average UV exposure/vitamin D levels.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that genetic variation in *VDR*, a direct transcriptional activator of intestinal CYP3A4, is associated with CYP3A4 duodenal and jejunal expression. Moreover, CYP3A4 intestinal expression varied seasonally, correlating with the documented levels of UV sunlight and reported seasonal levels of vitamin D. Hence, variation in VDR and its ligand appear to be primary determinants of individual variation in intestinal CYP3A4 expression. These results suggest that *VDR* genotypes may help explain individual differences in first pass intestinal extraction efficiency following oral administration of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4, and perhaps of other intestinal VDR regulated drug detoxification genes including P-glycoprotein and CYP2C9 [[35](#R35), [36](#R36)]. Our results support further testing for how seasonal, regional, racial and ethnic differences in vitamin D levels correlate with CYP3A4 mediated drug clearance. Comprehensive testing for *VDR* genotype/UV sunlight-vitamin D levels will require inclusion of larger populations but also more comprehensive, standardized, and precise approaches to capturing environmental information.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nFinancial Support: This work is supported in part by the NIH/NIGMS R01 GM094418, R01 GM063666, and P01 GM32165, the NIH/NIGMS Pharmacogenetics Research Network grant U01GM092666, the NIH P30 CA21765 Cancer Center Support grant and by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC).\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Jeremy Hunt and Praveen Potukuchi for genotyping assistance, Drs.

CES1 expression and activity vary markedly among individuals; and genetic variation is a major contributing factor to CES1 interindividual variability. In this study, we comprehensively examined the functions of CES1 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and haplotypes using transfected cell lines and individual human liver tissues. The 20 candidate variants include CES1 nsSNPs with a minor allele frequency >0.5% in a given population or located in close proximity to the CES1 active site. Five nsSNPs, including L40Ter (rs151291296), G142E (rs121912777), G147C (rs146456965), Y170D (rs148947808), and R171C (rs201065375), were loss-of-function variants for metabolizing the CES1 substrates clopidogrel, enalapril, and sacubitril. In addition, A158V (rs202121317), R199H (rs2307243), E220G (rs200707504), and T290M (rs202001817) decreased CES1 activity to a lesser extent in a substrate-dependent manner. Several nsSNPs, includingL40Ter (rs151291296), G147C (rs146456965), Y170D (rs148947808), and R171C (rs201065375), significantly reduced CES1 protein and/or mRNA expression levels in the transfected cells. Functions of the common nonsynonymous haplotypes D203E-A269S and S75N-D203E-A269S were evaluated using cells stably expressing the haplotypes and a large set of the human liver. Neither CES1 expression nor activity was affected by the two haplotypes. In summary, this study revealed several functional nsSNPs with impaired activity on the metabolism of CES1 substrate drugs. Clinical investigations are warranted to determine whether these nsSNPs can serve as biomarkers for the prediction of therapeutic outcomes of drugs metabolized by CES1.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCarboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is the most abundant drug-metabolizing enzyme in the human liver ([Achour et al., 2017](#B1)), contributing to 80%–95% of total hepatic hydrolytic activity ([Imai, 2006](#B5)). CES1 is responsible for the metabolism of a wide range of therapeutic agents, endogenous compounds, and environmental toxins ([Laizure et al., 2013](#B6)). Of particular clinical relevance, CES1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of numerous clinically important medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prodrugs ([Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)), clopidogrel (Plavix; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) ([Zhu et al., 2013](#B32)), sacubitril (Entresto; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) ([Shi et al., 2016b](#B18)), methylphenidate (Ritalin; Novartis) ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31)), oseltamivir (Tamiflu; Genentech, San Francisco, CA) ([Shi et al., 2016a](#B17)), and dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT) ([Laizure et al., 2014](#B7); [Shi et al., 2016c](#B19)). Marked interindividual variability in CES1 expression and activity has been well documented ([Hosokawa et al., 1995](#B4); [Shi et al., 2006](#B16); [Yoshimura et al., 2008](#B27); [Hagihara et al., 2009](#B3); [Yang et al., 2009](#B26); [Zhu et al., 2009a](#B28); [Ross et al., 2012](#B14)), which may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs metabolized by CES1. Genetic polymorphisms are increasingly recognized as an important factor contributing to CES1 variability and varied responses to CES1 substrate drugs ([Geshi et al., 2005](#B2); [Zhu et al., 2008](#B31); [Nemoda et al., 2009](#B10); [Sai et al., 2010](#B15); [Rasmussen et al., 2015](#B13); [Tarkiainen et al., 2015a](#B22)). For example, the *CES1* nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) G143E (rs71647871) was associated with diminishing CES1 activity on metabolizing several CES1 substrate drugs, including methylphenidate ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31); [Nemoda et al., 2009](#B10); [Stage et al., 2017](#B20)), oseltamivir ([Zhu and Markowitz, 2009](#B30); [Tarkiainen et al., 2012](#B21)), enalapril ([Tarkiainen et al., 2015b](#B23); [Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)), clopidogrel ([Lewis et al., 2013](#B8); [Tarkiainen et al., 2015a](#B22)), dabigatran etexilate ([Shi et al., 2016c](#B19)), and sacubitril ([Shi et al., 2016b](#B18)). These findings indicate that *CES1* genetic variants may significantly impact responses to drugs metabolized by CES1.\n\nThe *CES1* gene is located on chromosome 16q13-q22.1 and is highly polymorphic, with >600 nsSNPs across its 14 exons. The frequencies of *CES1* nsSNPs vary markedly among different ethnic groups. Several nsSNPs were rare in Caucasians but common in other populations, including the variants T167S [rs147694791, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 5.48% in Africans], R186P [rs60054861, MAF = 12.39% in Africans], A158V [rs202121317, MAF = 6.69% in South Asians], and E220G [rs200707504, MAF = 3.1% in Koreans]. A recent in silico structure-based analysis predicted that eight *CES1* nsSNPs, including G142E (rs121912777), G143E (rs71647871), G147C (rs146456965), Q169P (rs143718310), Y170D (rs148947808), R171C (rs201065375), G173D (rs4784575), and E220G (rs200707504), reside within 5 Å from the enzyme active site ([Nzabonimpa et al., 2016](#B11)) and thus are likely to alter enzyme-substrate binding affinity. However, except for a very few variants that have a relatively high MAF in Caucasians (e.g., G143E), the majority of *CES1* nsSNPs have not been thoroughly studied for their functional consequences.\n\nIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive in vitro functional study using transfected cell lines and individual human liver tissues to evaluate the functions of *CES1* nsSNPs that have a MAF >0.5% in a given population and the common haplotypes D203E-A269S and S75N-D203E-A269S. Furthermore, nsSNPs located in close proximity to the CES1 active site were also subjected to the functional study. This study revealed that several nsSNPs significantly impaired CES1 activity on the metabolism of the CES1 substrates enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril. The findings reinforce the notion that CES1 genetic variants play an important role in interindividual variability in response to medications metabolized by CES1.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Materials\n\nThe QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was purchased from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA). The products purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Co. (Waltham, MA) included the Flp-In-293 cell line, pOG44 plasmid, S.N.A.P. Plasmid DNA MiniPrep Kit, Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), Hygromycin B in phosphate-buffered saline (50 mg/ml) and a 100× antibiotics mixture containing penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 *μ*g/ml), Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%), the SILAC Protein Quantitation Kit-DMEM containing SILAC DMEM (deficient in arginine and lysine), ^13^C_6_ l-lysine-2HCl, ^13^C_6_^15^N_4_ l-arginine-HCl, dialyzed FBS, urea, dl-dithiothreitol, trifluoroacetic acid, TRIzol RNA isolation reagent, and acetonitrile. Iodoacetamide was from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ). L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corporation (Freehold, NJ). Water Oasis HLB columns were from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA). Recombinant CES1 (purity >95%) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).\n\nEnalapril maleate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The enalapril hydrolytic metabolite enalaprilat dehydrate was from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). *S*-(l)-clopidogrel and clopidogrel carboxylate were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, ON, Canada). Sacubitril was purchased from MedKoo Biosciences (Chapel Hill, NC). The active metabolite of sacubitril, LBQ657 (*γS*-[(3-carboxy-1-oxopropyl)amino]-*αR*-methyl-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-pentanoic acid), was obtained from our laboratory after incubation of 100 *μ*M sacubitril with 50 ng/*μ*l recombinant human CES1 at 37°C for 2 hours ([Shi et al., 2016b](#B18)). Sacubitril was completely hydrolyzed to LBQ657 after incubation as determined by liquid chromatography (LC)–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis ([Shi et al., 2016b](#B18)). The High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).\n\nA total of 104 individual normal human liver samples were obtained from XenoTech LLC (Lenexa, KS) and the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (Columbus, OH). The liver samples were from 48 men and 56 women aged 22–81 years. The donors included 94 Caucasians, six African Americans, two Hispanics, and two classified as “others.”\n\n### Establishment of Cell Lines Stably Expressing Wild-Type and Mutant CES1\n\nA total of 20 *CES1* variants were selected for an in vitro functional study based on the criteria that the SNPs or haplotypes have a MAF >0.5% in a population or the variants are located within a 5-Å distance from the CES1 active site ([Table 1](#T1)). Mutant *CES1* plasmids were generated by a site-directed mutagenesis assay with specific mutagenic primers ([Supplemental Table 1](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1124/dmd.117.077669/-/DC1)) and transfected to human embryonic kidney cells (Flp-In-293) based on previously published methods ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31)). The desired sequences of wild-type (WT) and mutant *CES1* plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. Verified *CES1* plasmids were co-transfected with a pOG44 plasmid at a ratio of 1:10 into Flp-In-293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000. Six hours after transfection, cells were gently rinsed to remove transfection reagents and were then cultured in complete medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS). After 12 hours, the culture medium was replaced with a complete medium supplemented with the antibiotic hygromycin B (100 *μ*g/ml) for the selection of CES1 transfected cells. Stable WT and mutant CES1-expressing cell lines were established after culture with hygromycin B for at least 3 weeks. All transfected cell lines were validated by DNA sequencing analysis.\n\n### TABLE 1.\n\n| nsSNP or Haplotype | Protein Residue Changes | Nucleotide Changes | MAF |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| African | European (FINN) | European (Non-FINN) | East Asian | South Asian | Latino | Other |  |  |  |\n|   |   |   | % |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| nsSNP |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| rs151291296 | L40Ter | T227G | 0.51 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| rs2307240 | S75N | G332A | 4.30 | 3.83 | 5.37 | 4.68 | 7.44 | 2.06 | 5.29 |\n| rs121912777 | G142E | G533A | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| rs146456965 | G147C | G547T | 0.03 | 0.00 | 0.08 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| rs202121317 | A158V | C581T | 0.04 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.03 | 6.69 | 0.04 | 0.11 |\n| rs147694791 | T167S | C608G | 5.48 | 0.00 | 0.01 | 0.00 | 0.01 | 0.32 | 0.00 |\n| rs143718310 | Q169P | A614C | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| rs148947808 | Y170D | T616G | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| rs201065375 | R171C | C619T | 0.01 | 0.00 | 0.02 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.05 | 0.00 |\n| rs4784575 | G173D | G626A | 0.01 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.39 | 0.02 | 0.12 | 0.00 |\n| rs60054861 | R186P | G665C | 12.39 | 0.02 | 0.24 | 0.01 | 0.02 | 0.69 | 1.23 |\n| rs2307243 | R199H | G704A | 0.74 | 0.00 | 0.03 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.03 | 0.00 |\n| rs2307227 | D203E | C717A | 8.30 | 0.71 | 3.16 | 1.18 | 4.33 | 1.70 | 3.53 |\n| rs200707504 | E220G | A767G | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.55 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| rs115629050 | A269S | G913T | 8.25 | 0.71 | 3.15 | 1.24 | 4.31 | 1.71 | 3.52 |\n| rs114119971 | H284Q | C960G | 0.18 | 0.27 | 0.71 | 0.00 | 0.06 | 0.26 | 0.44 |\n| rs202001817 | T290M | C977T | 1.21 | 0.03 | 0.19 | 0.02 | 2.86 | 1.87 | 0.11 |\n| rs576295379 | N340K | T1128G | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.01 | 0.00 | 0.55 | 0.01 | 0.11 |\n| Haplotype |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| D203E-A269S |   |   | 5.22 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | NA |\n| S75N-D203E-A269S |   |   | 3.56 | 1.01 | 4.46 | 1.49 | 4.29 | 2.02 | NA |\n\nTable 1 Caption: MAFs of CES1 nsSNPs and haplotypes\n\n### Preparation of S9 Fractions from Transfected Cells and Individual Human Livers\n\nFor the preparation of S9 fractions from the transfected cell lines, cells were cultured in 175-cm^2^ flasks until they reached approximately 95% confluence. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before they were harvested in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. The cells were then lysed by sonication, followed by centrifugation at 9000*g* at 4°C for 30 minutes. The supernatant (S9 fraction) was collected in 1.5-ml protein low binding tubes and stored at −80°C until use. Individual human liver S9 fractions were prepared according to a previous publication ([Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)).\n\n### Enzymatic Activity Assays\n\nIn vitro incubation studies were conducted to determine CES1 activities of the prepared S9 fraction samples on hydrolysis of the CES1 substrates enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril. Enalapril incubation was carried out in 4-ml silanized glass vials because of significant nonspecific bindings of enalapril and its hydrolytic metabolite enalaprilat to plastic Eppendorf tubes ([Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)). For clopidogrel and sacubitril, incubations were performed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Enalapril (500 *μ*M), clopidogrel (100 *μ*M), and sacubitril (200 *μ*M) were incubated with S9 fractions at final protein concentrations of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 mg/ml, respectively, at 37°C for 10 minutes. The hydrolysis reactions were terminated by the addition of a 4-fold volume of methanol containing the internal standard (IS) 5-hydroxy omeprazole (20 ng/ml) for enalapril, a 2-fold volume of acetonitrile with the IS *d*_4_-clopidogrel carboxylic acid (25 ng/ml) for clopidogrel, and a 3-fold volume of acetonitrile with the IS ritalinic acid (7.2 *μ*g/ml) for sacubitril. After centrifugation at 17,000*g* at 4°C for 20 minutes, the supernatant was collected and analyzed for metabolite concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-MS/MS methods described previously ([Zhu et al., 2013](#B32); [Shi et al., 2016b](#B18); [Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)). In addition, S9 fractions from vector-transfected cells served as a blank control in the CES1 activity studies.\n\n### Quantification of CES1 Protein in Human Livers and WT and Mutant CES1 Transfected Cells\n\nAbsolute CES1 protein expression levels in individual human liver samples were quantified using a SILAC-based LC-MS/MS assay that we previously established ([Wang et al., 2016a](#B24)).\n\nRelative CES1 protein quantifications in S9 fractions from transfected cells were conducted using a similar SILAC-based LC-MS/MS assay without having CES1 calibration curves. The intensities of several selected CES1 unique peptides were normalized by the SILAC counterpart peptides (i.e., IS), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the internal reference protein for quality control. Relative CES1 protein expression in each mutant cell line was calculated by comparison with the CES1 expression level in WT *CES1* transfected cells.\n\n### Analysis of CES1 mRNA Expression in WT and Mutant CES1 Transfected Cells\n\nWT and mutant *CES1* transfected cells were cultured in six-well plates. One microgram of RNA extracted from the cells was reverse transcribed to cDNA using oligo dT primers. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs) were performed on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green fluorescence. GAPDH was detected as the internal control for normalization. *CES1* gene expression in mutant cell lines relative to that in WT CES1 cells were determined by the 2^−ΔΔCT^ method. In addition, RNA isolated from vector-transfected cells was included in the qRT-PCR study as a blank control. The primers and experimental conditions for the qRT-PCR experiments are described in [Supplemental Tables 1 and 2](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1124/dmd.117.077669/-/DC1), respectively.\n\n### cDNA Sequencing of Human Liver Samples\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from 50 mg frozen individual human liver tissues using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 *μ*g total RNA using the reverse transcription protocol described above. Nested PCR was subsequently applied to amplification of the whole length of the CES1 cDNA. Final PCR products were purified and subjected to bidirectional sequencing with four pairs of primers. The primers and nested PCR conditions for the CES1 cDNA amplification are listed in [Supplemental Tables 1 and 2](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1124/dmd.117.077669/-/DC1), respectively.\n\n### HPLC-MS/MS Analysis\n\nThe HPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) coupled with an Applied Biosystems API 4000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer.\n\n#### LC-MS/MS Method for CES1 Activity Assay.\n\nThe hydrolytic metabolites enalaprilat, clopidogrel carboxylate, and LBQ657 were quantitated using previously described assays with some modifications ([Zhu et al., 2013](#B32); [Shi et al., 2016b](#B18); [Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)). The analytes were isolated on a Shimadzu VP-ODS column (5 *μ*m, 150 × 2.0 mm; Shimadzu) with the mobile phase delivered at a constant flow rate (0.3 ml/min for enalaprilat, 0.25 ml/min for clopidogrel carboxylate, and 0.2 ml/min for LBQ657). The gradient conditions are summarized in [Supplemental Table 3](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1124/dmd.117.077669/-/DC1). The column temperature was set at 50°C for enalaprilat and 40°C for clopidogrel carboxylate and LBQ657. An injection volume of 10 *μ*l was used for all analytes. Positive electrospray ionization mode was applied, and ions were monitored by multiple reaction monitoring with the following mass-to-charge transitions: enalaprilat (349.0 > 206.0), clopidogrel carboxylate (308.0 > 197.9), LBQ657 (384.7 > 266.7), 5-hydroxy omeprazole (362.34 > 213.9), clopidogrel *d*_4_-carboxylic acid (312.1 > 202.0), and ritalinic acid (220.5 > 84.6).\n\n#### LC-MS/MS Method for CES1 Protein Quantification.\n\nTo quantitate the relative CES1 protein expression levels in the transfected cells, an established targeted CES1 proteomics assay was adopted with some modifications ([Wang et al., 2016a](#B24)). In brief, six CES1 unique peptides (i.e., AISESGVALTSVLVK, FLSLDLQGDPR, TAMSLLWK, SYPLVC[CAM]IAK, ELIPEATEK, FWANFAR) and one GAPDH unique peptide (GALQNIIPASTGAAK) and the corresponding heavy isotope-labeled SILAC peptides were separated on a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (5 *μ*M, 150 × 2.1 mm; Agilent Technologies). The column temperature was set at 40°C. The mobile phase was delivered at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with the gradient conditions listed in [Supplemental Table 3](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1124/dmd.117.077669/-/DC1). Under positive ionization mode, analytes were monitored at the transitions described previously ([Wang et al., 2016a](#B24)). The data were analyzed using Skyline software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA).\n\n### Data Analysis\n\nData are representative of three independent experiments and values are expressed as means ± S.D. The unpaired, two-tailed *t* test was used to determine the differences in CES1 expression and activity between *CES1* variants and WT controls (GraphPad Prism software, version 6.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). *P* < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Results\n\n### Enzymatic Activity of WT and Mutant CES1 on Enalapril, Clopidogrel, and Sacubitril Hydrolysis\n\nA total of 21 stable CES1 expressing cell lines were established to evaluate the effect of the candidate *CES1* nsSNPs and haplotypes on CES1 activity utilizing the CES1 substrates enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril ([Fig. 1](#F1)). All three CES1 substrates were efficiently hydrolyzed by WT CES1. No appreciable hydrolytic metabolites were formed after incubation of the three substrates with the S9 fractions from cells expressing the *CES1* nsSNPs L40Ter, G142E, G147C, Y170D, and R171C, indicating that these five nsSNPs were loss-of-function variants for CES1. Among the five loss-of-function CES1 mutations, except for L40Ter, all variants were located close to the CES1 active site. Q169P (rs143718310), another nsSNP located near the CES1 active site, exhibited approximately 50% of CES1 activity on hydrolysis of the three substrates relative to the WT enzyme. Moreover, the CES1 SNP E220G, which has an MAF of 0.55% in South Asians and 3.1% in Koreans but is rare in other populations, significantly decreased CES1 hydrolytic activity on enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril by 78.8% ± 2.6%, 82.3% ± 3.5%, and 80.3% ± 3.0%, respectively. The variants A158V (MAF = 6.69% in South Asians) and R199H (MAF = 0.74% in Africans) showed significantly decreased activity on enalapril hydrolysis (53.4% ± 1.5% and 59.5% ± 2.0%, respectively, of the WT CES1). Interestingly, these two nsSNPs did not significantly affect the hydrolysis of clopidogrel and sacubitril. This substrate-specific effect was also observed for T290M (MAF = 1.24% in Africans, 2.86% in South Asians, and 1.87% in Latinos), which reduced the hydrolysis of clopidogrel by 50.7% ± 16.8% while having no significant effect on enalapril and sacubitril metabolism. In addition to the individual nsSNPs, the two common haplotypes D203E-A269S and S75N-D203E-A269S were also studied for their potential effect on CES1 catalytic activity. The in vitro incubation study indicated that none of the haplotypes significantly affect CES1 activity on hydrolyzing enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril.\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ace4/5637814/656fd358d4b4/dmd.117.077669f1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=5637814_dmd.117.077669f1.jpg)\n\n(A–C) Effect of CES1 nsSNPs and haplotypes on hydrolysis of enalapril (A), clopidogrel (B), and sacubitril (C) in CES1 transfected cell lines. Enalapril (500 μM), clopidogrel (100 μM), and sacubitril (200 μM) were incubated with S9 fractions prepared from cells stably transfected with WT CES1 and candidate variants (18 nsSNPs and two haplotypes: D203E-A269S and S75N-D203E-A269S). Hydrolysis rates of enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril were determined by measuring the formation of the respective hydrolytic metabolites enalaprilat, clopidogrel carboxylic acid, and LBQ465. Vector-transfected cells were used as a blank control. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. (n = 3). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.001 (CES1 variants versus WT CES1).\n\n### CES1 Protein and mRNA Expression Levels in WT and Mutant CES1 Cell Lines\n\nCES1 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the WT *CES1* transfected cells, with levels comparable to that in the human liver (data not shown). No detectable CES1 mRNA and protein was found in the vector control cells. nsSNP G147C decreased CES1 mRNA and protein expression levels by 80.5% ± 0.7% and 86.7% ± 2.8%, respectively. L40Ter-expressing cells displayed normal CES1 mRNA expression levels but null CES1 protein expression, which is likely due to the premature stop codon in exon 2 introduced by this variant. Interestingly, the CES1 protein levels of the Y170D and R171C variants were only 7.4% ± 2.8% and 5.9 ± 3.6% of WT CES1, respectively, whereas mRNA expression levels were not significantly affected. Neither haplotype S75N-D203E-A269S nor D203E-A269S affected the CES1 protein or mRNA expression levels in the transfected cells.\n\n### CES1 nsSNPs S75N, D203E, and A269S Had No Effect on CES1 Protein Expression and Activity in the Human Liver\n\nCES1 mRNA extracted from a total of 104 individual human liver samples was reverse transcribed to cDNA and subsequently sequenced for *CES1* nsSNPs. Twelve subjects were S75N heterozygotes and 10 subjects were heterozygous for D203E and A269S. We noted that D203E and A269S were in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other in our samples; 9 of the 10 D203E and A269S carriers were also heterozygous for the S75N variant (i.e., S75N-D203E-A269S haplotype). No other candidate *CES1* nsSNPs were found in the liver samples, which is likely because 94 of the 104 subjects were Caucasians and the other candidate *CES1* nsSNPs are rare in Caucasians. In addition, the known loss-of-function *CES1* nsSNP G143E and several rare nsSNPs that are not on our candidate nsSNP list were identified in the human liver samples, including I49V (rs3826193), L97I (rs571416840), A93V (rs202111709), and A156T (rs187158640). [Table 2](#T2) provides a summary of the genotypes, CES1 protein expression, CES1 activity on enalapril metabolism, and the CES1 activity normalized by protein expression of all CES1 nsSNPs carriers from the 104 human liver samples. Consistent with the results from the transfected cells, neither CES1 protein expression nor activity was affected by S75N and the haplotype S75N-D203E-A269S ([Fig. 3](#F3)). The effect of G143E on enalapril metabolism in the human liver was described in a recently published study ([Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)). Statistical analysis was not performed for other variants due to the small sample size of the carriers.\n\n### TABLE 2.\n\n| Subject Number | S75N | D203E | A269S | G143E | I49V | L97I | A93V | A156T | Enalapril Hydrolysis Rate | CES1 Protein Expression | Normalized CES1 Activity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | pmol/min per mg protein | pmol/mg protein | pmol/min per pmol CES1 |\n| L2 | S/N | D/D | A/A | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 40.3 | 104.17 | 0.39 |\n| L16 | S/N | D/D | A/A | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 45.3 | 84.45 | 0.54 |\n| L40 | S/N | D/D | A/A | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 93.4 | 170.44 | 0.55 |\n| L8 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 62.4 | 184.06 | 0.34 |\n| L31 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 12.6 | 104.39 | 0.12 |\n| L45 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 41.1 | 118.41 | 0.35 |\n| L60 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 64.4 | 194.12 | 0.33 |\n| L61 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 50.3 | 141.49 | 0.36 |\n| L72 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 153.7 | 266.06 | 0.58 |\n| L90 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 36.3 | 102.01 | 0.36 |\n| L95 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 87.8 | 215.71 | 0.41 |\n| L102 | S/N | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 83.7 | 104.85 | 0.80 |\n| L99 | S/S | D/E | A/S | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 20.2 | 69.99 | 0.29 |\n| L41 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/E | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 15.9 | 236.16 | 0.07 |\n| L73 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/E | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/T | 22.4 | 96.33 | 0.23 |\n| L94 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/E | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 28.4 | 156.11 | 0.18 |\n| L103 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/E | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 19.9 | 163.28 | 0.12 |\n| L104 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/E | I/I | L/L | A/A | A/A | 17.6 | 273.32 | 0.06 |\n| L3 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/G | I/V | L/L | A/A | A/A | 0.0 | 155.26 | 0.00 |\n| L5 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/G | I/V | L/I | A/A | A/A | 26.4 | 102.37 | 0.26 |\n| L89 | S/S | D/D | A/A | G/G | I/I | L/L | A/V | A/A | 183.6 | 435.68 | 0.42 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: CES1 genotypes, CES1 protein expression, CES1 activity on enalapril metabolism, and the activity normalized by CES1 protein expression in human livers carrying CES1 nsSNPs\n\n### Fig. 3.\n\n![Fig. 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ace4/5637814/f5105acca044/dmd.117.077669f3.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=5637814_dmd.117.077669f3.jpg)\n\n(A and B) Hepatic CES1 activity on enalapril activation (A) and absolute CES1 expression (B) among different CES1 genotypes (i.e., S75N, n = 3; D203E-A269S, n = 1; S75N-D203E-A269S, n = 9; and WT, n = 33). The WT control contains 33 subjects who do not carry any nsSNPs. Statistical analysis was not performed for the D203E-A269S haplotype due to the very limited carrier number.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCES1, the most abundant hepatic enzyme in humans ([Achour et al., 2017](#B1)), catalyzes the hydrolysis of many clinically important drugs ([Shi et al., 2006](#B16), [2016a](#B17),[b](#B18),[c](#B19); [Zhu et al., 2008](#B31), [2013](#B32); [Wang et al., 2016b](#B25); [Stage et al., 2017](#B20)). Considerable interindividual variability in CES1 expression and activity has been consistently demonstrated by our laboratory and others ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31), [2013](#B32); [Laizure et al., 2013](#B6); [Rasmussen et al., 2015](#B13); [Shi et al., 2016a](#B17); [Wang et al., 2016b](#B25); [Oh et al., 2017](#B12); [Stage et al., 2017](#B20)). Varied CES1 function may lead to variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs metabolized by CES1. *CES1* genetic variation has been established as a significant contributor to CES1 variability ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31), [2013](#B32); [Rasmussen et al., 2015](#B13); [Shi et al., 2016a](#B17),[b](#B18),[c](#B19); [Wang et al., 2016b](#B25); [Stage et al., 2017](#B20)). Among thousands of variants identified within the *CES1* gene, nsSNPs are of particular interest because, relative to other types of genetic variants, nsSNPs are more likely to be functionally significant due to associated changes in amino acid sequences. The discovery of the loss-of-function variant G143E has exemplified the functional significance and clinical implications of *CES1* nsSNPs ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31)). However, only a very few *CES1* nsSNPs have been studied so far ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31); [Shi et al., 2016c](#B19); [Stage et al., 2017](#B20)), leaving a large portion of CES1 variability unexplained. Several in silico programs such as SIFT and Polyphen2 were developed to predict functional consequences of nsSNPs. However, our previous study demonstrated that the in silico analysis was not predictive of the effect of *CES1* nsSNPs on enzyme function ([Zhu et al., 2013](#B32)). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive in vitro functional study to determine the impact of *CES1* nsSNPs on CES1 expression and activity using *CES1* transfected cell lines and individual human liver tissues.\n\nThe MAFs of *CES1* nsSNPs vary markedly among different ethnic groups ([Table 1](#T1)); however, the majority of previous *CES1* pharmacogenomics studies have focused on common variants in Caucasians. This study included *CES1* nsSNPs with an MAF >0.5% in a given population to make the assessment applicable to all ethnic groups. Five *CES1* nsSNPs (i.e., L40Ter, E220G, A158V, R199H, and T290M) were functionally significant. L40Ter (MAF = 0.55% in Africans) was a loss-of-function variant for the hydrolysis of enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril ([Fig. 1](#F1)). This variant resulted in a premature stop codon in exon2, abolishing the production of mature CES1 protein, although the *CES1* mRNA level in the L40Ter transfected cells was comparable to the WT control ([Fig. 2](#F2)). E220G showed a significant decreasing effect on the hydrolysis of all three tested CES1 substrates. Consistent with our in vitro data, E220G was predicted in silico to be deleterious to CES1 activity, as it resides near the active site ([Nzabonimpa et al., 2016](#B11)). Given that CES1 protein and mRNA levels were unaltered in E220G-expressing cells ([Fig. 2](#F2)), the effect of E220G on CES1 activity was likely due to the disruption of CES1-substrate bindings. The MAF of this variant was 0.55% in East Asians according to the dbSNP database; however, a recent study reported that this variant is very common in Koreans (MAF = 3.1%) ([Oh et al., 2017](#B12)). This study also revealed that E220G was associated with a greater systemic exposure to oseltamivir in healthy subjects who received a single dose of oseltamivir (75 mg). This clinical observation is in agreement with our in vitro study, indicating that E220G reduces CES1 activity.\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n![Fig. 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ace4/5637814/f2879a13d09a/dmd.117.077669f2.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=5637814_dmd.117.077669f2.jpg)\n\n(A and B) CES1 protein (A) and mRNA (B) expression levels in the CES1 nsSNP and haplotype transfected cells. Relative CES1 protein and mRNA levels of the CES1 variants compared with WT CES1 were determined using LC-MS/MS and qRT-PCR assays, respectively. WT CES1 and vector-transfected cells were included as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Data are presented as means ± S.D. (n = 3). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.001 (CES1 variants versus WT CES1).\n\nIt is interesting that the effects of the *CES1* nsSNPs A158V, R199H, and T290M on CES1 activity are substrate dependent ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Enalapril hydrolysis was reduced to 46.6% ± 1.5% and 40.5% ± 2.0% of the WT enzyme by A158V and R199H, respectively, whereas the hydrolysis of clopidogrel and sacubitril was not affected by the variants. In addition, T290M decreased clopidogrel hydrolysis by 50.7% ± 16.8%, while having no effect on enalapril and sacubitril metabolism ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Given the high frequencies of A158V in South Asians (MAF = 6.69%) and R199H in Africans (MAF = 0.74%), A158V and R199H could be clinically significant for optimizing enalapril therapy in South Asians and Africans, respectively. T290M is relatively prevalent in Africans, South Asians, and Latinos, with an MAF of 1.24%, 2.86%, and 1.87%, respectively. It should be noted that >85% of ingested clopidogrel is metabolized by CES1, and the *CES1* nsSNP G143E has shown significant effects on clopidogrel activation as well as its therapeutic outcomes ([Lewis et al., 2013](#B8); [Zhu et al., 2013](#B32); [Tarkiainen et al., 2015a](#B22)). Therefore, T290M could be a significant contributor to the interindividual variation in clopidogrel therapy in relevant populations. It should be noted that the differential effect of *CES1* genetic polymorphisms on different CES1 substrates has been observed in previous studies. For example, G143E was a loss-of-function variant for the metabolism of methylphenidate, clopidogrel, enalapril, and dabigatran but a decreased function variant for oseltamivir metabolism ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31); [Zhu and Markowitz, 2009](#B30); [Shi et al., 2016b](#B18); [Wang et al., 2016b](#B25)). Similar to the G143E nsSNP, A158V, R199H, and T290M diminished CES1 activity without altering the mRNA or protein expression levels ([Figs. 1](#F1)–[3](#F3)), indicating that these variants might directly affect the enzyme-substrate interaction. Given that chemical structures differ significantly among enalapril, clopidogrel, and sacubitril, we speculate that the involvement of amino acid residues in catalyzing the cleavage of the ester bonds of these compounds may vary, which may have resulted in the observed substrate-dependent effect of the three nsSNPs.\n\nA recent healthy volunteer study reported that the area under the curve of d-methylphenidate plasma concentrations was increased by 68% in A269S carriers compared with noncarriers after subjects were administered a single dose of 10 mg methylphenidate ([Lyauk et al., 2016](#B9)). However, our in vitro studies of transfected cells and human livers showed that A269S was not associated with CES1 expression or activity. Given the fact that A269S is in complete LD (D’ = 1, *R*^2^ = 1) with D203E and is in high LD with S75N (D’ = 0.664, *R*^2^ = 0.399), we established cell lines that stably expressed the haplotypes D203E-A269S and S75N-D203E-A269S and we evaluated the impact of the haplotypes on CES1 expression and the metabolism of the CES1 substrates clopidogrel, enalapril, and sacubitril. We also genotyped a large set of human liver tissues for the *CES1* nsSNPs and haplotypes and determined the CES1 expression and activity on enalapril hydrolysis. As shown in [Figs. 1](#F1)–[3](#F3), neither D203E-A269S nor S75N-D203E-A269S exhibited a significant effect on CES1 protein expression or activity in the transfected cells and human liver tissues.\n\nEight *CES1* nsSNPs, including G142E, G143E, G147E, Q169P, Y170D, R171C, G173D, and E220G, are located within a 5-Å distance from the CES1 active site, according to analysis of the CES1 three-dimensional structure ([Nzabonimpa et al., 2016](#B11)). One of the variants, G143E, showed a profound impact on CES1 activity and consequently impaired the metabolism of several CES1 substrate drugs ([Zhu et al., 2008](#B31), [2009b](#B29); [Nemoda et al., 2009](#B10); [Zhu and Markowitz, 2009](#B30); [Lewis et al., 2013](#B8); [Tarkiainen et al., 2015a](#B22),[b](#B23); [Shi et al., 2016b](#B18); [Wang et al., 2016a](#B24)). In this study, stable cell lines transfected with CES1 variants were developed to assess the functions of the rest of the seven *CES1* nsSNPs located in close proximity to the CES1 active site. As expected, all seven nsSNPs affected CES1 activity to a certain extent, although effect magnitude and substrate specificity varied among the nsSNPs ([Fig. 1](#F1)).\n\nCES1 protein and mRNA expression levels are highly correlated among the transfected cell lines with the exception of the L40T, Y170D, and R171C variants ([Supplemental Fig. 1](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1124/dmd.117.077669/-/DC1)). The three variants markedly impaired CES1 protein expression without affecting mRNA levels ([Fig. 2](#F2)). As expected, the correlation between CES1 activity and protein expression was significantly higher than that between the activity and mRNA expression for the tested variants ([Supplemental Fig. 2](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1124/dmd.117.077669/-/DC1)). Furthermore, a number of nsSNPs, such as G142E and E220G, significantly attenuated CES1 activity while imposing no effect on CES1 protein and mRNA expression levels.\n\nIn summary, to our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive functional assessment of *CES1* nonsynonymous variants and haplotypes and reveals a number of nsSNPs that exhibit significant effects on the metabolism of CES1 substrates. Clinical investigations are warranted to determine the influence of the identified functional nsSNPs on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications metabolized by CES1. It is noted that the functional nsSNPs identified from this study may only explain a small portion of CES1 variability based on the frequencies of the variants. Thus, further investigations are needed to elucidate genetic and nongenetic elements regulating this important drug-metabolizing enzyme.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\n## Authorship Contributions\n\n*Participated in research design:* Wang, Shi, Wu, Bleske, Zhu.\n\n*Conducted experiments:* Wang, Rida, Shi.\n\n*Performed data analysis:* Wang, Shi, Zhu.\n\n*Wrote or contributed to the writing of the manuscript:* Wang, Rida, Shi, Wu, Bleske, Zhu.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

In 2007, and again in January 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved label changes for warfarin to recommend lower initial doses for patients known to have single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genes: one affecting warfarin metabolism (*CYP*2*C9*), and the other affecting sensitivity (*VKORC1*) ([1](#R1)-[3](#R3)). Several pharmacogenetic algorithms incorporate SNPs in both genes (e.g. *CYP2C9**2, *3 and *VKORC1* -1639 G>A), but these SNPs alone explain only one-third of the variability in warfarin dose ([4](#R4)-[8](#R8)). The inclusion of non-genetic factors can explain an additional one-fifth of warfarin dosing variability ([8](#R8), [9](#R9)). Incorporating other SNPs may further improve the accuracy of warfarin dosing ([10](#R10)-[13](#R13)).\n\nBecause of the critical pharmacodynamic role gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (*GGCX*) plays in the generation of vitamin K-dependent proteins, SNPs in the *GGCX* gene may affect the dose of warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists. *GGCX* resides in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, oxidizing reduced vitamin K to vitamin K-2,3-epoxide while adding a carboxyl residue to the gamma carbon on selected glutamic acids to produce functional clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and other vitamin K dependent proteins ([6](#R6), [14](#R14)-[16](#R16)). Patients with defects in *GGCX* have elevated International Normalized Ratios (INRs), even in the absence of a vitamin K antagonist ([17](#R17)), and *GGCX*-knockout mice die at birth from massive hemorrhage ([18](#R18)).\n\nAlthough previous investigators have examined *GGCX* polymorphisms in patients taking warfarin, initial reports of associations with warfarin dose have either been unsubstantiated or await validation. A SNP located in intron 2, rs12714145 G>A, was associated with a 3.3% increase in warfarin dose requirements per A allele in a Swedish study of 201 patients ([6](#R6)). This observation was not confirmed in two subsequent studies which genotyped only 186 European Americans and 318 Chinese patients, respectively ([19](#R19), [20](#R20)). However, if validated, the association would be important because this SNP explained 1.4-3.3% of the dose variability in the Swedish population ([6](#R6)).\n\nMore recently, *GGCX* rs11676382 C>G, located in intron 14, correlated with lower warfarin doses in a single-center study of 186 European Americans, explaining 2% of the total variance of the warfarin maintenance dose in a dominant genetic model ([19](#R19)). However, the putative association was not significant in an additive model or after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, Lubitz et al. did not confirm the significance of this SNP in 145 multiethnic patients ([21](#R21)). The goal of the present study, therefore, was to further investigate the putative associations between warfarin therapeutic dose and *GGCX* rs12714145 and rs11676382 in a large, multiracial, multi-centered cohort.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Study Design\n\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 985 patients who have been well characterized ([8](#R8), [11](#R11), [22](#R22), [23](#R23)). Patients provided written, informed consent for use of their DNA, and the participating institutions approved the protocol. We genotyped adult patients ([Table 1](#T1)) who had their warfarin therapy managed at one of three sites: the anticoagulation clinics affiliated with Barnes–Jewish Hospital at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis, the Anticoagulation Clinics of North America (San Antonio), and subjects who participated in the PREVENT (PREvention of VENous Thromboembolism) study ([23](#R23)). A stable therapeutic warfarin dose was defined as a dose that was unchanged for at least six days and resulted in two or more consecutive therapeutic INR values at least 3 days apart.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Variables |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Demographic variables | N = 985 |\n| Age, mean (SD), y | 60 (15) |\n| Gender: |   |\n| Women, N (%) | 486 (49.3%) |\n| Men, N (%) | 499 (50.7%) |\n| Race: |   |\n| Caucasian, N (%) | 772 (78.4%) |\n| African-American, N (%) | 180(18.3%) |\n| Asian or East Indian, N (%) | 3(0.3%) |\n| Other or Unknown, N (%) | 30 (3.0%) |\n| Clinical variables |   |\n| Therapeutic warfarin dose, geometric mean (SD), mg/d | 4.8 (1.6) |\n| Target INR, mean (SD), units | 2.3 (0.4) |\n| Body surface area, mean (SD), m2 | 2.0 (0.3) |\n| Current smoker, N (%) | 140 (14%) |\n| Takes amiodarone, N (%) | 33 (3%) |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Patient Demographics for GGCX analysis.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nDNA was extracted from patients’ whole blood or buffy coat samples using Puregene Purification Kits (Gentra, now Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping was performed for *GGCX* rs11676382 and rs12714145 using PCR and Pyrosequencing® ([24](#R24), [25](#R25)). PCR primers were designed using the UCSC Golden Path Human Genome Browser March 2006 Build ([http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway)) and *GGCX* Refseq [NM_000821](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_000821) ([Appendix 1](#SD1)).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nTo test an additive effect of *GGCX* SNPs on warfarin dose requirements, we coded each *GGCX* SNP as 0, 1, or 2 for the number of variant alleles present. We then regressed the number of *GGCX* SNPs onto the residual of the prediction according to a validated pharmacogenetic algorithm ([8](#R8), [21](#R21)): residual=In(observed therapeutic dose)-In(predicted dose)= βo+β1*(number of alleles), where *ln* is the natural logarithm. By exponentiating the residual error, we obtain the ratio of the observed dose/predicted dose, which can be used to correct the validated algorithm for *GGCX*, when genotype is known ([Appendix 2](#SD1)).\n\nTo reduce the effect of extreme therapeutic dose values on regression coefficients, we Winsorized the 6 doses that fell outside of the usual (1-18 mg/day) range. We tested the model fit using standard regression diagnostic methods. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\n## RESULTS\n\nParticipants had an average age of 60 years and half were female ([Table 1](#T1)). One hundred seventeen (12%) inherited one or two copies of the *GGCX* rs11676382 G allele ([Table 2](#T2)). The geometric means (SD) of the therapeutic dose (mg/day), stratified by rs11676382, were: C/C 4.9 (1.6); G/C 4.1 (1.6); and G/G 3.8 (2.2). *GGCX* rs11676382 was a significant predictor of residual dosing error (p=0.03), and was associated with a 6.1% (95% CI: 0.6%-11.4%) reduction in warfarin dose, per G allele ([Table 3](#T3)). Adding rs1167382 to the validated pharmacogenetic algorithm ([8](#R8)) increased the R^2^ by 0.2% in the total population and by 0.3% in Caucasians.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| GGCX Alleles | Caucasians | African-Americans | Asian or East Indians | Other or Unknown Race | Association (95% CI) with dose residual, per allele |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| rs11676382 |   |   |   |   |   |\n| C/C | 662 (85.8%) | 175 (97.2%) | 3 | 28 (93.3%) |   |\n| G/C | 103 (13.3%) | 5 (2.8%) | 0 | 2 (6.7%) | 6.1% (0.6%-11.4%) |\n| G/G | 7 (0.9%) | 0 (0.0%) | 0 | 0 (0%) |   |\n| rs12714145 |   |   |   |   |   |\n| G/G | 394 (51.0%) | 56 (31.1%) | 3 | 14(46.7%) |   |\n| G/A | 298 (38.6%) | 91 (50.6%) | 0 | 14 (46.7%) | NS |\n| A/A | 80 (10.4%) | 33 (18.3%) | 0 | 2 (6.7%) |   |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Genotype Frequencies.\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| GGCX rs11676382 genotype | Formula for Correction Factor* | Adjustment in African-Americans and Asians* | Adjustment in Caucasians* |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CC | 1 / (PC2 + 2PCPG × 0.939 + PG2 × 0.9392) | 1.00 | 1.01 |\n| GC | 0.939 / (PC2 + 2PCPG × 0.939 + PG2 × 0.9392) | 0.94 | 0.95 |\n| GG | 0.9392 / (PC2 + 2PCPG × 0.939 + PG2 × 0.9392) | 0.88 | 0.89 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Adjustment Factors for Existing Pharmacogenetic Dosing Algorithms, Depending on GGCX Genotype.\n\nHalf of the subjects (N = 492) carried either one or both copies of the *GGCX* rs12714145 A allele ([Table 2](#T2)), but it was not a significant predictor of dose residual (p=0.39). The geometric mean (SD) therapeutic dose was 4.7 (1.6) for subjects with either the *GGCX* rs12714145 A/A or A/G genotype, and was 5.1 (1.6) for those with G/G genotype.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nAlthough *GGCX* rs12714145 was not confirmed as a predictor of therapeutic warfarin dose requirements, *GGCX* rs11676382 C>G was significantly associated with decreased warfarin requirements: each G allele was associated with a 6.1% reduction (e.g. 93.9% of prediction) in dose. The effect of *GGCX* rs11676382 C>G on R^2^ was modest, however, and could explain why Lubitz et. al were unable to confirm this association in their smaller population of 145 diverse patients ([21](#R21)). Given the allele frequency of rs11676382 C>G, we estimate about 14% of Caucasians would carry this SNP, and without genotyping for it, their initial pharmacogenetic-based therapeutic warfarin dose estimates would be 6%–12% too high. Because of warfarin's narrow therapeutic index, even this modest over-estimation of warfarin dose could contribute to supratherapeutic INR values or bleeding.\n\nWith *CYP2C9* (*2 and *3) and *VKORC1* −1639 G>A SNPs explaining about one-third of the variability in therapeutic warfarin dose ([4](#R4)-[6](#R6), [8](#R8), [26](#R26)), and emerging data from recent high throughput genotyping studies of Swedish and Chinese populations ([27](#R27)-[29](#R29)), few other genes are likely to have major effects on warfarin dose. However, by genotyping for *GGCX* rs11676382 and other SNPs that raise R^2^ modestly ([10](#R10)-[13](#R13)), one could increase the accuracy of existing pharmacogenetic algorithms significantly.\n\nIn their sample of 201 predominantly Swedish patients, Wadelius et al. 2005, found a 3.3% increase in dose per *GGCX* rs12714145 A allele ([6](#R6), [30](#R30)). While their univariate analysis was significant for this SNP (p=0.036), their multivariate analysis was not ([6](#R6), [30](#R30)). Reider et al., on the other hand, did not find any association with warfarin dose and rs10691423, a SNP that is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs12714145 ([19](#R19)). Similarly, our analysis of *GGCX* rs12714145 A SNP in a larger (n= 985), more diverse population found no association between this SNP and warfarin dose.\n\nThe scope of the present study was limited to validating two *GGCX* SNPs in a large and diverse cohort of therapeutic patients. We did not evaluate *GGCX* rs699664 (8016G>A; Q325R), which was associated with increased warfarin dosage in Japanese patients ([31](#R31)), even though prior studies in Caucasian populations did not confirm this putative association ([19](#R19), [32](#R32), [33](#R33)). A related limitation is that few Asian patients were included in the present study. However rs11676382 C>G has yet to be observed in Asian populations according to public databases such as HapMap Phase 3. Lastly, as with any warfarin related study, definitions of stable warfarin dose and selection of covariates vary among studies ([34](#R34)-[38](#R38)), and obfuscate attempts at repeatability.\n\nIn August, 2009 the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced it would reimburse for warfarin pharmacogenetic testing only in the setting of approved randomized clinical trials. We hope that CMS will remunerate laboratories involved in warfarin pharmacogenetic research not only for *VKORC1* and *CYP2C9* testing, but also for *GGCX* and other SNPs ([10](#R10)-[13](#R13)) that modestly improve accuracy. Although delaying warfarin therapy while waiting for a $400 genotype of 2 genes may not be cost effective now,([39](#R39)) in the future, genotyping of multiple SNPs will become faster and less expensive, so the cost effectiveness of pharmacogenetic dosing will improve. Using all available pharmacogenetic information during warfarin initiation would allow for optimal dosing accuracy. With this vision in mind, we have updated our non-profit website, [www.WarfarinDosing.org](http://www.WarfarinDosing.org), to accommodate, but not require, *GGCX* rs11676382.

What does this paper add? |\n| • GGCX rs11676382 was associated with a 6.1% reduction in warfarin dose (95% CI: 0.6%-11.4%) per G allele. |\n| • Knowledge of GGCX rs11676382 genotype has been incorporated in www.WarfarinDosing.org for pharmacogenetic dose initiation. |\n| • GGCX rs12714145 was not a significant predictor of warfarin dose |\n\nTable Caption: Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Snapshot: past, present and future.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis study was supported by the NIH (R01 HL074724, R01 HL097036, R01 HL57951, R01 HL58036) and the American Heart Association.\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n## References\n\n1.

AUD is polygenetic, with many genes likely contributing to AUD risk in different individuals, in different ways, and in interaction with the environment ([Buhler et al., 2015](#R7)). One strategy for increasing our understanding of genetic risk factors involved in AUD is the use of intermediate phenotypes for specific traits associated with the disorder. Intermediate phenotypes are those that: 1) are associated with risk for the disorder, 2) are associated with causes rather than effects of the disorder, 3) vary continuously in the general population, and 4) are detectable in unaffected family members of individuals with the disorder associated with that phenotype ([Bearden and Freimer, 2006](#R2)). The strength of studying intermediate phenotypes is that they may be less polygenic, and closer in proximity to genetic effects; this should increase statistical power to find gene associations with individual traits associated with AUD. Level of alcohol response meets basic criteria for an intermediate phenotype, and, as a result, alcohol administration under controlled human laboratory conditions is a useful tool to explore this genetic contribution to AUD risk ([Salvatore et al., 2015](#R44)).\n\nOne of the most common variants encoding the mu opioid receptor gene (OPRM1, gene ID 4988,) is a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (A118G SNP, rs1799971) ([Bond et al., 1998](#R5)). *In vitro* studies have shown that the minor allele (G) of this SNP is associated with a three-fold increase in binding affinity for the endogenous opioid peptide beta-endorphin ([Bond et al., 1998](#R5)), reduced receptor expression ([Zhang et al., 2005](#R62)), lower level of receptor glycosylation and a reduced receptor half-life ([Wang et al., 2012](#R59)). *In vivo* human PET imaging studies by our laboratory and others have corroborated the *in vitro* findings demonstrating that G allele carriers have lower mu-opioid receptor binding than AA homozygotes in alcohol dependent and healthy controls ([Weerts et al., 2013](#R60)), and in smokers and healthy controls ([Ray et al., 2011](#R43)). This SNP has been associated with AUD in some populations ([Setiawan et al., 2012](#R48)), and in some laboratory alcohol administration studies, G allele carriers showed increased subjective responses to alcohol consumption, enhanced reactivity to alcohol cues, and greater sensitivity to naltrexone reducing these effects ([Ray and Hutchison, 2004](#R41), [Ray and Hutchison, 2007](#R42), [van den Wildenberg et al., 2007](#R54))\n\nAs reviewed by [Gardner (2011)](#R13), the primary reward circuitry consists of an ‘in-series’ circuit linking the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum via the medial forebrain bundle. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) circuits include DAergic projections from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra to the ventral striatum (which contains the nucleus accumbens), limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate), and frontal cortex. The nucleus accumbens receives inputs from the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. In addition, the ventral striatum projects to the ventral pallidum and to the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, which, project back to the prefrontal cortex, via the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus ([Haber and Knutson, 2010](#R15)). Activation of mu opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area, or activation of mu opioid and delta opioid receptors via release of beta-endorphin and enkephalin in the nucleus accumbens increases extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens ([Gianoulakis, 2009](#R14)). DAergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum is also modulated via opioid peptide inputs in the hypothalamus. These interactions between opioid peptides and DA in the mesocorticolimbic circuit are thought to contribute to the rewarding effects of alcohol and the persistence of alcohol craving and consumption (for review see [Oswald and Wand, 2004](#R33)).\n\nOne possible source of the variability in prior studies examining the role of the A118G SNP in alcohol effects is a functional interaction between the A118G SNP and dopamine transporter gene (DAT1, gene ID SLC6A3) ([Anton et al., 2012](#R1)). The rationale for focusing on the DA transporter is its role in the regulation of DAergic transmission by clearing DA via uptake from the synaptic cleft. The DAT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q15.3 and contains a 40-base-pair variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in the 3′ untranslated region ([Vandenbergh et al., 1992](#R56)). A common VNTR polymorphism in DAT1 results in alleles with 10 and with 9 or lesser VNTRs (rs28363170). The 10-repeat allele (A10) is associated with higher DAT1 expression in the striatum than 9- or lesser-repeat alleles (A9), suggesting higher synaptic DA in A9 carriers ([Heinz et al., 2000](#R17)). The A9 has been associated with AUD ([Bhaskar et al., 2012](#R4)), and more severe alcohol-withdrawal symptoms ([van der Zwaluw et al., 2009](#R55)).\n\nIndeed, there is some evidence for functional interactions of the OPRM1 gene and the DA system. In human PET studies, striatal DA response to alcohol administration was limited to OPRM1 G carriers ([Ramchandani et al., 2011](#R37)); a similar response to smoked nicotine was observed ([Domino et al., 2012](#R9)). These studies did not evaluate DAT1 A9 vs A10 genotypes. Two recent exploratory studies provide some evidence for epistatic interactions between these two polymorphisms. Specifically, non-treatment seeking alcoholics who were carriers of both OPRM1 AA and DAT1 A9 alleles showed greater alcohol-induced stimulation to oral alcohol administration in a lab-bar, and improved drinking outcomes in response to naltrexone treatment ([Anton et al., 2012](#R1)). The second study in non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers reported that OPRM1 G carriers who were also DAT1 A10 homozygotes had steeper increases in alcohol-induced stimulation and vigor ([Ray et al., 2014](#R40)). Clearly, additional studies are needed to understand the independent vs. epistatic effects of DAT1 and OPRM1 genotypes.\n\nBuilding on this prior research the current study focused on whether DAT1 A9 and A10 genotypes independently or in epistatic interaction with the OPRM1 G-allele influence alcohol consumption, and subjective responses to orally administered alcohol in young, healthy, social drinkers. Our choice of candidate genotypes was based on 1) the well-established interactions between opioidergic and DAergic systems, 2) the demonstrated functional significance of the A118G SNP and the DAT VNTRs, and 3) prior exploratory studies showing epistatic interactions between OPRM1*G and DAT A9 vs A10 alleles. The two prior studies ([Anton et al., 2012](#R1), [Ray et al., 2014](#R40)) selected subjects based on prospectively determined A118G genotype, and then completed retrospective DAT1 genotyping on the selected subjects. To better understand of the role of DAT1 A9 vs A10 alleles in alcohol response, and examine epistatic interactions with OPRM1*G alleles, subjects in the current study were genotyped for both DAT1 (A9 vs A10) and OPRM1 (AA vs *G) genotypes after completion of the alcohol sensitivity sessions. We opted to study social drinkers rather than persons with AUD to minimize the effects of heavy alcohol exposure on outcome measures. Our apriori hypotheses were 1) DAT1 A9 carriers would show greater negative subjective effects of alcohol than A10 carriers independent of OPRM1 genotype, 2) that increased positive and stimulant subjective responses to alcohol in OPRM1 *G carriers would be dependent upon DAT1 A9 vs. A10 genotype. Since alcohol sensitivity differs depending on intensity and frequency of alcohol drinking, we also examined whether there were independent or epistatic genotype effects on self-reported measures of drinking outside the laboratory.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Subjects\n\nMale and female healthy volunteers between the ages of 21 and 30 were recruited for participation via newspaper, radio and other advertisements from the greater Baltimore area. Subjects who appeared to qualify for research participation based on a telephone screen were invited for an interview. Subjects provided written informed consent using a Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board approved informed consent document and then completed an in-person assessment interview with a Masters-level research assistant with experience in administrating structured diagnostic interviews. The interview included the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) ([Sheehan et al., 1998](#R49)) and/or the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA)([Bucholz et al., 1994](#R6)) to assess the presence or absence of drug and alcohol problems as well as other Axis I DSM IV disorders. Subjects completed a medical examination, with standard laboratory tests (i.e., complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis), and an alcohol breathalyzer test and urine toxicology screen. Recent patterns of alcohol consumption were determined via the 90-day Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) ([Sobell and Sobell, 1992](#R50)) administered by research staff who complete rigorous training and are recertified on the instrument at 6-month intervals. Subjects were excluded from study participation if they met current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for either drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, met current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for any Axis I disorder, had a positive urine drug toxicology test or urine pregnancy test (females) at screening or on test days, or had any ongoing health problems.\n\nTo minimize adverse reactions to alcohol administration, nondrinkers were excluded from study participation, and female and male participants met the following inclusion and criteria: report drinking at least two and three standard drinks, at least twice a month on the TLFB, and indicate some binge drinking (4 or more, or 5 or more drinks per occasion) respectively, in their past. Subjects whose weekly average alcohol intake exceeded NIAAA recommendations (i.e., >7 drinks/week for women or >14 drinks/week for men) were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were: (a) smoking 3 or more cigarettes per day, (b) current use of prescription medications and/or use of psychoactive medications within the past 90 days, (c) treatment in the last 6 months with antidepressants, neuroleptics, sedative hypnotics, glucocorticoids, appetite suppressants, opiates, or DA medications. A total of 145 subjects completed the alcohol sensitivity sessions. The Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board approved all procedures.\n\n### Laboratory Alcohol Sensitivity Procedures\n\nOn the session day, subjects arrived in the morning (9 am) and completed a urine toxicology screen, alcohol breathalyzer test, and urine pregnancy test; all individuals who participated in the study had negative findings. Subjects consumed a standardized 300 calorie breakfast and lunch to control for possible dietary effects on alcohol absorption, and completed within-session cumulative alcohol dosing (CAD) and a battery of subjective response instruments (see below). Breakfast was consumed two hrs. before the placebo drink, and lunch was consumed 45 min after the last alcohol drink (see below). Subjects were in a quiet laboratory room, and carefully monitored throughout the session. Following completion of the laboratory session, all subjects were admitted to the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Unit for monitoring of any alcohol reactions. Subjects were discharged the following morning as approved by the study physician.\n\n### Cumulative Alcohol Dosing (CAD)\n\nCAD was initiated between 11am and 12pm. Subjects consumed 1 placebo drink followed by 3 active alcohol drinks administered at 45-min intervals to progressively increase breath alcohol content (BAC) (0.03–0.1%) over 2 hrs. A terminal BAC of 0.1% was selected based on our experience in previous studies ([Turkkan et al., 1988](#R52), [Uhart et al., 2013](#R53)), and to target BAC reached during binge/heavy drinking. Doses for each subject were determined using a Computerized Blood Alcohol Calculator ([Fisher et al., 1987](#R11)) which adjusts for age, height, weight, gender differences in body water, and time spent drinking, to target similar BAC in males and females. The Johns Hopkins Investigational Drug Services prepared each 120 mL drink by mixing the appropriate mL of 95% ethanol (Spectrum Chemicals) in calorie-free Cherry Kool-Aid using a w/v metric. A placebo drink was utilized in order to account for expectation of alcohol effects that are independent of pharmacological effects of alcohol. Subjects were blind to the drink contents and were told “*During the session you will receive alcohol drinks or placebo drinks. Drinks may contain different amounts of alcohol*”. All drinks were blinded by floating 1 mL ethanol on top of the drink and by placing an ethanol-soaked wristband around the glass to deliver a strong alcohol odor. Subjects were instructed to sip each drink over a 10-min period, and were monitored by staff to ensure compliance. Medical personnel were available, if any adverse effects occurred (e.g., vomiting, dizziness). Early stopping rules were in effect; subjects could refuse drinks at any time, and additional drinks would not be administered if maximum BAC (0.1%) was reached, or adverse effects occurred. In the current study, none of the sessions was terminated early due to adverse effects, elevated BAC, or subject refusal of drinks.\n\n### Determination of Breath Alcohol Content (BAC)\n\nBAC was measured 15 minutes after consumption of placebo (+25) and each alcohol drink (+ 70, +115, +160) and then at 45 min intervals (+205, +250, + 295) until the end of the session using an Alco-Sensor IV Instrument (Intoximeters Inc., St Louis, MO). BAC results were not viewable by the participant, and they were not informed of BAC results.\n\n### Subjective response Assessment Instruments\n\nDuring the alcohol sensitivity procedure, subjects completed the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES) ([Martin et al., 1993](#R26)), the 13-item Subjective High Assessment Scale (SHAS) ([Schuckit, 1980](#R45)), Profile of Mood State Tension and Anxiety (POMS-TA) subscale ([McNair et al., 1992](#R28)), and the Drug Effects Questionnaire Visual Analog Scale (DEQ VAS) ([McCaul et al., 1990](#R27), [Preston and Bigelow, 1991](#R35)) using a laptop computer (see [Supplemental Methods A](#SD2).). For all instruments, subjects rated each item on how they felt “right now” at eight time points over a 5-hr period: at baseline (−25 min), five minutes after consumption of the placebo drink (+15), and each alcohol drink (+60, +105, +150 min), and at 45-minute intervals for the remainder of the session (+195, +240, +285 min).\n\n### Genotyping and Ancestry Informative markers (AIM)\n\nA total of 85 males and 42 females (n=127) completed the alcohol sensitivity sessions, consented to genetic sampling, and had adequate material for genotyping; Thirty-six of these subjects were included in a previous study ([Uhart et al., 2013](#R53)), which was completed using the same procedures, at the same site, with the same investigative team, and the same inclusion/exclusion criteria. Procedures for genotyping are in [Supplemental Methods B](#SD2). Based on known race/ethnicity differences in genotype frequency distributions ([Chen et al., 2012](#R8)), we determined genetic ancestry for each subject using AIM determined from a panel of 96 markers using GoldenGate Genotyping Assay ([Mahon et al., 2013](#R25)) and a set of 22 microsatellite markers, with allele 1 and allele 2 plus Duff-ag, which have a high efficiency at clustering individuals into population subgroups. Data were analyzed using Structure (v.2.3.2) ([Stephens et al., 2012](#R51)), and assumed a model with the possibility of admixture and correlated allele frequencies between populations; all other parameters were kept at their default values. In order to increase the accuracy of inferred genetic ancestry, the AIMs were used to generate component coordinates (C1 and C2) using a large data set (n=546), which included participants for the current study as well as other research participants who completed genotyping procedures for other studies conducted in our laboratory. Individual C1 and C2 coordinates were included in our statistical models as covariates.\n\nOPRM1 A118G SNP genotypes in our sample included A/A (n=94), A/G (n=31) and G/G (n=2). In these same subjects, DAT1 VNTR included 10/10 (n=63), 10/9 (n=50), 10/<9 (n=3), 9/9 (n=9) and <9/<9 (n=2). The frequency of the OPRM1 A allele was 219 (86.2%), and the G allele frequency was 35 (13.8%). DAT1 A10 frequency was 179 (70.5%) and DAT1 A9 frequency was 75 (29.5%). Hardy–Weinberg tests indicated OPRM1 and DAT1 genotype frequencies were in equilibrium. The expected Hardy-Weinberg frequencies are 94.4, 30.2, and 2.4 for OPRM1. The expected Hardy-Weinberg frequencies for DAT1 are 63.1, 52.9, and 11.1, respectively. The p-values were 0.759 for OPRM1 genotypes and 0.975 for DAT1 genotypes.\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nThe choice of statistical modeling was based on distribution of the data, and the assumptions of the statistical test. For all analyses, DAT1 genotype groups were carriers of 9 or less VNTR alleles (10/9, 10/<9, 9/9, and <9/<9) which were grouped together as A9, and 10 VNTR allele homozygotes (10/10) were grouped together as A10. For OPRM1, heterozygote (A/G) and homozygote (G/G) G-allele carriers were grouped together as *G and A allele homozygotes (A/A) were grouped together as AA. We tabulated the number of participants in each combined genotype subgroup: DAT1 A9/OPRM1*G, DAT1 A10/OPRM1*G, DAT1 A9/OPRM1 A/A, DAT1 A10/OPRM1 A/A. Chi-square test results didn’t show dependence between the frequency of the polymorphisms of the two genes ( χ12 = 0.065, p=0.799). That is, presence of one genotype did not predict presence of any other genotype.\n\nWe then examined whether OPRM1 and DAT1 genotypes, alone or in interaction with each other, were associated with differences in recent alcohol consumption or subjective effects of alcohol in the CAD procedure. Drinking data was not normally distributed across the 90-day period of the TLFB. We did not use log-transformations, as these do not address the bound range (0–90) and non-drinking days (0 drinks) do not transformed properly. Instead, we constructed three generalized linear regression models (GLRM) to examine three main TLFB measures: 1) average standard drinks per drinking day, 2) number of drinking days, and 3) number of heavy drinking days (i.e., 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men). Assuming the probability of a participant having a drink on any given day remains the same during the 90 day period, the total number of drinking days follows a binomial distribution (e.g., non-drinking day=0, drinking day=1). The same assumption and modeling was applied to number of heavy drinking days to determine the relative risk. The number of drinks per drinking day is counting data, and was modeled using a GLRM with Poisson distribution using log link function ([Nelder and Wedderburn, 1972](#R31), Kiernan et al., 2011) to determine the odds ratio. The independent variables included in the models were OPRM1 genotype, DAT1 genotype, and their interaction term, sex, AIM components (C1, C2) and their interaction term; sex and AIM components were included in the model to control for known sex and ancestral origin differences (covariates). The adjusted least square mean odds ratio (number of drinking days and number of heavy drinking days) or relative risk (number of drinks per drinking day) were calculated between genotypes and the interaction terms.\n\nWe further tested if CAD subjective measures were associated with OPRM1 and DAT1 polymorphisms. We constructed mixed-effect models with random intercept. The dependent variables in these models were BAES stimulation subscale, BAES sedation subscale, positive effects on DEQ VAS, and negative effects on DEQ VAS, SHAS score, and POMS-TA subscale. The independent variables included DAT1 genotype (A10 vs A9), OPRM1 genotype (AA vs *G), and time, as categorical variables; 2-order and 3-order interactions between DAT1 genotype, OPRM1 genotype, and time were also included in the model. Since there were genotype differences on pre-assessment TLFB drinking (see results), we included number of drinking days in all subsequent models as a covariate. Other covariates included were sex and AIM component values (C1, C2). We also compared the BAC peak and area under the curve (AUC) between the genotypes using GLRM.\n\nFor all analyses, we were testing specific hypotheses, and models were solved using SAS 9.4 mixed procedure. Specifically, DAT1 genotype, OPRM1 genotype, their interaction terms and covariates were all included in the models; we tested whether DAT1 and OPRM1 genotype independently or in epistatic interaction predicted subjective response scores on the SHAS, BAES stimulation and sedation subscales, DEQ VAS positive and negative effects subscales, and TLFB drinking measures (number of drinking days, number heavy drinking days and average drinks per drinking day). We ran full diagnosis on all the statistical models included in this manuscript to make sure all mathematical assumptions for the models were met and the models were valid. Significance level was set at P= 0.05, uncorrected. We were testing multiple correlated hypotheses, under carefully controlled testing conditions and number of subjects tested; given our sample size, we felt a Bonferroni correction would be too conservative for this exploratory analysis.\n\n## Results\n\n### Participant characteristics\n\nStudy subjects were young adult (mean age 24.3 years) males (66.9%) and females (33.1%), who were primarily Caucasian (72.4%) and were non-smokers (93.7%) or light smokers (< 2 days/week). There were no significant differences in demographic variables across genotype groups or subgroups with the exception of significant effects of self-reported race on the distribution of OPRM1 genotype, and OPRM1 × DAT1 subgroups ([Table 1a, b](#T1)). As shown in [Figure S1](#SD1), the distribution of AIM component scores (C1, C2) for individual subjects and self-reported race revealed three population clusters which generally aligned with the three primary self-reported race categories (Caucasian/white, African American/Black, and Asian). Since some individuals C1, C2 coordinates differed from their self-reported race, C1, C2 values were included in all statistical models to adjust for genetic race/ancestral differences.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | ALL | DAT1 |  |   | OPRM1 |  |   | DAT1 & OPRM1 |  |  |  |   |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | A10 | A9 | P | AA | AG/GG | P | A10 & AA | A10 &*G | A9 & AA | A9 & *G | P |  |  |\n| A.

Using the GLRM for genotype groups and their interaction for the three 90-day TLFB drinking measures, significant genotype and epistatic interactions for DAT1 and OPRM1 were found. The odds ratio of reporting more drinking days was significantly greater for A9 carriers vs A10 carriers ([Table 2a](#T2)). There was, however, a significant epistatic interaction, where OPRM1 *G allele appeared to attenuate the effects of the DAT1 A9 on number of drinking days ([Table 2a](#T2)). As shown in [Table 2b](#T2), the relative risk for drinks per drinking day did not show significant differences between genotype groups. As shown in [Table 2c](#T2), the odds ratio of heavy drinking days was significantly lower for OPRM1 *G carriers than for OPRM1 AA. There were no epistatic interactions between OPRM1 and DAT1 on number of heavy drinking days. Sex, which was included in all models as an apriori decision, was significant for number of drinking days (p=0.001), number of heavy drinking days (p=0.004) and number of drinks per drinking day (p=0.008).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| A.

The GLRM included OPRM1 genotype, DAT1 genotype groups, and their interaction terms, and adjusted for sex, and ancestral origin (C1,C2 coordinates). Results shown are the significance level (P) and the odds ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) or relative risk (95% confidence interval, CI) for (A) number of drinking days, (B) drinks per drinking day, and (C) number of heavy drinking days.

The values in the last column of the same row represent magnitude of the interaction.\n\n### Breath Alcohol Content (BAC)\n\nAs shown in [figure 1](#F1), BAC during the CAD followed a typical inverted U-shape function, and target BAC was reached (group mean ± SD = 0.105% ±0.2% BAC). There were no genotype differences in peak BAC or in area under the dose effect curve.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b0d9/5483245/c9dd9d092914/nihms866143f1.jpg)\n\nBreath Alcohol Content (BAC) during the cumulative alcohol dosing procedure.

Data points are slightly displaced on the x-axis for visual clarity.\n\n### Subjective response measures during cumulative alcohol dosing procedure\n\nThere was a significant main effect of alcohol across time for the POMS tension and anxiety subscale (F_7, 856_ = 3.05, p=0.004), BAES sedation (F_7, 856_ = 34.02, p<0.001), BAES stimulant (F_7, 856_ = 24.46, p <0.001), DEQ VAS positive (F_7, 856_ = 61.29, p<0.001), DEQ VAS negative (F_7, 856_ = 21.44, p<0.001), and SHAS scores (F_7, 856_ = 80.39, p<0.001). Mean DEQ VAS positive effects, BAES stimulation and SHAS scores increased progressively after the each alcohol drink, and peaked after consumption of all 3 alcohol drinks (135 min) when BAC peaked (0.1%). Mean DEQ VAS negative subjective effects, and BAES sedative scale scores increased and peaked on the descending limb of the BAC (270 min).\n\nThere was a significant 2-way time × DAT1 genotype interaction (F_7, 856_ = 2.79, p = 0.007) and a significant 3-way time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype interaction (F_7, 856_ = 2.32, p = 0.024) for SHAS scores (epistatic interaction). As shown in [figure 2](#F2), the DAT1 A9 carriers had higher SHAS scores across time points, when compared to the A10 carriers, and carriers of both DAT1A9 and OPRM1 *G alleles had the highest SHAS scores. In contrast, carriers of both DAT1A10 and OPRM1 *G alleles had lowest SHAS scores.\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b0d9/5483245/25345e844338/nihms866143f2.jpg)\n\nMean total SHAS scores reported at each time point during the cumulative alcohol dosing procedure. The x-axis is the time line for the session, and administration times of the placebo drink (P) and each active alcohol drink (A1, A2, A3) are indicated with arrows. Data are adjusted means (SEM) for each of the genotype subgroups. Means were adjusted for sex, AIMs and number of drinking days.\n\nWe completed several sensitivity analyses. First, we completed a sensitivity analysis in Caucasian subjects, as they were our largest racial demographic with sufficent numbers in all genotype groups. Similar effects were obtained; there was a significant 2-way interaction for time × DAT1 genotype (F_7, 613_ = 2.76, p = 0.011) and a significant 3-way interaction for time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype (F_7, 613_ = 2.69, p = 0.010) on SHAS scores. Second, we added BAC as a covariate and examined effects in all subjects and then in Caucasians only. Adding BAC, did not alter the findings. Specifically, when BAC was added to the model in all subjects, there was a significant 2-way interaction for time × DAT1 genotype (F_7, 801_ = 2.14, p = 0.037) and a significant 3-way interaction for time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype (F_7, 801_ = 2.28, p = 0.027) on SHAS scores. In Caucasians only, there was a significant 2-way interaction for time × DAT1 genotype (F_7, 591_ = 2.65, p = 0.011) and a significant 3-way interaction for time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype (F_7, 613_ = F_7, 591_ = 2.67, p = 0.010) on SHAS scores.\n\nThere was a significant 2-way interaction for time × DAT1 genotype (F_7, 856_ = 2.17, p = 0.035) on DEQ VAS negative scores. Across time points, the DAT1 A9 carriers had higher DEQ VAS negative scores when compared to the A10 carriers, independent of OPRM1 genotype. A significant 3-way interaction for time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype (F_7, 856_ = 2.31, p = 0.025) indicated an epistatic interaction; carriers of both DAT1 A9 and OPRM1 *G alleles had the highest DEQ VAS negative scores across time points ([Figure 3](#F3)).\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b0d9/5483245/1199e859ac0b/nihms866143f3.jpg)\n\nMean DEQ VAS negative scores reported at each time point during the cumulative alcohol dosing procedure. Other details as in Figure 2.\n\nWe repeated the same senstivity analyses as above for SHAS. In Caucasians, there was a significant 2-way time × DAT1 genotype interaction (F_7, 613_ = 2.20 p= 0.032) and a significant 3-way time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype interaction (F_7, 613_ = 2.50, p = 0.016) on DEQ VAS negative scores. Second, when we added BAC as a covariate and examined effects in all subjects and then in Caucasians only. Findings were similar. Specifically, in all subjects there was a significant 2-way interaction for time × DAT1 genotype (F_7, 801_ = 2.08, p = 0.043) and a significant 3-way interaction for time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype (F_7, 801_ = 2.46, p = 0.017) on DEQ VAS negative scores. In Caucasians only, there was a significant 2-way interaction for time × DAT1 genotype (F_7, 591_ = 2.18, p = 0.034) and a significant 3-way interaction for time × DAT1 gentype × OPRM1 genotype (F_7, 591_ = 2.41, p = 0.02) on DEQ VAS negative scores.\n\nThere were no significant 2-way or 3-way interactions effects on any of the other subjective measures (BAES stimulant or sedative scales, DEQ VAS positive score, or POMS tension anxiety scales) ([Figure 4](#F4)), and no significant independent effects of OPRM1 genotype for any of the subjective measures (all, p>0.1).\n\n### Figure 4.\n\n![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b0d9/5483245/eab19b2cebf2/nihms866143f4.jpg)\n\nMean total scores for A. stimulation and B. sedation subscales of the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES), C. positive effects on the Drug Effects Questionairre Visual Analog Scale (DEQ VAS), and D. the Tension and Anxiety subscale of the Profile of Mood States scale (POMS T&A) as reported at each time point during the cumulative alcohol dosing procedure. Other details as in Figure 2.\n\n## Discussion\n\nMajor genetic association findings of the current study pertain to subjective responses to alcohol and patterns of alcohol consumption. We detected an epistatic interaction between DAT1 and OPRM1 genotypes where the magnitude of subjective responses for OPRM1 *G carriers was dependent on which DAT1 VNTR was also present. Carriers of both DAT1 A9 and OPRM1 G alleles had higher SHAS and DEQ VAS negative scores when compared to the other three genotype subgroups. In contrast, carriers of both DAT1 A10 and OPRM1 G had the lowest SHAS scores. We did not identify an epistatic interaction between DAT1 and OPRM1 on alcohol-induced stimulation, sedation or the positive subjective effects of alcohol.\n\nA second novel finding of the current study was the independent and epistatic interactions of DAT1 and OPRM1 genes on recent drinking patterns as reported on the TLFB interview during the 90 days preceding the assessment interview. DAT1 A9 allele was associated with a greater number of drinking days, but this effect was attenuated in OPRM1 *G carriers. The OPRM1 *G allele was independently associated with fewer heavy drinking days, but did not affect average number of drinks per drinking day over the 90-day TLFB period. There were no epistatic effects of DAT1 A9 and OPRM1 *G genotypes on number of heavy drinking days or average number of drinks per drinking day.\n\nOur data provide further support for the importance of interactions between OPRM1 *G and DAT VNTR polymorphisms. Although early studies indicated *G allele carriers had higher subjective ratings of alcohol intoxication, stimulation, and positive mood across rising BAC than AA homozygotes ([Ray and Hutchison, 2004](#R41), [Ray and Hutchison, 2007](#R42), [Ray et al., 2013](#R38)), subsequent analyses indicated that effects were limited to *G-carriers who were also DAT1 A10 homozygotes ([Ray et al., 2014](#R40)). An opposite effect was reported by [Anton et al (2012)](#R1); non-treatment seeking alcoholics who were carriers of both OPRM1 AA and DAT1 A9 alleles showed greater alcohol-induced stimulation after consumption of a single priming drink. Although not significant in the current study, carriers of both OPRM1*G and DAT1 A10 had higher stimulation BAES scores as seen in the [Ray et al., 2013](#R38). Neither the Anton study nor the Ray study found genotype differences in sedative or negative subjective effects as found in the current study. It is notable that the overall sample of our current study (n=127) was three times larger, and the Caucasian sample (n=92) was twice as large as the prior study conducted by Ray and colleagues (n=43).\n\nWe recognize the current study has some key differences from prior studies that warrant consideration. First, there are differences in sampling techniques. Prior studies that examined OPRM1 A118G × DAT1 VTNR interactions used a combination of prospective and retrospective genotyping. Subjects were selected and matched based on prospective OPRM1 *G genotype and demographic variables, then DAT1 VTNR were retrospectively genotyped. In the current study, all genotyping was completed retrospectively (after the sensitivity sessions) and no one was excluded from participation based on genotype results. The advantage of prospective genotyping is the ability to increase the sample size for minor alleles through oversampling, and balanced genotype groups for testing genetic associations. The disadvantage is that the sample is not random, which may bias sampling in unknown ways, particularly when balancing groups and examining epistatic interactions between different genes. Second, there are differences in route, alcohol-dosing procedures (single bolus vs. cumulative dosing), and maximum BAC reached. Some prior studies have used the intravenous route and peak BAC levels are often less than 0.08%. The current study used oral alcohol administration, as this is the route in the natural environment. We also targeted a maximum BAC of 0.1% over 2 hours of drinking to mimic BAC reached during binge drinking. The higher BAC in the current study may be relevant for the greater sedative and aversive effects of alcohol, as detected by the SHAS and DEQ VAS, when compared to lower BAC achieved in some studies.\n\nTwo primary models have been proposed to describe the relationship of alcohol response and AUD risk, the low level of response (LLR) model and the differentiator model (DM) ([Morean and Corbin, 2010](#R30)). The LLR model proposes that individuals who experience decreased sensitivity to alcohol intoxication are at greater risk for AUD. In early longitudinal studies linking LLR and AUD risk, LLR was determined using the SHAS ([Schuckit and Smith, 2000](#R46)), which is primarily sensitive to the sedative and negative subjective effects of alcohol ([Ray et al., 2016](#R39)). In contrast, the DM addresses a broader range of alcohol effects. As reviewed by [King et al. (2011)](#R22), the DM proposes greater risk is associated with increased sensitivity to alcohol’s positive and stimulant effects on the ascending limb of the BAC curve, as well as decreased sensitivity to alcohol’s sedative and negative effects on the descending limb. DAT1 A9 and OPRM1*G carriers, who showed higher SHAS scores and greater negative effects of alcohol when compared to other genotype subgroups, would be at lower risk for AUD based on both the LLR and DM models. We did not, however, detect genotype differences for stimulation or positive subjective effects of alcohol, as would be predicted by the DM. This may reflect the quantitative and qualitative differences in stimulation and positive subjective effects in light/moderate drinkers vs. heavy drinkers as proposed by [Holdstock and colleagues (2000)](#R18). Following administration of 0.6 or 0.8 g/kg alcohol, light/moderate drinkers report greater negative effects and more sedation when compared to heavy drinkers, despite similar BAC (peak 0.06 and 0.08 g/dL). In this group of light/moderate social drinkers, the OPRM1 A118G SNP interacts with the DAT1 A9 vs. A10 allele to determine the sedative and negative effects of alcohol and drinking.\n\nTo date, the evidence for a role of the OPRM1 A118 SNP in AUD risk has been mixed, with different studies reporting higher or lower frequency of the G-allele in AUD populations ([Berrettini, 2015](#R3)). The associations of the OPRM1 G-allele in epistatic interactions with DAT1 A9 and. A10 alleles on alcohol sensitivity and heavy drinking frequency in the current study have important implications for AUD risk. Epidemiological studies have identified a strong relationship between frequency of binge and heavy drinking in young adulthood and risk for the development of an AUD later in life ([Hasin et al., 2001](#R16), [Jennison, 2004](#R19)). Moreover, excessive quantity and frequency of drinking also have strong genetic components, and are key factors contributing to AUD ([Kendler et al., 2012](#R20)). Thus, our data would suggest that the OPRM1 G allele in interaction with DAT1 A9 might contribute to protection against heavy drinking.\n\nClinical and preclinical data provide strong evidence that the rewarding and aversive effects of alcohol are mediated via interactions between opioid and dopamine systems. Acute alcohol induces release of endorphins and stimulates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, both of which correlate with subjective responses to alcohol ([Volkow et al., 2017](#R58)). Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens is regulated by the DAT and opioid inputs, and such interactions are thought to contribute to the positive and aversive subjective effects of alcohol, and patterns of alcohol consumption. Indeed, prior studies have shown decreased DAT1 expression and lower DAT availability in DAT1 A9 carriers than A10 homozygotes, consistent with increased dopaminergic tone in A9 carriers ([Mill et al., 2002](#R29), [Fuke et al., 2001](#R12), [Heinz et al., 2000](#R17)). The OPRM1 *G allele is associated with lower global mu-opioid receptor availability ([Ray et al., 2011](#R43), [Weerts et al., 2013](#R60)) and greater dopamine release in response to alcohol ([Ramchandani et al., 2011](#R37)), cigarette smoking ([Domino et al., 2012](#R9)), or pain ([Pecina et al., 2015](#R34)) challenges. The stimulatory effects of acute alcohol are also associated with its effects on dopamine release. Thus, it may be that the higher dopaminergic tone in DAT A9 carriers in interaction with OPRM1 genotype effects on mu opioid receptor function and dopamine neurotransmission in response to acute alcohol results in either enhanced (OPRM1*G carriers) or reduced (AA homozygotes) sensitivity to the sedative and aversive effects of alcohol.\n\nThe current study has a number of strengths, which help validate the findings and add to the growing literature on epistatic interactions between these polymorphisms. First, to extend beyond prior studies, we selected a population of social drinkers and controlled for individual differences in recent drinking in our analyses. Prior studies have established that there are differences in alcohol response in the laboratory, which are dependent on prior drinking behavior in the community. Heavy drinkers reported greater acute positive subjective effects and stimulation, and less sedative effects when compared to social drinkers administered controlled doses of alcohol ([King et al., 2011](#R22)). Social drinkers reported greater “high” than heavy drinkers after ingesting high ethanol doses (0.56–1 g/kg), and time since last drink altered responses to acute alcohol administration ([Turkkan et al., 1988](#R52)). Second, we restricted smoking in our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the impact of nicotine use and dependence. Both the OPRM1 A118G SNP and DAT1 VTNR polymorphism have been associated with nicotine initiation, use and dependence ([Verhagen et al., 2012](#R57)). Smoking also has been shown to alter availability of both DA D2 receptors and mu opioid receptors in the brain ([Scott et al., 2007](#R47), [Weerts et al., 2014](#R61)). By excluding regular smokers, we reduced the possible impact of cigarette smoking on opioid and dopamine receptors, and downstream opioid and dopamine effects on alcohol sensitivity. Third, the current study adjusted for key biological variables such as sex and ancestral origin in our analyses. Importantly, the study of the intermediate phenotype of subjective alcohol response in populations that span the continuum of alcohol consumption patterns ranging from social drinkers to the chronic relapsing heavy drinker is consistent with NIH research domain criteria objectives ([Ray et al., 2016](#R39), [Litten et al., 2015](#R23)). Such an approach is also supported by [Bearden and Freimer (2006)](#R2), since meaningful phenotypes should vary continuously in the general population (i.e. normal distribution). Examination of alcohol response across different populations is critical to our understanding of the strength of genetic associations with individual differences in alcohol response.\n\nWe acknowledge there are limitations in the study. First, while sample size is relatively large for alcohol challenge studies, it is small with regard to genetic analysis. Second, the sample size for genotype groups was insufficient for analysis of data disaggregated by sex or race/ancestral origin, or for correction for testing multiple hypotheses. Sex-related effects of OPRM1 G allele have been shown for experimental pain thresholds ([Fillingim et al., 2005](#R10)), magnitude of cortisol response to pharmacological blockade of the mu-opioid receptor by naloxone ([Lovallo et al., 2015](#R24)), and alcohol-induced DA release ([Ramchandani et al., 2011](#R37)). Third, the frequency of the OPRM1 G-allele differs substantially across different race/ethnicities ([Oroszi and Goldman, 2004](#R32)). To address this concern, sex and ancestral origin were covariates in our analyses. We also completed sensitivity analyses with the subsample of Caucasian participants. Fourth, focusing on two genotypes out of many does not account for the influence of other genes that affect alcohol sensitivity and consumption, or possible bias due to genome wide polygenic effects. For example, genetic polymorphisms of GABA_A_ -α_2_ receptors, and GAB_AA_-α_6_ receptors, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptors, and the serotonin transporter have been reported to affect alcohol response (for review see [Uhart et al., 2013](#R53), [Radel and Goldman, 2001](#R36), [Ray et al., 2016](#R39)). It is also important to consider that other OPRM1 and DAT1 gene variants may also contribute to individual differences in alcohol response, and that nonsystematic variations in genotype frequency, sampling techniques, and variation in LD structure with other risk loci across studies may be significant factors. Fifth, the laboratory cumulative alcohol dosing procedure also may affect subjective responses. The procedure used a standard volume drink containing Kool-Aid and grain alcohol, with each drink consumed within 10 minutes, and drinks administered at regular intervals over 2 hour period. While these procedures permit blinding of the placebo drink, controlled dosing and BAC achieved, drinks are less palatable than an individual’s preferred drink, and the timing of consumption may be slower or faster than it would be in the natural environment. Despite these caveats, this carefully controlled laboratory study provides evidence of a role of the DAT1 VNTR polymorphism in alcohol response, and supports future examinations of epistatic interactions between DAT1 and OPRM1 genes in larger studies. Validity of these findings would be strengthened by the examination of the same genes in different populations, as well as replication in the same population. Future studies should expand sampling to better address biological variables like sex and racial/ethnic differences, and systematically investigate factors that may influence findings (e.g., magnitude of recent alcohol use and tolerance, co-morbid cigarette smoking or other drug use in heavy drinkers)\n\nThe current study provides support for the influence of the interactive effects of DAT1 and OPRM1 genes on subjective effects and patterns of alcohol consumption. Novel findings were the epistatic interactions between OPRM1*G and DAT1 A9 alleles on alcohol drinking frequency and negative subjective effects of alcohol. The current findings do not, however, provide any evidence of interactive effects of OPRM1 and DAT1 genotypes on the stimulant or positive subjective effects of alcohol in social drinkers. If replicated in a larger sample, these data suggest a modest protective effect of the OPRM1 gene in epistatic interaction with the DAT1 gene. These findings also may help explain some of the variability in results observed in prior studies of the OPRM1 A118G polymorphism. In conclusion, these findings highlight the biological importance of interactions between these two genes, and by extension interactions between brain opioid and dopamine systems in modulating individual differences in alcohol response.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nSupported by NIH grants R01AA012837 (ME McCaul), R01AA10158 and R01MH076953 (GS Wand), R01AA017704 (EM Weerts) and U01AA020890 (GS Wand and ME McCaul).\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n## References\n\n1.

Pharmacokinetic characteristics are often associated with clinical endpoints, such as fasting glucose levels after exposure to anti-diabetic medications or viral suppression after exposure to antiretroviral agents [[1](#R1),[2](#R2)]. One of the most robust examples of a pharmacokinetic association is observed with genetic variation in the cytochrome p450 2B6 gene (CYP2B6) [[1](#R1)-[2](#R2)], whose protein product is an enzyme that metabolizes an array of medications [[3](#R3)], including bupropion, tamoxifen, propofol, and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) efavirenz and nevirapine that are used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n\nSeveral CYP2B6 loss-of-function alleles are associated with pharmacokinetic characteristics of NNRTIs [[4](#R4),[5](#R5)]. Particularly, consistent associations of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs3475274 and rs28399499, have been observed individually with plasma and intracellular NNRTI levels [[4](#R4)-[14](#R14)] and to a lesser degree with clinical response [[10](#R10)-[15](#R15)]. The CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotype, derived from the composite genotype for rs3745274 and rs28399499, categorizes individuals as extensive, intermediate, and slow metabolizers of CYP2B6 substrates [[16](#R16)-[18](#R18)]. The metabolizer phenotype predicts efavirenz [[16](#R16),[17](#R17)] and nevirapine [[16](#R16)] plasma concentrations. Regarding clinical response, an association between the metabolizer phenotype and virologic failure, defined as two consecutive HIV viral load measures ≥ 200 copies/ml, in African-Americans has been suggested [[18](#R18)].\n\nConfounding by race/ethnicity is a concern in all genetic association studies and the two variants comprising the CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotype may be particularly susceptible to this type of confounding. Substantial differences in minor allele frequencies for these two SNPs occur across racial/ethnic groups [[5](#R5)-[8](#R8)] and race/ethnicity has often been associated with pharmacokinetic parameters and treatment responses [[19](#R19)]. Gross confounding by race/ethnicity (population stratification) can be addressed by adjusting statistical models for self-reported ethnicity, but cryptic relatedness and admixture require more detailed genetic ancestry data to guard against false positive or false negative results [[20](#R20)-[24](#R24)]. Such cryptic relatedness occurs in seemingly homogenous populations within the same self-reported race/ethnicity group [[24](#R24)]. In theory, affected individuals (cases) may be more related to one another than controls and as a result the allelic distribution among cases may be skewed [[24](#R24)].\n\nSpurious associations can also occur in a study population that contains individuals from a single ethnic group that has experienced recent genetic admixture [[25](#R25),[26](#R26)]. Varying proportions of ancestry from distinct ‘parental’ populations contribute to a population's genome; admixture describes this mosaic of genetic ancestry. Admixture is particularly evident in African-American and Hispanic-American populations [[27](#R27)-[29](#R29)]. For example, among African-Americans from different geographical regions in the United States (U.S.), European ancestry varies between 11.6% and 22.5%; the remaining proportion includes African and Native American ancestry [[27](#R27)]. Thus, addressing population substructure in genetic association studies beyond adjustment for self-reported race/ethnicity is critical to protect against potentially spurious results.\n\nThe Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) is a multi-ethnic cohort study of HIV-infected and uninfected women who have been followed every six months since 1995. We report here the association between genetic variation in CYP2B6 and virologic response to initial antiretroviral therapy regimens containing a NNRTI. Simultaneously, population substructure was characterized using a panel of ancestry informative markers (AIM) selected to distinguish between European, West African, Asian, and Native American ancestry [[30](#R30)]. CYP2B6 genetic associations were used to demonstrate that residual confounding may exist when underlying genetic structure is ignored.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### \n\n#### WIHS Study Design\n\nThe WIHS is a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected women and a comparison group of HIV-uninfected women. Participants were recruited from six sites across the U.S., located in Bronx/Manhattan, New York; Brooklyn, New York; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles, California; San Francisco/Bay Area, California; and Chicago, Illinois. Enrollment was conducted in two phases; 2 054 HIV seropositive and 569 seronegative women were enrolled in 1994-1995 and 737 HIV seropositive and 406 seronegative women were enrolled from 2000-2001. A more detailed description of the WIHS cohort has been published elsewhere [[31](#R31),[32](#R32)].\n\n#### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nHIV-infected women who consented to genetic studies, initiated antiretroviral therapy containing a NNRTI during study follow-up, maintained a three drug HAART regimen at the subsequent visit, had HIV RNA measurements at the visit immediately prior to, the visit of, and the visit immediately after initiating a NNRTI-containing regimen were eligible for this study. Women who were treated with antiretroviral drugs prior to reporting treatment with a NNRTI were excluded to limit the inclusion of women infected with a virus that might have acquired resistance to antiretroviral agents. A total of 100 subjects met these study criteria and were genotyped on CYP2B6 SNPs.\n\n#### Virologic Response\n\nHIV viral loads were quantified with an assay with a lower limit of detection of 80 HIV RNA copies/ml. A positive virologic response (“responders”) was defined as achievement of an undetectable viral load at the visit during which the NNRTI regimen was first reported or at the visit subsequent to it, which corresponds to a maximum of 54 weeks of treatment. Participants not achieving an undetectable viral load at the visit of first reported NNRTI regimen use (in the previous six months) or subsequent visit were classified as “non-responders”. This definition conforms to clinical guidelines for treatment with antiretroviral regimens [[33](#R33)].\n\n#### SNP Selection\n\nCYP2B6 pharmacogenetic association studies in the literature were queried to obtain a list of polymorphisms located in the exons, 3′ UTR, 5′ UTR and splice sites (i.e. putative functional polymorphisms). From this list, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 5% or higher were scored for assay performance on Illumina's GoldenGate® genotyping platform (San Diego, CA). A total of 11 CYP2B6 SNPs were selected: rs3211370, rs3211397, rs36079186, rs34128717, rs3211374, rs3211371, rs8192709, rs34097093, rs1042389, rs3745274, and rs28399499.\n\n#### Genotyping and Quality Control\n\nData for the eleven CYP2B6 SNPs were generated as a subset of a larger genotyping panel (n=384 SNPs). Four of the eleven CYP2B6 SNP assays (rs3211370, rs3211397, rs36079186, rs34128717) did not generate three distinct genotypes and were deemed failures. Of the remaining seven SNPs that were successfully genotyped, rs3211374 was monomorphic (no variants observed) in all race/ethnic groups and excluded from the analysis. In total, six CYP2B6 polymorphisms (rs3211371, rs8192709, rs34097093, rs1042389, rs3745274, and rs28399499) passed the QC criterion of successful genotyping on 89.5% of the samples. Five of the 100 subjects genotyped (5%) did not pass the QC criterion of <10% missing genotype data and were excluded from the analysis. QC for the entire panel is described in [supplementary information](#SD1).\n\n### Characterization of Genetic Ancestry in the WIHS\n\n#### Selection of AIMs, Genotyping and Quality Control\n\nA subset of markers that were originally identified by Smith and colleagues was utilized to distinguish between West African, European, East Asian, and Native American populations [[30](#R30)]. All subjects in the WIHS cohort who consented to genetic studies and had DNA available were characterized for genetic ancestry as these markers are being used for all genetic association studies being conducted in the WIHS. A total of 185 AIMs were selected as part of a larger panel (n=384); 168 (91%) AIMs passed the QC criterion of successful genotyping on 89.5% of the samples Four of 100 eligible subjects did not pass the QC criterion of <10% missing genotype data and were excluded from the analysis. QC for the entire panel is described in [supplementary information](#SD1).\n\n#### Estimation of Genetic Ancestry Components\n\nIndividual genetic ancestry proportions for 2 318 WIHS women were inferred using the software package STRUCTURE 2.3.1 [[22](#R22),[34](#R34)], which employs a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo clustering algorithm. A 30 000 repetition burn-in period and 10 000 subsequent iterations for different values of *k* (number of assumed subpopulations, *k*=3-6) were initiated under the admixture model with independent allele frequencies. Four independent simulations for each value of *k* were performed to ensure that estimates were consistent across runs. The admixture model with the greatest log likelihood for each value of *k* was selected. HapMap2 and HapMap3 [[35](#R35)] reference population data on 168 AIMs and 105 AIMs, respectively, were included in the STRUCTURE analyses to increase the accuracy of admixture estimation [[36](#R36)]. Results were formatted and graphically displayed using the *Distruct* 1.1 software package [[37](#R37)].\n\nGenetic ancestry components were also evaluated with principal components analysis on the WIHS genotype data for 168 AIMs (n=2 318) following the method used with the EIGENSTRAT software [[38](#R38),[39](#R39)]. Adjusting for PCs is the preferred method to control for population substructure, as the model does not depend on an assumption of the number of source populations [[38](#R38),[39](#R39)]. PCs were used in the models examining the association between CYP2B6 genotypes and virologic response to therapy.\n\n#### Statistical Analysis\n\nThe final dataset consisted of 91 subjects meeting study inclusion and exclusion criteria and with complete data for CYP2B6 and AIM SNPs. Logistic regression was used to test associations between each CYP2B6 polymorphism and virologic response. Odds ratios (OR) per allele and 95% CIs were estimated by modeling the genotypes as an ordinal variable, where common allele homozygotes, heterozygotes and minor allele homozygotes were coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. This log-additive model provides a p-value for corresponding test of the trend for increased probability of virologic response per allele.\n\nCYP2B6 metabolizer phenotypes were constructed using two polymorphisms, rs3745274 and rs28399499, to test the association between the metabolizer phenotype and virologic response. Women who were common allele homozygotes at rs3745274 and rs28399499 (GG and TT, respectively) were coded as 0 “extensive metabolizers”. Women with one heterozygote genotype and one common allele homozygote genotype at either polymorphism were coded as 1 “intermediate metabolizers”. Women with a total of two minor alleles (one minor allele homozygote genotype, or two heterozygote genotypes) across both SNPs were coded as 2 “slow metabolizers”. No women carried one minor allele at one SNP and two minor alleles at the other SNP, or four minor alleles across the two SNPs.\n\nMetabolizer phenotype-specific ORs and 95% CIs for intermediate metabolizers and slow metabolizers compared with extensive metabolizers, were estimated with exact logistic regression, since there were zero non-responders with the slow metabolizer phenotype. Additionally, the metabolizer phenotype was treated as an ordinal variable to obtain the exact p for trend. Nominal p-values are reported throughout the manuscript.\n\nTo assess the potential confounding effects of population substructure, models were fit unadjusted, adjusted for self-reported race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, African American, Hispanic, and Asian/Other), and adjusted for genetic ancestry principal components. The three most important PCs that accounted for the largest change in the main effect β in the individual SNP analyses were included in the metabolizer phenotype model.\n\nSelf-reported adherence was also evaluated as a potential confounder (change in the genotype main effect β of 10% or more was considered confounding). Adherence data were taken at the visit at which the participant achieved the virologic response outcome since the adherence variable at this visit reflects treatment adherence in the six months leading up to the visit in which the outcome was achieved. For modeling purposes, adherence was dichotomized as ≥ 95% adherent and < 95% adherent from original categories as collected (100%, 95-99%, 75-95%, <75%).\n\n## Results\n\n### \n\n#### Detection of population substructure\n\n[Figure 1](#F1) illustrates the individual ancestry proportions for 2 318 WIHS participants (n=1 796 HIV seropositive and n=522 seronegative) by self-reported ethnic groups for *k*=4 cluster STRUCTURE models (results for self-reported Asian, Native American and ‘other’ groups are not illustrated due to small numbers). In summary, the WIHS women likely descended from four source populations, European, Asian, Yoruban, and non-Yoruban African ancestry. Admixture was estimated by including reference population data from HapMap2 ([Fig. 1A](#F1)) and HapMap3 ([Fig. 1B](#F1)). Assuming *k*=4 subpopulations (log likelihood= -449 517.3), the fourth subpopulation (yellow) was represented in WIHS African-American and Hispanic women, but was not substantially present in Yoruban, European, or East Asian reference populations ([Fig. 1A](#F1)). The *k*=4 model suggests that there is ancestry in the WIHS that is not represented in the HapMap2 populations. Assuming *k*=4 subpopulations (log likelihood= -358 970.2) with HapMap3 data, the fourth subpopulation (orange) was over-represented in the Maasai Kenyans, in which the average proportion of ancestry attributed to the fourth subpopulation was 79% ([Fig. 1B](#F1)). Since the Maasai population show admixture with Yoruban ancestry (12%), the fourth component was labeled as non-Yoruban African ancestry. The HapMap3 Mexican-American population shows a considerable amount of admixture represented by the Asian subpopulation, which was inferred to represent Native American ancestry as Native American ancestry is correlated with East Asian ancestry [[40](#R40)].\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0602/3940150/4539b38fc0fd/nihms505974f1a.jpg)\n\nIndividual ancestry proportions for self-reported WIHS ethnic groups and HapMap populations.

In contrast to African-Americans and Whites, ancestry proportions in Hispanics varied across sites. There was a gradient of decreasing European ancestry and increasing Asian ancestry in Hispanics from East to West. Additionally, African admixture (Yoruban and non-Yoruban) was substantial in Hispanics in New York (0.13-0.19) but minimal among Los Angeles Hispanics (0.03-0.04).\n\nWhile estimating ancestry proportions using STRUCTURE is beneficial to labeling subpopulations for ease of interpretation, PCs are preferred as ancestry covariates in statistical models. Graphical display of the PCs illustrate the separation of broad ethnic groups and the dispersion of individuals along the axes confirms the variation that exists within self-reported ethnic groups as seen in [Figure 1](#F1). [Figure 2](#F2) shows the plot of PC1 vs. PC2 with color-coded self-reported ethnic groups. PC1 (x-axis) separates African vs non-African ancestry and PC2 (y-axis) separates Hispanic vs non-Hispanic ancestry.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0602/3940150/43f63eb8b08b/nihms505974f2.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3940150_nihms505974f2.jpg)\n\nPrincipal component (PC) 1 vs. PC 2 for WIHS women (n=2 318) from analysis on 168 ancestry informative markers.

The median viral load measured at the visit prior to first report of a NNRTI was 28 000 copies/ml (IQR 6 300-110 000) for responders and 45 000 copies/ml (IQR 13 000-69 000) for non-responders (Kruskal-Wallis test p=0.57). Nearly all of the non-responders (n=18/21) reported having African-American race/ethnicity and the remaining three women reported having Hispanic race/ethnicity. Among the responders (N=70), 53% self-reported as African-American, 31% as White, and 7% as Hispanic.\n\nThe genotype frequencies by responder status and MAF by self-reported ethnicity are given in [Table 1](#T1) for the six SNPs that were successfully genotyped. There were no non-responders among carriers of the minor allele for rs3211371 and therefore effect estimates could not be calculated. The six SNPs were not in linkage disequilibrium (r^2^ ≥ 0.80) in any of the WIHS self-reported racial/ethnic groups ([Supplementary Figure 1](#SD1)).\n\n|   |   |   | Minor Allele Frequency |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CYP2B6 SNP2 | Responders (%) | Non-responders (%) | African American (n=55) | White (n=22) | Hispanic (n=8) | Other3 (n=6) |\n| rs3211371 |   |   | 0.03 | 0.07 | 0 | 0 |\n| CC | 63 (90) | 21 (100) |   |   |   |   |\n| CT | 6 (10) | 0 |   |   |   |   |\n| TT | 0 | 0 |   |   |   |   |\n| missing | 1 | 0 |   |   |   |   |\n| rs3409703 |   |   | 0.22 | 0 | 0 | 0.08 |\n| TT | 52 (76) | 14 (74) |   |   |   |   |\n| TC | 16 (24) | 4 (21) |   |   |   |   |\n| CC | 0 | 1 (5) |   |   |   |   |\n| missing | 2 | 2 |   |   |   |   |\n| rs1042389 |   |   | 0.25 | 0.14 | 0.21 | 0.08 |\n| TT | 46 (66) | 13 (62) |   |   |   |   |\n| TC | 21 (30) | 7 (33) |   |   |   |   |\n| CC | 3 (4) | 1 (5) |   |   |   |   |\n| rs8192709 |   |   | 0.06 | 0 | 0.07 | 0 |\n| CC | 64 (91) | 20 (95) |   |   |   |   |\n| CT | 6 (9) | 1 (5) |   |   |   |   |\n| TT | 0 | 0 |   |   |   |   |\n| rs3745274 |   |   | 0.28 | 0.24 | 0.21 | 0.33 |\n| GG | 32 (46) | 14 (67) |   |   |   |   |\n| GT | 34 (48) | 7 (33) |   |   |   |   |\n| TT | 4 (6) | 0 |   |   |   |   |\n| rs28399499 |   |   | 0.10 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| TT | 62 (88) | 19 (90) |   |   |   |   |\n| TC | 7 (10) | 2 (10) |   |   |   |   |\n| CC | 1 (2) | 0 |   |   |   |   |\n\nTable Caption: Frequency counts for genotypes by virologic responder status1 and minor allele frequencies by self-reported race/ethnic group in 91 HIV-infected women treated with NNRTIs (efavirenz or nevirapine).\n\nThe associations between the remaining five SNPs (rs3409703, rs1042389, rs8192709, rs3745274 and rs28399499) and response to a NNRTI-based regimen are shown in [Table 2](#T2). Overall, no statistically significant associations between these five SNPs and virologic response were observed after adjustment for self-reported race/ethnicity (second column). However, a high magnitude of effect on virologic response was observed for the two SNPs which comprise the metabolizer phenotype (rs3745274 and rs28399499) after adjustment for genetic ancestry PCs and the effect of rs3745274 reached statistical significance (p-trend =0.03).\n\n|   | Crude | Adjusted for SR Race/Ethnicity3 | Adjusted for top three PCs4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CYP2B6 SNP2 | OR (95% CI) | OR (95% CI) | OR (95% CI) |\n| rs34097093 |   |   |   |\n| per C allele | 0.70 (0.25-1.99) | 1.21 (0.39-3.77) | 1.25 (0.37-4.22) |\n| p trend | 0.50 | 0.74 | 0.72 |\n| rs1042389 |   |   |   |\n| per C allele | 0.88 (0.38-2.03) | 1.14 (0.46-2.84) | 1.13 (0.43-2.94) |\n| p trend | 0.76 | 0.77 | 0.80 |\n| rs81927095 |   |   |   |\n| CC | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |\n| CT | 1.87 (0.21-16.52) | 3.35 (0.38-29.90) | 2.96 (0.30-28.87) |\n| rs3745274 |   |   |   |\n| per T allele | 2.42 (0.93-6.30) | 2.49 (0.90-6.88) | 3.61 (1.16-11.22) |\n| p trend | 0.07 | 0.08 | 0.03 |\n| rs28399499 |   |   |   |\n| per C allele | 1.32 (0.30-5.91) | 2.23 (0.47-10.61) | 3.63 (0.69-19.18) |\n| p trend | 0.71 | 0.31 | 0.13 |\n\nTable Caption: Associations between CYP2B6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and with virologic response1 to NNRTI-based regimens in women who were naïve to antiretroviral drugs (N=91).\n\nWhen considering the joint effects of the two SNPs, intermediate and slow metabolizers were 2.90 (95% CI 0.79-12.28) and 13.44 (95% CI 1.66-infinity) times as likely to respond to NNRTIs compared to extensive metabolizers after adjustment for genetic ancestry PCs (p-trend =0.005; [Table 3](#T3)). Substantial evidence of confounding is present with the metabolizer phenotype when comparing the crude, self-reported ethnicity-adjusted and genetic ancestry PCs-adjusted estimates. After adjustment for self-reported race/ethnicity, the OR for slow metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers increased by 54%. After adjustment for genetic ancestry PCs, the confounding effect of population substructure was further reduced; the OR for slow metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers increased by 169% over the unadjusted estimate and by 75% over the self-reported race/ethnicity estimate. PC1, which separates African vs. non-African ancestry, explained most of the confounding, in which the crude estimate changed by 55% after including PC1 in the model. Adjustment for PC9 increased the PC1-adjusted estimate by 19% and PC7 accounted for an additional 4% increase thereafter. The level of confounding attributable to population substructure is not surprising given the appreciable heterogeneity that exists within each self-reported race/ethnicity group ([Figures 1](#F1) and [2](#F2)).\n\n| Metabolizer Phenotype2 | Responders (%) | Non-responders (%) | Crude | Adjusted for SR Race/Ethnicity3 | Adjusted for top three PCs4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OR (95% CI) | OR (95% CI) | OR (95% CI) |  |  |  |\n| Extensive | 28 (40) | 12 (57) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |\n| Intermediate | 33 (47) | 9 (43) | 1.56 (0.52-4.88) | 1.66 (0.47-6.11) | 2.90 (0.79-12.28) |\n| Slow | 9 (13) | 0 | 5.00 (0.70-inf) | 7.69 (1.04-inf) | 13.44 (1.66-inf) |\n| p trend exact |   |   | 0.09 | 0.04 | 0.005 |\n\nTable Caption: Estimates for the association between the CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotype (using rs3745274 and rs28399499) with virologic response1 to NNRTI-based HAART regimens in women who were naïve to antiretroviral drugs (N=91).\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe observed a statistically significant association between the CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotype (joint effect of rs3745274 and rs28399499) and virologic response to NNRTI-based antiretroviral regimens (p-trend =0.005). This association was strongly confounded by underlying population substructure for which adjustment of self-reported race/ethnicity was not a sufficient control. Our findings confirm prior report of the role of these SNPs in NNRTI metabolism and further highlight the importance of controlling for population substructure using genetic ancestry estimates, such as PCs, in genetic association studies.\n\nIt is possible that both genetic ancestry estimates and self-reported race/ethnicity may confound the association between SNPs and outcome, as would be seen if the additional factors captured by self-reported ethnic group (e.g. socio-economic status) are also associated with the SNP of interest. However, adjusting for both PCs and self-reported race/ethnicity did not change the estimated effect of CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotype on virologic response to NNRTIs compared to PCs alone. These findings suggest that PCs alone capture the underlying population substructure and the additional factors related to self-identification in a particular ethnic group are not associated with these SNPs.\n\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to report a statistically significant joint effect of rs3745274 and rs28399499 (metabolizer phenotype) on virologic response to NNRTIs in a multi-ethnic observational study of HIV-infected women. Previously, a study of participants randomized to efavirenz in the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG), of which 19% were female and 34% were African-American, explored the effect of the metabolizer phenotype on virologic failure [[18](#R18)]. The incidence of virologic failure adjusted for the competing event of efavirenz discontinuation was lower among self-reported African American participants with the slow metabolizer phenotype (p=0.02) [[18](#R18)]. However, this effect was not seen in Whites or Hispanics, which is likely an artifact of the lower allele distribution in non-African Americans. The authors reported that the results were similar after incorporation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) PCs, though it is unclear whether this model was tested in all participants.\n\nThe two polymorphisms that contribute to the CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotype are functionally relevant. The minor allele (T) at rs3745274 causes an aberrant splicing mechanism that decreases expression and activity of CYP2B6 in the liver [[41](#R41)]. The minor allele (C) at rs28399499 has been consistently associated with reduced CYP2B6 expression [[1](#R1),[7](#R7)], though the mechanism is unclear [[41](#R41)]. Additionally, it is well established that both SNPs predict several short-term NNRTI pharmacokinetic parameters, such as AUC, oral clearance, and half-life [[4](#R4)-[18](#R18),[42](#R42)]. In a separate WIHS study, carriers of the TT genotype compared to GG and GT genotypes at rs3745274 experienced an over 3-fold increase (p=1.0 × 10^-10^) in efavirenz concentration in hair specimens after adjustment for non-genetic predictors of long-term efavirenz exposure (e.g. adherence and consumption of orange juice) [[39](#R39)]. The minor allele C at rs28399499 was associated with a 1.70 fold increase of efavirenz levels in hair (p=0.02) [[43](#R43)]. The independent associations of these SNPs with long-term exposure to efavirenz lends support to our results of increased probability of virologic suppression in intermediate and slow metabolizers through the mechanism of sustained increased drug levels.\n\nA limitation of this study is the absence of viral genotyping on pre-NNRTI specimens from each participant, which would allow us to limit exclusion of treatment-experienced NNRTI users to those who are resistant to NNRTIs. There is no reason to believe that the exclusion of treatment-experienced women who reported initial treatment with a NNRTI would bias the results away from the null. Another limitation of our study is the small sample size, however, we observed a robust and statistically significant association that survived a Bonferroni correction for the number of tests we performed (corrected α=0.05/6 = 0.008). The functional role of the SNPs comprising the metabolizer phenotype and associations within and external to the WIHS with pharmacokinetic parameters is compelling enough to assign a high prior probability that this association is real.\n\nAlthough patients with CYP2B6 intermediate and slow metabolizer phenotypes are more likely to achieve undetectable viral loads after treatment with NNRTIs in our study, it is possible that the low grade toxicities that are experienced in carriers of the minor allele at rs3745274 [[4](#R4),[9](#R9)] could impact adherence to NNRTIs over time or result in drug-switching. This is an area of active research in the WIHS. Nevertheless, the association of the CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotype and response to NNRTIs has important potential for clinical decision-making, in which the genetic profile of an individual is taken into account prior to the initiation of a given antiretroviral agent. In fact, this paradigm has already been implemented with the antiretroviral agent, abacavir, in which acquisition of genetic information is highly recommended prior to the institution of this drug, in order to avoid potential hypersensitivity reactions [[44](#R44)]. The body of evidence supporting a role for CYP2B6 SNPs in NNRTI virologic response suggests that further study is warranted to determine whether this information can be used in clinical in decision making related to antiretroviral regimens.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nData in this manuscript were collected by the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Collaborative Study Group with centers (Principal Investigators) at New York City/Bronx Consortium (Kathryn Anastos); Brooklyn, NY (Howard Minkoff); Washington DC, Metropolitan Consortium (Mary Young); The Connie Wofsy Study Consortium of Northern California (Ruth Greenblatt); Los Angeles County/Southern California Consortium (Alexandra Levine); Chicago Consortium (Mardge Cohen); Data Coordinating Center (Stephen Gange).\n\nThe WIHS is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (UO1-AI-35004, UO1-AI-31834, UO1-AI-34994, UO1-AI-34989, UO1-AI-34993, and UO1-AI-42590) and by the *Eunice Kennedy Shriver* National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (UO1-HD-32632).

We characterized relationships between genetic polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz concentrations in HIV-infected Black South African adults and children.\n\n### Methods\n\nSteady-state mid-dosing interval efavirenz concentrations were measured. We genotyped 241 polymorphisms in genes potentially relevant to efavirenz metabolism and transport, including *ABCB1*, *CYP2A6*, *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *CYP3A5*, *NR1I2* and *NR1I3*.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong 113 participants (59 adults and 54 children), minor allele frequencies for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15582C→T [rs4803419] were 0.36, 0.07, and 0.09, respectively. Based on composite *CYP2B6* 15582/516/983 genotype, there were 33 extensive metabolizer, 62 intermediate metabolizer and 18 slow metabolizer genotypes. Median (IQR) mid-dose efavirenz concentrations were 1.44 (1.21–1.93) µg ml^–1^, 2.08 (1.68–2.94) µg ml^–1^ and 7.26 (4.82–8.34) µg ml^–1^ for extensive, intermediate and slow metabolizers, respectively. In univariate analyses, a model that included composite genotype best predicted efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.28, 95% CI 0.21, 0.35, *P* = 2.4 × 10^–11^). Among individual *CYP2B6* polymorphisms, 516G→T best predicted efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.22, 95% CI 0.13, 0.30, *P* = 1.27 × 10^−6^). There was also associations with 983T→C (β = 0.27, 95% CI 0.10, 0.44, *P* = 0.002) and 15582C→T (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.22, *P* = 0.04). Associations were consistent in adults and children. No other polymorphisms were independently associated with efavirenz concentrations.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nComposite *CYP2B6* genotype based on *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15582C→T best described efavirenz exposure in HIV-infected Black South African adults and children.\n\n## What is Already Known about the Subject\n\n## What is Already Known about the Subject\n\n## What this Study Adds\n\n## What this Study Adds\n\n## Introduction\n\nEfavirenz is extensively prescribed for HIV-1 infection worldwide. It is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 [1](#b1). Analyses with AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocol 5097s first showed that the non-synonymous polymorphism *CYP2B6* 516G→T (rs3745274) was strongly associated with increased plasma efavirenz exposure [2](#b2). Many studies have since replicated this association [3](#b3)–[17](#b17). The *CYP2B6* 516G→T polymorphism is more frequent with African ancestry than with European ancestry [18](#b18), which largely explains the greater mean plasma efavirenz concentrations reported among populations of African descent [19](#b19),[20](#b20). A less frequent *CYP2B6* polymorphism, 983T→C (rs28399499), also predicts increased plasma efavirenz exposure [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21)–[25](#b25). The *CYP2B6* 983 C allele is found almost exclusively with African ancestry, where it is still much less frequent than 516G→T [18](#b18). A recent genome-wide association study of White, Black and Hispanic adults in the United States showed that a third polymorphism, *CYP2B6* 15582C→T (rs4803419), was also associated with estimated efavirenz trough concentrations independent of 516G→T and 983T→C [26](#b26).\n\nAdditional *CYP2B6* polymorphisms suggested to affect *CYP2B6* activity have been extremely infrequent [21](#b21),[27](#b27),[28](#b28), or have not predicted plasma efavirenz exposure [2](#b2),[29](#b29),[30](#b30). Polymorphisms in genes beyond *CYP2B6* reported to affect efavirenz pharmacokinetics include *CYP2A6* [7](#b7),[30](#b30), *CYP3A5* [2](#b2), *UGT2B7* [7](#b7) and *CAR* [31](#b31), *CYP3A5* [2](#b2), *UGT2B7* [7](#b7) and *CAR* [31](#b31), although results have been inconsistent. The genome-wide associations study noted above did not identify additional associations in or beyond *CYP2B6* [26](#b26).\n\nData from Africa have repeatedly replicated the association between efavirenz exposure and both *CYP2B6* 516G→T [7](#b7)–[17](#b17),[24](#b24),[25](#b25) and *CYP2B6* 983T→C [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21),[24](#b24),[25](#b25), but data from Africa beyond these two polymorphisms are limited. We characterized relationships between genetic polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz concentrations among HIV-infected adults and children in South Africa.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study Participants\n\nWe included adults and children who had been enrolled in two observational studies. In the adult study, adults from the public sector antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme were enrolled in a cross sectional study to evaluate associations between plasma efavirenz concentrations and metabolic complications. Eligible participants were on efavirenz-based therapy for at least 1 month, and were excluded for renal or hepatic disease, active opportunistic infections, known diabetes or dyslipidaemia, self-reported non-adherence, pregnancy, or concomitant drugs with the potential to interact with efavirenz.\n\nIn the paediatric study, African children (aged 3–15 years and weighing more than 10 kg) on efavirenz-based therapy with or without rifampicin-based anti-tuberculosis therapy were enrolled to evaluate the effect of rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy on efavirenz concentrations [32](#b32). The present analyses included only data from children who were not receiving rifampicin.\n\nAll participants self-identified as Black. This study complied with the Helsinki Declaration, was approved by institutional review boards for each site, and participants or their parents gave written informed consent or assent.\n\n### Characterization of Genetic Polymorphisms\n\nHuman DNA was extracted from buffy coats using the Wizard® Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A total of 241 polymorphisms (70 in *ABCB1* (also called *MDR1*), 22 in *CYP2A6*, 54 in *CYP2B6*, one in *CYP2C19*, 23 in *CYP3A4*, one in *CYP3A5*, 31 in *NR1I2* (also called *PXR*) and 39 in *NR1I3* (also called *CAR*)) were successfully genotyped in the Vanderbilt DNA Resources Core using MassARRAY® iPLEX Gold (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, California, USA). Our strategy for genotyping was as follows: For *CYP2B6*, *ABCB1* and *NR1I2* we tagged each entire gene using SeattleSNPs [33](#b33) using a cosmopolitan strategy across populations (Yoruba, Asian, African-American, European-American and Hispanic) with a 5% allelic frequency cut-off, a 0.80 threshold for *r*^2^, 85% data convergence for tagging polymorphisms and 70% data convergence for clustering. For *CYP2B6* we included 5 kB in each 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR), and for *ABCB1* and *NR1I2* 20 kB in each UTR. For *CYP2B6*, additional polymorphisms of interest (but that were not extremely infrequent) were added based on a previous report [3](#b3), as were polymorphisms with at least 5% allelic frequency in 20 kB of the 5’ UTR identified using Ensembl Genome Browser [34](#b34) and upstream polymorphisms possibly associated with CYP2B6 expression [35](#b35). We also included *ABCB1* 3435C→T (rs1045642) and 2677G/T/A (rs2032582), *CYP2C19* 681G→A (rs4244285) and *CYP3A5* 6986A→G (rs776746). (*CYP2C19* 681G→A was part of the already designed multiplex assay, but was not expected to affect efavirenz exposure). The final Sequenom assay design is available upon request. Laboratory personnel with no knowledge of clinical data performed genotyping. Ample duplicate and blank assays were included to assure validity. Polymorphisms were excluded for genotyping efficiency less than 95%.\n\nComposite *CYP2B6* 15582/516/983 genotypes were assigned as follows: extensive metabolizer genotype (15582CC-516GG-983TT or 15582CT-516GG-983TT), intermediate metabolizer genotype (15582TT-516GG-983TT, 15582CC-516GT-983TT, 15582CC-516GG-983CT, 15582CT-516GT-983TT or 15582CT-516GG-983CT) and slow metabolizer genotype (15582CC-516TT-983TT, 15582CC-516GT-983CT or 15582CC-516GG-983CC) [26](#b26).\n\n### Efavirenz Concentrations\n\nPlasma efavirenz concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MC/MS) as previously described [36](#b36). Intraday and interday precision ranged from 1.2 to 4.1% and 2.5 to 5.3%, respectively. The calibration range was linear from 0.1 to 15 µg ml^–1^ and accuracy ranged from 95.2 to 104.6%. Several samples were obtained on the same day from each participant. Sampling times were not pre-specified, and time of prior dose was by self-report for adults, and was reported by caregivers for children. We excluded efavirenz data from samples obtained less than 10 h or greater than 20 h post-dose, or before 1 month of efavirenz therapy, and from children within 1 month after discontinuing rifampicin. An average of measured concentrations was used when multiple samples from the same participant were obtained. The repeated measurements of efavirenz concentrations were used in exploratory multilevel mixed effects (MLME) analyses.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nThe pharmacokinetic data were not normally distributed. Therefore, a logarithmic (log_10_) transformation was done. Genetic associations with log_10_ transformed average efavirenz concentrations were analyzed by univariate linear regression. The tri-allelic *ABCB1* rs2032582 was analyzed as A *vs*. not A, G *vs*. not G and T *vs*. not T. We also performed analyses adjusting for *CYP2B6* 516G→T. All tests used a 5% two-sided significance level. Analyses were performed with PLINK version 1.07 ([http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/∼purcell/plink/](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/)). Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple testing [37](#b37). For polymorphisms previously associated with efavirenz pharmacokinetics, the threshold to carry forward into subsequent linear regression models was *P* = 0.01.\n\nHaplotypic blocks were defined using the D’ confidence intervals method in Haploview [38](#b38) and haplotype phases were inferred using the standard E-M algorithm in PLINK [39](#b39). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) plots and values were generated with Haploview ([www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/](http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/)).\n\nThe multilevel mixed effect regression model performed in Stata 11 [40](#b40), which accounted for within individual correlations, evaluated associations of efavirenz concentrations with the three polymorphisms adjusted for effects of time post-dose and age group.\n\n## Results\n\n### Study Participant Characteristics\n\nPharmacokinetic data were available from 152 participants, of whom 113 with sufficient DNA for successful genotyping are included in the present analyses. Among 59 adults, median age was 38 years (range 20 to 59 years), median weight was 65.9 kg (range 45.2 to 104.5 kg) and 45 (76%) were female. Of participants with available plasma HIV-1 RNA data, values were <400 copies ml^–1^ in 78% of adults and in 87% of children. Characteristics of study participants are presented in Table[1](#tbl1).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | Adults | n | Children | n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Efavirenz concentration (µg ml–1)* | 2.63 (0.67–29.53) | 59 | 1.90 (0.30–8.47) | 54 |\n| Time after dose (h)* | 12.3 (11.1–14.5) | 59 | 16.2 (14.0–17.8) | 54 |\n| Drug dose (mg day–1)* | 600 (600–600) | 59 | 300 (200–600) | 54 |\n| Age (years)* | 38.0 (20.0–59.0) | 59 | 8.2 (3.0–15.1) | 54 |\n| Weight (kg)* | 65.9 (45.2–104.5) | 59 | 22.3 (13.3–46.0) | 54 |\n| Female gender† | 45 (76.3) | 59 | 25 (46.3) | 54 |\n| CD4 T cell count (cells mm–3)* | 290 (74–904) | 59 | 533 (264–1522) | 16 |\n| HIV-1 RNA ≤ 400 copies ml–1† | 14 (77.8) | 18 | 13 (86.7) | 15 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Demographic and clinical characteristics of 113 study participants in South Africa.\n\n### Genetic Polymorphisms\n\nAmong the 113 participants, 241 polymorphisms were successfully genotyped, of which 18 were monomorphic (i.e. no minor alleles). Each of the remaining 223 polymorphisms was in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium based on a Bonferroni adjusted *P* value threshold of 0.0002; six had unadjusted *P* values <0.05 (*NR1I3* rs4489574, *P* = 0.002, *NR1I2* rs2461817, *P* = 0.021, *ABCB1* rs17149792, *P* = 0.024, *NR1I3* rs2502815, *P* = 0.026, *ABCB1* rs10264990, *P* = 0.035 and *CYP3A4* rs28539499, *P* = 0.036). Minor allele frequencies for the 241 polymorphisms are in Supplemental Material Table [S1](#sd1).\n\n### Genetic Associations with Efavirenz Concentrations\n\nThe median plasma mid-dose efavirenz concentration was 2.03 µg ml^–1^ (interquartile range 1.46–3.46 µg ml^–1^). In univariate linear regression models, composite *CYP2B6* 15582/516/983 genotype was most strongly associated with efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.28, 95% CI 0.21, 0.35, *P* = 2.4 × 10^–11^). Of the 223 polymorphisms, 15 (all in *CYP2B6*) were associated with efavirenz concentrations at *P* < 0.01. These include *CYP2B6* 516G→T (β = 0.22, 95% CI 0.13, 0.30, *P* = 1.3x10^–6^) and eight polymorphisms in LD with 516G→T at *r*^2^>0.6. The minor allele frequency of *CYP2B6* 516G→T was 0.36, with 43 (38.1%) homozygous for GG, 58 (51.3%) heterozygous for GT and 12 (10.6%) homozygous for TT. The minor allele frequency of *CYP2B6* 983T→C was 0.07, with 98 (86.7%) homozygous for TT, 15 (13.3%) heterozygous for TC and none homozygous for CC. The minor allele frequency of *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was 0.09, with 94 (83.2%) homozygous for CC, 18 (15.9%) heterozygous for TC and one (0.9%) homozygous for TT.\n\nTo identify independent predictors of efavirenz concentrations we performed multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T. By this analysis, the only additional polymorphism associated at *P* < 0.01 was *CYP2B6* 983T→C (β = 0.37, 95% CI 0.23, 0.52, *P* = 2.78 × 10^-6^). In an analysis that adjusted for both *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, no additional polymorphism was associated with efavirenz concentrations at *P* < 0.01, the lowest *P* value being for *CYP2B6* rs28723610 (β = 0.21, 95% CI 0.04, 0.38, *P* = 0.013). There was no apparent association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T (β = 0.06, 95% CI –0.06, 0.19, *P* = 0.34). Final multivariable linear regression models are presented in Table[2](#tbl2).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n|   |   | Unadjusted analysis |  | 516G→T adjusted |  | 516G→T and 983T→C adjusted |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chromosome | Polymorphism | β (95% CI) | P value | β (95% CI) | P value | β (95% CI) | P value |\n| 19 | CYP2B6 516G→T | 0.22 (0.13, 0.30) | 1.27 × 10–6 | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs8192719 | 0.22 (0.13, 0.30) | 1.27 × 10–6 | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs2279343 | 0.22 (0.13, 0.30) | 1.79 × 10–6 | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs10853744 | 0.21 (0.13, 0.29) | 2.33 × 10–6 | –0.13 (–0.70, 0.45) | 0.66 | –0.09 (–0.61, 0.43) | 0.74 |\n| 19 | rs11083595 | 0.18 (0.10, 0.26) | 2.30 × 10–5 | 0.002 (–0.17, 0.17) | 0.99 | 0.07 (–0.08, 0.23) | 0.37 |\n| 19 | rs2054675 | 0.18 (0.10, 0.26) | 2.30 × 10–5 | 0.002 (–0.17, 0.17) | 0.99 | 0.07 (–0.08, 0.23) | 0.37 |\n| 19 | rs3786547 | 0.18 (0.10, 0.27) | 2.39 × 10–5 | 0.0001 (–0.17, 0.17) | 1.00 | 0.07 (–0.09, 0.23) | 0.38 |\n| 19 | rs892216 | 0.18 (0.09, 0.26) | 6.71 × 10–5 | –0.006 (–0.16, 0.14) | 0.93 | 0.05 (–0.09, 0.19) | 0.49 |\n| 19 | rs7250873 | 0.16 (0.09, 0.25) | 1.07 × 10–4 | –0.004 (–0.21, 0.11) | 0.58 | 0.02 (–0.12, 0.17) | 0.74 |\n| 19 | CYP2B6 983T→C | 0.27 (0.10, 0.44) | 1.92 × 10–3 | 0.37 (0.22, 0.52) | 2.78 × 10-6 | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs1987236 | –0.16 (–0.26, –0.05) | 3.12 × 10–3 | –0.06 (–0.17, 0.04) | 0.25 | –0.02 (–0.12, 0.08) | 0.68 |\n| 19 | rs4803417 | –0.16 (–0.27, –0.05) | 5.14 × 10–3 | –0.06 (–0.18, 0.05) | 0.27 | –0.03 (–0.13, 0.07) | 0.58 |\n| 19 | rs2279345 | –0.14 (–0.24, –0.03) | 9.37 × 10–3 | –0.04 (–0.15, 0.06) | 0.39 | 0.004 (–0.09, 0.10) | 0.93 |\n| 19 | rs6508966 | –0.14 (–0.24, –0.03) | 9.37 × 10–3 | –0.04 (–0.15, 0.06) | 0.39 | 0.004 (–0.09, 0.10) | 0.93 |\n| 19 | rs6508965 | –0.14 (–0.27, –0.05) | 9.70 × 10–3 | –0.04 (–0.14, 0.06) | 0.43 | 0.01 (–0.08, 0.11) | 0.82 |\n| 19 | CYP2B6 15582C→T* | –0.06 (–0.21, 0.08) | 0.42 | 0.03 (–0.11, 0.17) | 0.67 | 0.06 (–0.06, 0.19) | 0.34 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Genetic associations with efavirenz concentrations in all 113 participants.\n\nIn the above analyses, two individuals had extreme outlier efavirenz values. One individual, a 41-year-old woman with a body mass index of 22 kg m^–2^, had three concentrations of 28.1, 28.2 and 32.3 µg ml^–1^ (mean 29.30 µg ml^–1^). She was homozygous for 15582CC, 516GG and 983TT. One individual, a 7-year-old boy weighing 21 kg at a height of 114 cm, had three concentrations of 0.32, 0.29 and 0.28 µg ml^–1^ (mean 0.30 µg ml^–1^). He was heterozygous for 15582CT and homozygous for 516GG and 983TT. To characterize associations with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T further, we performed *post hoc* sensitivity analyses after censoring the two outliers. In such analyses, adjusting for both 516G→T and 983T→C, five more *CYP2B6* polymorphisms in weak LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T showed trends toward association with low efavirenz concentrations in unadjusted analyses (Table[3](#tbl3)), and *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was now associated with efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.22, *P* = 0.04) (Table[3](#tbl3)). Relationships between genotypes and efavirenz concentrations in all individuals are presented in Figure[1A](#fig01).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   |   | Unadjusted analysis |  | 516G→T adjusted |  | 516G→T and 983T→C adjusted |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chromosome | Polymorphism | β (95% CI) | P value | β (95% CI) | P value | β (95% CI) | P value |\n| 19 | CYP2B6 516G→T | 0.23 (0.15, 0.30) | 3.83 × 10–8 | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs8192719 | 0.23 (0.15, 0.30) | 3.83 × 10–8 | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs2279343 | 0.22 (0.15, 0.30) | 4.33 × 10–8 | NA | NA | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs10853744 | 0.22 (0.14, 0.29) | 8.64 × 10–8 | –0.13 (–0.64, 0.38) | 0.63 | –0.08 (–0.53, 0.36) | 0.71 |\n| 19 | rs11083595 | 0.17 (0.09, 0.24) | 2.84 × 10–5 | –0.11 (–0.26, 0.04) | 0.17 | –0.04 (–0.18, 0.10) | 0.57 |\n| 19 | rs2054675 | 0.17 (0.09, 0.24) | 2.84 × 10–5 | –0.11 (–0.26, 0.04) | 0.17 | –0.04 (–0.18, 0.10) | 0.57 |\n| 19 | rs3786547 | 0.17 (0.09, 0.24) | 2.94 × 10–5 | –0.11 (–0.27, 0.04) | 0.16 | –0.04 (–0.18, 0.10) | 0.56 |\n| 19 | rs892216 | 0.16 (0.08, 0.24) | 9.04 × 10–5 | –0.09 (–0.22, 0.05) | 0.20 | –0.03 (–0.15, 0.09) | 0.58 |\n| 19 | rs7250873 | 0.15 (0.08, 0.23) | 1.47 × 10–4 | –0.14 (–0.29, 0.0008) | 0.05 | –0.08 (–0.20, 0.05) | 0.25 |\n| 19 | CYP2B6 983T→C | 0.28 (0.12, 0.43) | 6.10 × 10–4 | 0.38 (0.26, 0.51) | 3.13 × 10−8 | NA | NA |\n| 19 | rs6508950 | –0.14 (–0.23, –0.06) | 1.28 × 10–3 | –0.10 (–0.17, –0.02) | 0.02 | –0.05 (–0.12, 0.02) | 0.14 |\n| 19 | rs1987236 | –0.15 (–0.25, –0.06) | 1.35 × 10–3 | –0.05 (–0.14, 0.04) | 0.28 | –0.004 (–0.09, 0.08) | 0.93 |\n| 19 | rs4803417 | –0.16 (–0.26, –0.06) | 2.43 × 10–3 | –0.05 (–0.15, 0.05) | 0.30 | –0.01 (–0.10, 0.08) | 076 |\n| 19 | rs10422346 | –0.16 (–0.26, –0.05) | 3.58 × 10–3 | –0.06 (–0.16, 0.04) | 0.27 | –0.03 (–0.13, 0.07) | 0.58 |\n| 19 | rs2279345 | –0.13 (–0.23, –0.04) | 4.98 × 10–3 | –0.03 (–0.13, 0.06) | 0.46 | 0.02 (–0.06, 0.10) | 0.60 |\n| 19 | rs6508966 | –0.13 (–0.23, –0.04) | 4.98 × 10–3 | –0.03 (–0.13, 0.06) | 0.46 | 0.02 (–0.06, 0.10) | 0.60 |\n| 19 | rs6508965 | –0.13 (–0.23, –0.04) | 5.20 × 10–3 | –0.03 (–0.12, 0.06) | 0.53 | 0.03 (–0.05, 0.11) | 0.47 |\n| 19 | rs7259758 | –0.14 (–0.25, –0.04) | 5.47 × 10–3 | –0.06 (–0.16, 0.04) | 0.25 | –0.02 (–0.11, 0.06) | 0.64 |\n| 19 | rs1962261 | –0.15 (–0.26, –0.04) | 6.27 × 10–3 | –0.06 (–0.16, 0.04) | 0.23 | –0.02 (–0.12, 0.02) | 0.60 |\n| 19 | rs11671243 | –0.12 (–0.22, –0.03) | 9.16 × 10–3 | –0.02 (–0.11, 0.07) | 0.68 | 0.02 (–0.06, 0.10) | 0.55 |\n| 19 | CYP2B6 15582C→T* | –0.01 (–0.15, 0.13) | 0.87 | 0.08 (–0.04, 0.21) | 0.18 | 0.12 (0.01, 0.22) | 0.04 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Genetic associations with log10-transformed efavirenz concentrations in all 111 participants, and excluding two outliers.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3b36/4500334/a2784d5da572/bcp0080-0146-f1.jpg)\n\nRelationships between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and log10 transformed efavirenz concentrations in adults and children. Efavirenz concentrations were determined as described in Methods. Relationships with CYP2B6 polymorphisms and log10 efavirenz concentrations are shown in all participants (A), adults (B) and children (C). On the x-axis, CYP2B6 haplotypes represent (in order) CYP2B6 15582C→T (CC, CT, TT), 516G→T (GG, GT, TT) and 983T→C (TT, TC). Number per CYP2B6 haplotype is also displayed. On the y-axis, the log10 transformed efavirenz concentrations are displayed. On each graph, each marker represents a different participant. Horizontal bars are medians and interquartile ranges. Median values are above\n\nIn the final multivariable model, each 516 T allele was associated with a 31% increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.27, *P*<0.0001), each 983 C allele with a 46% increase (β = 0.38, *P*<0.0001), and each 15582 T allele with a 6% increase (β = 0.06, *P* = 0.340). These three polymorphisms explained 34% of variance in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations. A model that included only *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C also explained 34% of variance in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations. Univariate linear regression models for each individual polymorphism explained 19%, 8% and only 0.59% of variance for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T, respectively.\n\nIn the *post hoc* sensitivity analysis that censored the two outlier participants, each 516 T allele was associated with a 33% increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.29, *P* < 0.0001), each 983 C allele with a 48% increase (β = 0.39, *P* < 0.0001) and each 15582 T allele with a 12% increase (β = 0.12, *P* = 0.04), which together explained 45% of variance. A model that included only *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C explained 43% of variance. Univariate linear regression models for each individual polymorphism explained 24%, 10% and only 0.02% of variance for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T, respectively.\n\nWe also performed separate analyses among children and adults. Linear regression results for children and adults are shown in Supplemental Material Table [S2](#sd2) and S3, respectively. In both analyses, *CYP2B6* 516G→T (and polymorphisms in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T) and 983T→C were strongly associated with log_10_ efavirenz concentrations. In unadjusted analyses, there was no association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T. In adults, unadjusted analyses revealed that *NR1I2* rs9847782 had the greatest effect size (β = 0.37, 95% CI 0.11, 0.62, *P* = 7.3 × 10^−3^), which was no longer apparent when one outlier was excluded (a 41-year-old with very high efavirenz concentrations and homozygous for *NR1I2* rs9847782TT). Interestingly, in children only, when the outlier with an exceptionally low log_10_ efavirenz concentration was excluded (a 7-year-old heterozygous for *CYP2B6* 15582 CT), *CYP2B6* 15582C→T showed a trend towards significance when adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C (β = 0.08, 95% CI 0.005, 0.30, *P* = 0.05). Relationships between genotypes and efavirenz concentrations in children and adults are presented in Figure[1B](#fig01) and Figure[1C](#fig01), respectively.\n\nAs there were clinical differences (including age and sampling time post-dose) between adults and children in our analyses, we explored multilevel mixed effects modelling using each measured efavirenz value separately in each participant, rather than the mean of concentration values. We fitted a hierarchical model that predicted log_10_ efavirenz concentrations as a function of 1) fixed effects of age group, time after dose, *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T and 2) random effects for the individual to account for within individual correlations. In this model, compared with individuals in the lowest concentration stratum (i.e. 15582CC-516GG-983TT, β = 0.58), when time after dose and age group were held constant, homozygosity for *CYP2B6* 516TT was associated with an 0.64 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (2.9-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations), heterozygosity for *CYP2B6* 983TC with an 0.36 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (2.1-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations), heterozygosity for *CYP2B6* 516GT with an 0.19 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (1.5-fold increase in measured concentrations), homozygosity for *CYP2B6* 15582TT with an 0.21 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (1.4-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations) and heterozygosity for *CYP2B6* 15582CT with an 0.06 increase in log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (1.2-fold increase in measured efavirenz concentrations).\n\n### Linkage Disequilibrium Between CYP2B6 Polymorphisms\n\nTo understand relationships between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms associated with efavirenz concentrations better, we considered LD. In the first model, without adjusting for any polymorphisms, two groups of polymorphisms were associated with efavirenz concentrations (Table[2](#tbl2)), the first comprising eight polymorphisms in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T and with minor alleles associated with higher efavirenz concentrations (i.e. positive β values), and the second comprising five polymorphisms in weaker LD with *CYP2B6* 516G→T and with minor alleles trending towards an association with lower efavirenz concentrations (i.e. negative β values). In the second analyses, which adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T, none of the above 13 polymorphisms remained associated with efavirenz concentrations, with only *CYP2B6* 983T→C becoming significant, with a greater effect size and even lower *P* value (Table[2](#tbl2)). No polymorphisms were in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 983T→C. In the third analyses, which adjusted for *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, no other polymorphisms were associated with efavirenz concentrations (Table[2](#tbl2)). Linkage disequilibrium between the *CYP2B6* polymorphisms is shown in Figure[2](#fig02). We only show polymorphisms with *P* values < 0.01 on unadjusted analyses, as well as *CYP2B6* 15582C→T and *CYP2B6* -2320T→C (rs7251950) polymorphisms. The latter was included because it was reported to be in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T in other populations [26](#b26). In our cohort, it was in weak LD with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T (*r*^2^ =0.19).\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3b36/4500334/6eb47e3b0463/bcp0080-0146-f2.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4500334_bcp0080-0146-f2.jpg)\n\nLinkage disequilibrium plot between polymorphisms in the CYP2B6 locus created in Haploview.

Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed no associations beyond *CYP2B6* and the results are shown in Supplemental Material Table S4. The minor allele frequencies are also displayed. The *CYP2A6* rs1801272 was monomorphic in our cohort. With only 18 participants with *CYP2B6* slow metabolizer genotypes, we were unable to replicate a previously reported association with *CYP2A6* -48T→G (rs28399433) in this group (*P* = 0.89).\n\n## Discussion\n\nEfavirenz is one of the most extensively prescribed medications worldwide for HIV-1 infection, and multiple previous studies have associated *CYP2B6* 516 G→T [2](#b2)–[13](#b13) and *CYP2B6* 983 T→C [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21)–[25](#b25), with increased plasma efavirenz concentrations. Our study replicated these associations in Black South Africans. In addition, we showed for the first time that *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was associated with plasma efavirenz concentrations in Black South Africans, which had previously only been reported for efavirenz in one study from the United States [26](#b26). In univariate analyses, a model that included composite genotype best predicted efavirenz concentrations. These associations were consistent in adults and children. An association between *CYP2B6* 15582C→T and slower plasma drug clearance has also been reported among Cambodians for the CYP2B6 substrate nevirapine [44](#b44), further supporting the validity of our finding. We did not find significant associations beyond *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582C→T. Although one analysis suggested an association with *NR1I2* rs9847782, this was no longer apparent after excluding one outlier, suggesting a spurious association. Our study also provided information regarding minor allele frequencies for *ABCB1*, *CYP2A6*, *CYP2B6*, *CYP3A4*, *NR1I2* and *NR1I3* polymorphisms in a South African population.\n\nWe observed somewhat lower efavirenz concentrations in children, which is probably explained by the higher clearance in children compared with adults relative to their size [45](#b45). Although WHO weight-based dosing in children is intended to achieve efavirenz concentrations similar to those in adults with fixed dosing, high prevalence of low efavirenz concentrations in children has been observed in a South African population similar to ours, and has been attributed to the current weight based WHO guidelines [46](#b46). We assessed associations between polymorphisms and efavirenz concentrations separately in adults and children. In both children and adults, *CYP2B6* 516G→T had the strongest overall association with efavirenz concentrations, although *CYP2B6* 983T→C had the greatest effect size per allele. The association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T could not be demonstrated in adults and children analyzed separately, possibly due to smaller samples sizes.\n\nIn the present analysis, minor allele frequencies of *CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C, and 15882C→T were 0.36, 0.07 and 0.09, respectively. In the multivariate regression model including all three polymorphisms, *CYP2B6* 983T→C had the greatest magnitude of effect on log_10_ efavirenz concentrations (β = 0.38 for 983T→C, β = 0.27 for 516G→T, β = 0.06 for 15882C→T), but due to lower frequency only explained approximately 8% of variance in univariate analysis *vs*. 19% for 516G→T, and negligible effect for 15882C→T. In sensitivity analyses that excluded two individuals with extreme outlier efavirenz concentrations, the variance explained by all three polymorphisms increased from 34% to 45%.\n\nOur analyses included two participants with extreme outlier efavirenz concentrations, and in neither of the cases could we identify an explanation. Dose-to-sampling times were reported to be within the 10–20 h mid-dose interval window and there were multiple efavirenz determinations from each participant. However, non-adherence in the participant with the lowest concentrations cannot be excluded. Sensitivity analyses that excluded these two participants allowed a significant association between *CYP2B6* 15882C→T and log_10_ efavirenz concentrations to be demonstrated. This same approach to censor outliers was used by Bertrand *et al*. [44](#b44) and highlights the critical importance of minimizing phenotype misclassification for detecting true associations.\n\nOur primary analyses considered genetic associations with log_10_-transformed efavirenz concentrations. Where data from multiple samples were available from the same individual, the time adjusted average was used. We also employed the hierarchical model to consider repeated measurements taking into account variation on fixed (*CYP2B6* 516G→T, 983T→C and 15582 C→T genotypes, age group, time after dose) and random (individual) effects. The advantage of this analysis is that it provides more information about the contribution of genotype to the increase in efavirenz concentrations when all other parameters are equal.\n\nPrevious studies from Africa have replicated the association between *CYP2B6* 516G→T and plasma efavirenz exposure, including studies of patients from Zimbabwe [8](#b8),[9](#b9),[13](#b13), South Africa [10](#b10),[11](#b11),[17](#b17),[25](#b25), Ghana [7](#b7),[24](#b24), Uganda [12](#b12),[13](#b13), Tanzania [14](#b14),[15](#b15), Rwanda [16](#b16) and Ethiopia [14](#b14). Multiple studies of patients from Africa have also shown the association with 983T→C [9](#b9),[13](#b13),[16](#b16),[21](#b21),[24](#b24),[25](#b25). Data for association beyond *CYP2B6* are limited. A study of patients in Ghana found associations with *CYP2A6* and *UGT2B7* polymorphisms [7](#b7), but a subsequent study of patients in Ghana did not replicate independent associations with these polymorphisms [24](#b24).\n\nThe association between *CYP2B6* 15582C→T and plasma efavirenz concentrations was first discovered and replicated in a genome-wide association study from the United States [26](#b26). This polymorphism was also associated with increased plasma efavirenz concentrations in Cambodians receiving concomitant antituberculosis therapy with isoniazid and rifampicin [47](#b47). In Cambodians receiving nevirapine, *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was also associated with decreased plasma nevirapine clearance, as was *CYP2B6* -2320T→C (rs7251950), which was in strong LD with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T in that study [44](#b44). In contrast, in the present study *CYP2B6* -2320T→C was in weak LD with 15582C→T (r^2^ = 0.19) and was not associated with efavirenz concentrations. In addition, Lamba *et al.* reported that *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was associated with lower hepatic CYP2B6 expression in females [48](#b48). In the present study, while the association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T was only significant in analyses that included both adults and children and with outliers excluded (to provide a cleaner phenotype), this association was highly likely to be valid considering the above reports in non-African populations. Additional studies on other populations will help to replicate and refine this association further.\n\nThis study increases our understanding of efavirenz pharmacogenetics and has potential clinical implications. Because many patients (especially those with intermediate and slow metabolizer *CYP2B6* genotypes) have plasma efavirenz exposure in considerable excess of what is needed to control HIV-1 replication, there has been interest in alternative dosing strategies for efavirenz. The ENCORE1 study evaluated routinely initiating a lower dose of efavirenz (400 mg rather than 600 mg) in adults without genetic testing, and showed somewhat improved tolerability and no apparent loss of antiviral efficacy [49](#b49). If that approach is to be translated into clinical practice, the present study suggests that the group at greatest risk for subtherapeutic efavirenz concentrations will be patients who lack polymorphisms at all three loci (i.e. *CYP2B6* 516GG-983TT-15582CC). Only by genotyping for all three polymorphism can this group be defined. Consideration has also been given to using genetic testing to individualize better efavirenz dosing. This may be most practical in paediatrics, where individualized weight-based dosing is already used. In this setting, testing for polymorphisms at all three loci will allow the most precise dosing.\n\nThe present study considered combined analyses involving both adults and children, as well as subgroup analyses involving adults and children separately. A potential concern with combined analyses is the different approach to dosing efavirenz, with adults receiving a uniform dose and children receiving a weight-based dose, which might offset the advantage of a larger sample size. Several considerations provided reassurance that combined analyses were not problematic, and improved our likelihood of finding true associations. First, associations with the known loss-of-function polymorphisms, *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, were far more significant in combined analyses than in subgroup analyses, suggesting that our ability to detect true associations was increased, not decreased, by combining groups. Second, the association with *CYP2B6* 15582C→T only achieved significance in combined analyses. Third, the rationale for a weight-based dose in children was to approximate plasma exposure in adults, which reduces concern about combining groups.\n\nThere were limitations to the present study. Sample size limited our power to identify novel genetic associations for polymorphisms that were infrequent or had small effects, even with the dataset that included both adults and children. For example, assuming a standard deviation of 0.33 for log_10_ efavirenz concentration within each genotype group and a type II error of 0.2, we have 80% power for the following differences in pair-wise means homozygotes and heterozygotes: with 59 subjects and MAF = 0.1 a difference of 0.24 log_10_ (∼75% absolute), with 59 subjects and MAF = 0.3 a difference 0.19 log_10_ (∼55% absolute), with 113 subjects and MAF = 0.1 a difference of 0.17 log_10_ (∼50% absolute), with 113 subjects and MAF = 0.3 a difference of 0.14 log_10_ (∼40% absolute). Small sample size also limited our ability to test for interactions between *CYP2B6* genotype and age in children, although we did not anticipate such interactions. Because the dose of efavirenz was not observed, we could not be certain of dose sampling times.\n\nIn summary, the present study improves the understanding of genetic determinants of efavirenz plasma exposure in an African population, including adults and children. Studies of associations between efavirenz concentrations and polymorphisms in African populations should consider *CYP2B6* 516G→T and 983T→C, and ideally also 15582C→T.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nPZS participated in the study design, DNA extraction, genotyping, acquisition of data, data analysis and interpretation and drafted the manuscript.

In the context of personalized medicine, the aims of this study were to evaluate whether cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 (*CHRNA2)*, cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 3 *(CHRNA3)*, cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 5 (*CHRNA5)* and cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 3 (*CHRNB3)* polymorphisms were associated with nicotine dependence severity, and to investigate possible pharmacogenetics markers of smoking cessation treatment.\n\n### Methods\n\nThis study cohort enrolled 1049 smoking patients who received pharmacological treatment (varenicline, varenicline plus bupropion, bupropion plus/or nicotine replacement therapy). Smoking cessation success was considered for patients who completed 6 months of continuous abstinence. Fagerström test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and Issa situational smoking scores (Issa score) were analyzed for nicotine dependence. *CHRNA2* (rs2472553), *CHRNA3* (rs1051730), *CHRNA5* (rs16969968 and rs2036527) and *CHRNB3* (rs6474413) polymorphisms were genotyped by high resolution melting analysis.\n\n### Results\n\nFemales with GA and AA genotypes for *CHRNA5* rs16969968 and rs2036527 polymorphisms had higher success rate in smoking cessation treatment: 44.0% and 56.3% (rs16969968), 41.5% and 56.5% (rs2036527), respectively, compared with carriers of the GG genotypes: 35.7% (rs16969968), 34.8% (rs2036527), (*P* = 0.03, *n* = 389; *P* = 0.01, *n* = 391). The GA or AA genotypes for the rs16969968 and rs2036527 were associated with higher odds ratio for success in women (OR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.54; *P* = 0.03 and OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.48; *P* = 0.04; respectively). We did not find association of these polymorphisms with nicotine dependence related scores. Polymorphisms in the *CHRNA2*, *CHRNA3* and *CHRNB3* genes were not associated with the phenotypes studied.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*CHRNA5* rs16969968 and rs2036527 were associated with higher success rate in the smoking cessation treatment in women. These findings might contribute to advances in personalized medicine.\n\n### Electronic supplementary material\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12881-018-0571-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n## Background\n\nSmoking is a serious public health problem, contributing significantly to the risk of death from cancers, cardiovascular diseases, lung disorders and stroke. Public health agencies aim to reduce tobacco use; however, relapse is common during smoking treatment programs. According to the World Health Organization, if current trends continue, the annual number of deaths from diseases related to smoking could double from five million in 2000 to 10 million in 2020 [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)].\n\nStudies have shown that although smoke toxicity is related to many components of the cigarette, nicotine is responsible for the development of dependence [[3](#CR3), [4](#CR4)]. Smokers in Brazil who want to quit have the following first-line pharmacological treatments: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion (an inhibitor of the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine and nicotinic antagonist) and, varenicline (a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor - nAChR - α4β2) [[5](#CR5)–[7](#CR7)].\n\nCigarette smoking is classified as a complex behavior comprising multiple stages such as initiation, experimentation, regular use, addiction, cessation and relapse [[8](#CR8), [9](#CR9)]. To better understand the role played by genes in those stages, twin studies, and allelic association studies of candidate genes and large genome wide-association studies are increasingly required [[8](#CR8)–[10](#CR10)].\n\nIn the last ten years, several studies have identified *loci*, mainly in chromosome 8 and 15, which are highly involved in the pathogenesis of nicotine dependence (ND) process. These regions of the genome include genes encoding various subunits of the nAChR. These receptors are expressed in the brain and are thought to be responsible for mediating the addictive effects of nicotine [[1](#CR1), [8](#CR8), [10](#CR10)–[14](#CR14)]. Therefore, studies have shown the association of polymorphisms in genes encoding the subunits of nicotinic receptors (*CHRNA2*, *CHRNA3*, *CHRNA5*, *CHRNB3*) with the number of cigarettes per day, ND and risk for developing lung cancer [[1](#CR1), [8](#CR8), [13](#CR13), [15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)].\n\nIn the context of personalized medicine, the aims of the present study were to evaluate whether *CHRNA2, CHRNA3, CHRNA5* and, *CHRNB3* polymorphisms were associated with level of dependency and, response to smoking cessation therapies in patients from a smoking cessation assistance program.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study population\n\nThe study sample included 1049 smoking patients from PAF (Programa de Assistência ao Fumante /Smoker Assistance Program), Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil, between January, 2007 and November, 2014. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (Comissão de Ética para Análises de Projetos de Pesquisa - CAPPesq − 4024/14/004), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to entering the study. Data from patients who had outcome in smoking treatment were obtained from the PAF database.\n\nThe PAF protocol consists of an initial medical visit plus an average of 4 follow-up medical visits for 12 weeks. The follow-up was made by phone in patients who did not continue to come on scheduled medical visits. Clinical data and end-expiratory exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) were collected in all visits. Data about demographic, socio-economic, clinical data and previously diagnosed diseases were acquired at the consult. During clinical anamnesis patients were questioned whether they were undergoing treatment or had a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Patients received behavioral counseling and drug treatment from physicians specialized in smoking cessation. Bupropion plus/or NRT was prescribed for patients who smoked less than 1 cigarette pack per day. Varenicline was prescribed for patients who smoked 1 or more cigarette pack(s) per day, or who failed in previous attempts with bupropion plus/or NRT. The decision to start co-administration of bupropion and varenicline was made if the patient was unable to quit smoking after 2 or 3 months of starting varenicline use, or if the patient stopped smoking, but presented moderate or intense discomfort abstinence symptoms. Continuous abstinence (CA) was investigated after 6 months of starting pharmacotherapy. Smoking status (outcome) was divided into: success group (patients who completed 6 months of CA confirmed by end-expiratory exhaled carbon monoxide < 4 ppm), relapse group (patients who did not complete 6 months of CA), and resistant group (patients who never achieved CA after starting drug treatment) [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)].\n\n### FTND and Issa scores\n\nThe Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and the Issa Situational Smoking Score (Issa score) were used to assess smoking behavior. The FTND is comprised of six questions with different weights for each question, generating a score ranging from 0 to 10 points and individuals are grouped into five categories: 1–2 points = very low dependence; 3–4 points = low dependence; 5 points = medium dependence; 6–7 points = high dependence; and 8–10 points = very high dependence [[19](#CR19)]. The Issa score is comprised of four questions, one point for each affirmative answer, generating a scores ranging from 0 to 4 points. Individuals are grouped into categories: 1 point = low dependence; 2–3 points = medium dependence; 4 points = high dependence [[20](#CR20)].\n\nThe FTND is a revised version of the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) and it is based in the cigarette consumption, while the Issa score is based on the psychoactive effects of nicotine on cognitive processes, attention, concentration, mood, well-being and pleasure [[20](#CR20)]. The Issa score is used at the PAF to reclassify nicotine dependent patients who achieved a FTND score below 5 but have otherwise considerable ND level in relation to the psychoactive effects of nicotine. As consequences of the psychoactive action of nicotine, smokers can have behaviors that may indicate the intensity of addiction [[20](#CR20)].\n\n### Genotyping\n\nThe criteria for selection of these polymorphisms was the number of significant replications in genetic association studies.\n\nGenomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from subjects was extracted from peripheral blood following a standard salting-out procedure. Genotyping for the *CHRNA2* rs2472553 (c.674C > T), *CHRNA3* rs1051730 (c.645C > T), *CHRNA5* rs16969968 (c.1192G > A), *CHRNA5* rs2036527 (g.78559273G > A) and *CHRNB3* rs6474413 (g.42695921G > A) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis according with previous studies [[21](#CR21), [22](#CR22)]. Amplification of the fragment for the *CHRNA2* rs2472553, *CHRNA3* rs1051730, *CHRNA5* rs16969968, *CHRNA5* rs2036527 and *CHRNB3* rs6474413 were performed using the primers shown in Additional file [1](#MOESM1): Table S1. As an example, Additional fil [2](#MOESM2): Figure S1 shows normalized fluorescence by temperature graphs for the *CHRNA5* rs16969968 polymorphism. Nine percent of the samples were randomly selected and reanalyzed as quality controls and gave identical results.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nContinuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation and categorical variables as frequencies. Chi-square test was performed for the comparative analysis of treatment outcome in the overall group of patients and groups of women and men according to the polymorphisms in *CHRNA2, CHRNA3, CHRNA5* and *CHRNB3* genes. The analysis of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was also performed using the chi-square test. The Student’s t-test was used to compare values of the FTND score according to polymorphisms and also, to compare general and clinical characteristics between men and women. Linear regression models were conducted to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in FTND in the presence of covariates: age, gender (male), race/self-declared color (white) and educational status. Logistic regression multivariate models were used to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) for success (versus relapse plus resistant) according to the polymorphisms. Covariates used in the models were: age, race/self-declared color (white), FTND score and drug group. Studies have tested additive effects, including some of the largest genetic studies on smoking behavior [[23](#CR23)] and cessation [[24](#CR24)]. However, the dominant model was chosen based on previous studies: *CHRNA2* rs2472553 (CC vs CT + TT) [[13](#CR13)], *CHRNA3* rs1051730 (CC vs CT + TT) [[25](#CR25)], *CHRNA5* rs16969968 (GG vs GA + AA) [[26](#CR26)], *CHRNA5* rs2036527 (GG vs GA + AA) [[27](#CR27)] and *CHRNB3* rs6474413 (GG vs GA + AA) [[28](#CR28)]. Statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software (v.16.0), with the level of significance set at *p* ≤ 0.05.\n\n## Results\n\n### General, clinical, and genetic characteristics of patients\n\nThe clinical and demographic characteristics of the 1049 participants are shown in Table [1](#Tab1). Patients in the analysis had a mean age of 54.0 ± 15.0 years and 54.7% were female. Race/color self-declared white was 65.8%. The non-white was composed by patients self-declared as blacks (7.2%) and intermediates (23.9%). In addition, Asians (3.0%) and Amerindians (0.1%) were enrolled. The minor allele frequencies and genotypic distributions for the rs2472553, rs1051730, rs16969968, rs2036527 and rs6474413 were in accordance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (Additional file [1](#MOESM1) Table S2).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | Women (n = 574) | Men (n = 475) | P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (years) | 54 ± 18 | 54 ± 11 | 0.52 |\n| Race/color self-declared, White (%) | 62.2 | 69.3 | 0.08 |\n| Body mass index (Kg/m2) | 27 ± 6 | 27 ± 5 | 0.17 |\n| Educational status, college (%) | 28.4 | 32.4 | 0.44 |\n| Hypertension (%) | 45.1 | 53.7 | 0.006 |\n| Coronary artery disease (%) | 14.1 | 26.9 | < 0.001 |\n| Acute myocardial infarction (%) | 14.5 | 31.2 | < 0.001 |\n| Dyslipidemia (%) | 40.6 | 46.1 | 0.07 |\n| Diabetes mellitus type 2 (%) | 14.3 | 17.5 | 0.16 |\n| Depression (%) | 24.7 | 13.7 | < 0.001 |\n| Anxiety (%) | 21.6 | 15.8 | 0.02 |\n| Obstructive pulmonar chronic disease (%) | 16.9 | 15.4 | 0.50 |\n| Asthma (%) | 1.6 | 1.1 | 0.47 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Clinical and demographic characteristics of patients undergoing smoking cessation (n = 1049)\n\n### Success rate in smoking cessation according to genotypes\n\nTable [2](#Tab2) shows the success rate in smoking cessation for patients according to the genotypes for *CHRNA2* rs2472553, *CHRNA3* rs1051730, *CHRNA5* rs16969968 and rs2036527 and *CHRNB3* rs6474413 polymorphisms. The GA and AA genotypes for the *CHRNA5* rs2036527 and rs16969968 polymorphisms were associated with higher rates of success in smoking cessation treatment in the female group (*n* = 389, *n* = 391); (*P* = 0.03, *P* = 0.01), respectively. The frequencies of success according to genotypes among the drug treatment groups were not different.

Given these differences, the variables depression and/or anxiety were tested in logistic regression. These variables were not associated with treatment success in this model. However, GA and AA genotypes for rs2036527 and rs16969968 polymorphisms remained significantly associated.\n\n### FTND score according to CHRNA2, CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNB3 polymorphisms\n\nWe did not observe significant differences in the FTND score according to *CHRNA2* rs2472553, *CHRNA3* rs1051730, *CHRNA5* rs16969968, *CHRNA5* rs2036527 and *CHRNB3* rs6474413 polymorphisms in the overall patient group (*n* = 899) (Additional file [1](#MOESM1): Table S3). In addition, studied polymorphisms were not associated with FTND score in multiple linear regression models (Additional file [1](#MOESM1): Table S4).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe main findings of this study was the association of GA and AA genotypes for both *CHRNA5* rs16969968 and rs2036527 polymorphisms with increased success rate in smoking cessation treatment in women. Many studies have identified the association of polymorphisms in the *CHRNA5-A3-B4* gene with smoking cessation in response to smoking cessation therapies [[2](#CR2), [29](#CR29)–[31](#CR31)]. Recently, our group of researchers found the association of the *CHRNA4* rs10443196 and cytochrome P450 2B6 (*CYP2B6)* 785A > G polymorphisms with a higher success rate in varenicline and bupropion treatment, respectively [[32](#CR32), [33](#CR33)].\n\nThe association of the *CHRNA5* rs16969968 polymorphism with higher rates of success in smoking cessation treatment in women is corroborated by previous studies. As shown in vitro experiments Bierut et al. [[14](#CR14)] and Kuryatov et al. [[34](#CR34)], individuals carrying the allele A may express nAChR subtypes composed by α5 subunits with reduced function. Bergen et al. [[35](#CR35)] showed that a lower frequency of the allele for rs1051730, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs16969968, was associated with a higher withdrawal rate with NRT. Bergen et al. pointed out that smokers with reduced function of the α5 subunit and associated with increased ND may have greater difficulty quitting. However, they suggested that the prescription of NRT can improve cognitive performance in smoking abstinence, maintaining the normal functioning of the brain after quitting, and this effect may be stronger for individuals with the rs1051730 risk allele. Similarly, Chen et al. [[36](#CR36)] reported that individuals with the AA genotype for the rs16969968 had higher withdrawal rate in the treatment with NRT. In the study by Jensen et al. [[37](#CR37)], the A allele was associated with lower rates of aversive effects to the nicotine and also with improvement in cognitive control. Jensen et al. suggested that the A allele may be important in tolerability and in response to treatments with NRT. They added that, remarkably, the α5 subunit plays an essential role in mediating aversive effects to the nicotine. Interestingly, King et al. [[31](#CR31)] showed the association of others risk alleles for ND in *locus* chr15q25 with lower incidence of nausea. The authors suggest that this may be explained by the tolerance, because individuals with higher ND have higher daily intake of nicotine, are more tolerant and therefore are less likely to experience nausea in response to a nicotinic partial agonist such as varenicline. Therefore, reduced function of the α5 subunit, the higher tolerability of NRT and varenicline and improvement of cognitive control may be possible explanations for the association of rs16969968 with success in this study. One other possibility is that the rs16969968 can be in linkage disequilibrium with other functional polymorphisms that could be involved in smoking cessation process and/or mechanisms in response to the NRT.\n\nThere was a higher frequency of depression and/or anxiety in the women’s group, which according to some studies could reduce success rates in the smoking cessation treatment [[38](#CR38)–[42](#CR42)]. Zawertailo et al. [[38](#CR38)] conducted a study of 13,000 smokers and found that individuals with recurrent depression were significantly less likely to quit smoking compared to those with no history of depression. Goodwin et al. [[39](#CR39)] found that panic attacks and social anxiety disorder were more likely in female smokers than male smokers. Stepankova et al. [[40](#CR40)], in a study of 1730 smokers, found that 289 had a history of depression. The tobacco abstinence rate at 1 year was 32.5% for smokers with a history of depression and 38.7% for those with no history. In our study, although the frequencies of depression and anxiety were higher in women than in men, these variables were not associated with treatment outcome and rs16969968 and rs2036527 polymorphisms remained significantly associated with smoking cessation in a multivariate model.\n\nThere are evidences that gender can be an important factor in smoking cessation process. Beltz et al. [[43](#CR43)], evaluating functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral data from 50 adult daily smokers (23 women), found that women had an increased nicotine tolerance when compared to men. Smith et al. [[44](#CR44)] found that women were 31% less likely to quit smoking than men. Pierce et al. [[45](#CR45)] reported significant sex differences in smoking cessation. They observed the women had weight gain, higher prevalence of depression disorders and increased need of social support to stop smoking.\n\nSome studies showed that several factors may influence sex/gender differences [[46](#CR46)], such as biopsychosocial factors, menstrual cycle, hormonal [[47](#CR47), [48](#CR48)], having children or not, and smoking cessation medication [[44](#CR44), [49](#CR49)].\n\nIn the present study, we found no association of *CHRNA2* rs2472553, *CHRNA3* rs1051730 and *CHRNB3* rs6474413 polymorphisms with treatment outcome. The results of our study corroborate the findings of previous studies. Ruyck et al. [[50](#CR50)] and Sarginson et al. [[2](#CR2)] found no association for rs1051730 with outcome of treatment. However, Munafo et al. [[51](#CR51)] identified the T allele associated with decreased likelihood of smoking cessation. Bergen et al. [[35](#CR35)] associated the T allele with higher withdrawal rates with NRT and lower withdrawal rate in placebo treatment.\n\nRegarding FTND score, several studies have identified the association of polymorphisms in genes encoding nAChR alpha and beta subunits with FTND and, number of cigarettes per day [[52](#CR52)–[57](#CR57)]. However, our study found no significant association of the polymorphisms studied with FTND, consistent with the findings of previous studies, which found no association of *CHRNA3* rs1051730, *CHRNA5* rs16969968, *CHRNA5* rs2036527 or *CHRNA5* rs6474413 polymorphisms with phenotypes related to smoking, including ND [[58](#CR58)–[62](#CR62)].\n\nEtter et al. [[62](#CR62)] suggested that the reason for missing association of polymorphisms studied, including rs16969968, can be explained by the difference in the methods used, or due to the small sample size. Amos et al. [[61](#CR61)] did not find association of rs16969968 polymorphism with smoking behavior in either African American case patients or African American control participants. The authors point out some limitations of no association with the studied phenotypes, as the sample size limited and also because individuals come from a single center; it is possible that some degree of population structure influenced the findings.\n\nThere are some limitations in our study that should be mentioned. First, most patients treated at the PAF were classified as moderately or highly dependent, which may have affected the analysis of association between genotypes and FTND score. Second, the race/color of patients was self-report and we did not performed genetic ancestry. Third, we did not perform the correction of *P* values for multiple testing. Fourth, besides the available variables used in the multivariate models other relevant factors that could be important, such as the functionality of the receptors, motivation to quit smoking, biopsychosocial and others factors related to sex/gender, could have influenced the results.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe showed that *CHRNA5* rs16969968 and rs2036527 polymorphisms were associated with higher rates of success in smoking cessation treatment in the female group. These results might contribute to advances in personalized medicine.\n\n## Additional files\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the patients who participated in the study.

The optimal timing of treatment, regimen and influence of host factors remain unclear. We aimed to measure sustained virological response (SVR) during recent HCV infection and identify predictors of response. Data were from five prospective cohorts of high-risk individuals in Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United States. Individuals with acute or early chronic HCV who commenced pegylated-interferon therapy were included. The main outcome was SVR, and predictors were assessed using logistic regression. Among 516 with documented recent HCV infection, 237 were treated (pegylated-interferon n=161; pegylated-interferon/ribavirin n=76) (30% female, median age 35 years, 56% ever injected drugs, median duration of infection 6.2 months). Sixteen percent (n=38) were HIV/HCV co-infected. SVR among those with HCV mono-infection was 64% by intention-to-treat; SVR was 68% among HCV/HIV co-infection. Independent predictors of SVR in HCV mono-infection were duration of HCV infection (the odds of SVR declined by 8% per month of infection, aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99, p=0.033), IFNL4 genotype (adjusted OR 2.27, 95%CI 1.13–4.56, p=0.021), baseline HCV RNA <400,000 IU/ml (aOR 2.06, 95%CI 1.03–4.12, p=0.041) and age ≥40yrs (versus <30: aOR 2.92, 95%CI 1.31–6.49, p=0.009), with no difference by drug regimen, HCV genotype, symptomatic infection, or gender. The effect of infection duration on odds of SVR was greater among genotype-1 infection. Interferon-based HCV treatment is highly effective in recent HCV infection. Duration of infection, IFNL4 genotype and baseline HCV RNA levels can predict virological response and may inform clinical decision making.\n\nKeywords: acute infection, Hepatitis C virus, recently acquired infection, virological response\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nInfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) progresses to chronic infection in 75% of cases, often leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ([1](#R1)). Interferon-alfa-based treatment of acute HCV infection can yield high sustained virological response (SVR) rates ([2](#R2)–[5](#R5)). The ideal time point for initiating treatment has not been firmly established, and uncertainty remains about optimal regimen and whether response can be predicted by host or viral genotype. Despite advances in direct acting agents for chronic HCV infection, none have been studied or licenced in acute HCV ([5](#R5)). Given the burden of HCV-related morbidity and mortality globally ([1](#R1)), and that interferon-based therapies are likely to remain the standard of care and most widely accessible therapy for some time (particularly in low- and middle-income countries) ([5](#R5)), a better understanding of treatment response during acute HCV infection is important.\n\nThe majority of people who spontaneously clear HCV following acute infection do so within six months ([6](#R6)). Therefore, it has become standard practice to delay therapeutic intervention three to six months after diagnosis to avoid unnecessary treatment ([4](#R4), [7](#R7)). Host genetic factors, such as polymorphisms of *interferon lambda-4* gene (*IFNL4*; also known as *interleukin-28B* [*IL28B*] or *interferon lambda-3* ([8](#R8))), are established predictors of virological clearance ([6](#R6)) and response in chronic HCV treatment ([9](#R9)). During recent HCV infection, genetic variations in *IFNL4* region have been associated with symptomatic infection and spontaneous clearance ([10](#R10), [11](#R11)). Yet amongst small cohorts of acute HCV infection, *IFNL4* genotype has not been established as a predictor of SVR.\n\nStudying acute HCV treatment has been limited by low detection rates of acute HCV cases, difficulty reaching the key affected population of people who inject drugs (PWID) due to social marginalisation, and the nature of interferon-based treatment. While demonstrating high SVR, the relatively small sample size of previous studies has limited statistical power to explore predictors of treatment response. The International Collaboration of Incidence HIV and Hepatitis C in Injecting Cohorts (InC^3^) Study ([6](#R6)) and the German Network for Competence on Viral Hepatitis (Hep-Net) ([3](#R3)) provide data from ten well-characterised, international cohorts of people with recently acquired HCV infection, and provides an opportunity to assess treatment response in a large number of individuals followed prospectively. The aims of this study were to describe SVR and time to HCV clearance and examine virological, genetic and treatment-based predictors of treatment response.\n\n## METHODS\n\nThe InC^3^ Study ([12](#R12)) and the Hep-Net Acute HCV III Study ([3](#R3)) have been previously described; five of the ten cohorts in these collaborations offered or collected information on treatment of recently acquired HCV. Data were included from four InC^3^ collaboration cohorts evaluating treatment response following recent HCV infection in Australia (Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C, and Hepatitis C Incidence and Transmission Study-Prison), Canada (St. Luc HEPCO Cohort) and the United States (Boston Acute HCV Study: Transmission, Immunity and Outcomes Network). The Hep-Net collaboration includes one prospective multi-centre study in Germany evaluating acute HCV treatment. For this current study, individuals receiving at least one dose of anti-viral treatment for documented recently acquired HCV were included.\n\nDocumented recently acquired HCV infection was based on either of the following criteria: (1) Acute clinical HCV infection, defined as symptomatic seroconversion illness or medically documented jaundice or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than ten times the upper limit of normal with exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis, and HCV RNA detection or high-risk exposure (injecting drug use, or proven/very probable percutaneous or sexual exposure to HCV) within the preceding four months; or (2) Asymptomatic HCV infection with seroconversion, defined by a negative anti-HCV test in the two years prior to the initial positive anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA test. All participants provided written informed consent and their protocols were approved by local institutional review boards.\n\n### HCV treatment and virological testing\n\nAll participants were treated using pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-alfa 2a (180μg weekly) or PEG-IFN-2b (1.5μg/kg weekly) alone or in combination with ribavirin (RBV, 800–1200mg daily) for a planned duration of 24 weeks in most (>95%) participants. PEG-IFN/RBV was used in HCV mono-infection at four sites, primarily where estimated duration of infection was >6 months; at one site immediate PEG-IFN initiation was randomised, compared to three-month deferred treatment ([3](#R3)). Clinical characteristics including gender, age, HIV and hepatitis B virus status, serum ALT, route of HCV acquisition, and injecting drug behaviour were collected and reported in a standardised manner. Virological testing was performed using different platforms at each site, but applied consistently within each cohort. Qualitative HCV RNA testing was performed using Versant TMA (Bayer, Australia, lower limit of detection [LLOD] <10IU/ml), COBAS Amplicor HCV Test v2 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany, LLOD <50 IU/ml) or COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman (Roche, USA, LLOD <15 IU/ml). Quantitative HCV RNA was performed using Versant HCV RNA 3.0 (Bayer, lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] <615 IU/ml), COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman (Roche Diagnostics, Germany LLOQ <15 IU/ml) or an in-house polymerase chain reaction assay (LLOQ<1000 IU/ml). HCV genotype was determined by line-probe assay (Versant LiPa1/LiPa2; Bayer, Australia) or HCV sequencing. *IFNL4* genotype was determined by sequencing of the rs12979860 or rs8099917 single-nucleotide polymorphism ([6](#R6), [13](#R13), [14](#R14)).\n\n### Study definitions\n\nRecently acquired HCV infection included acute (<6 months) and early chronic (6–24 months) infection. The estimated date of infection was defined using a hierarchy favouring symptomatic infection over asymptomatic antibody or RNA seroconversion dates. For cases of acute symptomatic HCV, date of infection was calculated as six weeks prior to onset of acute clinical symptoms, where jaundice or ALT elevation (>400 IU/ml) was recorded ([15](#R15)). The estimated date of infection for cases of acute asymptomatic HCV was calculated as the mid-point between last negative anti-HCV antibody and first positive anti-HCV antibody, except for participants who were anti-HCV antibody negative and HCV RNA positive at the diagnosis date of infection, where infection date was estimated four weeks prior ([16](#R16)–[18](#R18)). In a small number of cases (n=19) where other definitions could not be applied, participants with a high-risk HCV exposure within four months prior to first diagnosis had date of infection estimated from the date of exposure ([3](#R3)).\n\nThe estimated duration of infection at baseline was calculated as the time between estimated date of infection and date of treatment commencement. Adherence to treatment protocol was defined as receiving at least 80% of scheduled PEG-IFN or RBV doses or at least 80% of scheduled treatment period, and finishing study follow up at week 24. Among untreated participants, spontaneous clearance was defined as two negative HCV RNA tests greater than four weeks apart. Time to RNA clearance was estimated as the mid-point between last positive and first negative HCV RNA test among participants with spontaneous clearance and treatment-induced clearance.\n\n### Study Outcomes\n\nThe primary study outcome was the proportion of subjects achieving SVR, defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment. Secondary end-points included proportion with treatment response at weeks four (rapid virological response, RVR) and twelve (early virological response, EVR), and the time to HCV RNA clearance comparing treated and untreated participants with recent HCV infection. The primary outcome was assessed by intention-to-treat analysis including all participants receiving at least one PEG-IFN dose, with a secondary analysis examining adherent participants completing study follow up and achieving SVR (per-protocol analysis).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCategorical characteristics of participants with and without treatment outcome were compared using χ^2^ test and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Predictors of treatment response were analysed using univariable and multivariable random-effects logistic regression models to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Key hypotheses under investigation were that shorter duration of infection ([19](#R19)), HCV genotype (1 versus non-1) ([20](#R20)), favourable *IFNL4* genotype (rs12979860 CC versus non-CC) ([11](#R11), [13](#R13), [21](#R21)), and combination therapy (PEG-IFN+RBV versus PEG-IFN)([22](#R22)) would improve SVR stratified by HIV status. Potential predictors for exploration and adjustment were identified *a priori* including age (categorised as <30, 30–40 and >40 years), gender, weight (<75kg), baseline HCV RNA level (<400,000IU/ml), clinical presentation (symptomatic versus asymptomatic), duration of treatment, prior injecting drug use and cohort site.\n\nIn addition to hypothesised predictors of treatment response, other variables that were significant at the 0.20 level in the univariable analysis were considered as covariates in multivariable random-effects logistic regression. A backwards stepwise approach sequentially eliminated variables subject to the result of a likelihood ratio test, and the final model was evaluated using a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. We controlled for unobserved heterogeneity across cohort sites by including site as a random-effects term in multivariable models. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the definition of duration of HCV infection (reordering the definition hierarchy to seroconversion then symptomatic infection) and interactions (effect modification) between hypothesised predictors on SVR (gender and *IFNL4* genotype; gender and HCV genotype; HCV genotype and *IFNL4* genotype; and seroconversion illness and *IFNL4* genotype).\n\nTime to HCV RNA clearance comparing treated and untreated participants was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analyses to account for anticipated spontaneous clearances masked by successful treatment. Treated participants who did not achieve SVR were considered not to have cleared, regardless of any on-treatment virological suppression. For comparison with time to clearance in treated participants, untreated were included if they remained viraemic three months after estimated date of infection, approximating earliest treatment initiation. Cox proportional hazards analyses modelled time to HCV clearance by treatment status adjusted for gender, age, HCV genotype, symptomatic seroconversion, HCV RNA level, and *IFNL4* genotype. Hazard proportionality assumptions were assessed using scaled Schoenfeld residuals.\n\nDifferences were considered significant at the 0.05 level using two-sided p values. All analyses were conducted using Stata (v13.1, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, United States).\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Participant characteristics\n\nBetween 2004 and 2010, 516 cases of recent HCV infection were observed. Of these, 85 spontaneously cleared HCV infection, 194 had persisting untreated viraemia and 237 received at least one dose of PEG-IFN. Overall, 75% (178/237) completed >80% of planned treatment and were assessed at 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up. HCV treatment was initiated during acute HCV (0–6 months) in 46% (n=109), and early chronic HCV (6–24 months) in 49% (n=116), with 5% (n=12) having an unknown date of infection. Date of HCV infection was estimated by acute symptomatic illness in 48% (114/237), asymptomatic HCV-antibody seroconversion midpoint in 36% (86/237), HCV-antibody negative/RNA positive in 3% (6/237), or by high-risk HCV exposure in 8% (19/237).\n\nThe median age of treated participants was 35 years, 70% (n=166) were male, and the median duration of HCV at treatment commencement was 6.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.5–8.7) ([Table 1](#T1)). Among those with available data (n=155), a history of injecting drug use was reported by 86% (n=133). Overall, 62% had genotype-1 infection, 37% had genotype-2 or -3 infection ([Table 1](#T1)). HCV genotype distribution was similar between those with and without HIV co-infection.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Characteristic at Baseline | Treated, n (column %) |  |  | Untreated, n (column %) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | HCV mono-infected | HIV co-infected1 |  |  |\n| Overall | 237 | 197 | 38 | 194 |\n| Site |  |  |  |  |\n| ATAHC (Australia) | 105 (44%) | 69 (35%) | 36 (95%) | 22 (11%) |\n| BAHSTION (USA) | 13 (5%) | 9 (5%) | 2 (5%) | 28 (14%) |\n| HEPCO (Canada) | 21 (9%) | 21 (11%) | 0 | 47 (24%) |\n| Hep-Net (Germany) | 94 (40%) | 94 (48%) | 0 | 27 (14%) |\n| HITS-P (Australia) | 4 (2%) | 4 (2%) | 0 | 70 (36%) |\n| Age, years, median (IQR) | 35 (27–44) | 34 (26–42) | 42 (35–48) | 28 (23–36)2 |\n| Male Gender | 166 (70%) | 127 (64%) | 37 (97%) | 117 (70%) |\n| Weight, kg, median (IQR) | 74 (64–83) | 72 (61–83) | 77 (72–84) | 69 (60–81) |\n| Body mass index, kg/m2, median (IQR) | 23.8 (21.5–25.8) | 23.2 (21.1–26.0) | 24.7 (23.5–25.6) | 22.2 (20.3–25.6) |\n| Ethnicity |  |  |  |  |\n| European origin | 131 (55%) | 92 (47%) | 37 (97%) | 139 (72%) |\n| Non-European | 12 (11%) | 11 (5%) | 1 (3%) | 28 (14%) |\n| Not collected at site | 94 (40%) | 94 (48%) | 0 | 27 (14%) |\n| Injecting drug use |  |  |  |  |\n| Ever | 133 (56%) | 109 (55%) | 22 (58%) | 166 (85%) |\n| Never | 22 (9%) | 6 (3%) | 16 (42%) | 1 (<1%) |\n| Not collected at site | 82 (35%) | 82 (42%) | 0 | 27 (14%) |\n| Estimated duration of infection at treatment |   |   |   |   |\n| Months, median (IQR) | 6.2 (3.5–8.7) | 5.8 (3.0–8.7) | 7.0 (5.2–9.8) | – |\n| 0–3 months | 49 (21%) | 47 ( 24%) | 2 (5%) | – |\n| 3–6 months | 60 (25%) | 50 (25%) | 10 (26%) | – |\n| >6 months | 116 (49%) | 90 (46%) | 24 (63%) | – |\n| Missing | 12 (5%) | 10 (5%) | 2 (5%) | – |\n| Presentation of HCV |  |  |  |  |\n| Seroconversion illness | 139 (59%) | 122 (62%) | 17 (45%) | 81 (42%) |\n| Jaundice | 77/139 (55%) | 71/122 (58%) | 6/17 (35%) | 2/63 (33%) |\n| ALT ≥400 IU/ml | 101/139 (73%) | 86/122 (70%) | 15/17 (88%) | 6/73 (86%) |\n| Asymptomatic infection | 83 (35%) | 65 (33%) | 18 (47%) | 56 (29%) |\n| Missing | 15 (6%) | 10 (5%) | 3 (8%) | 57 (29%) |\n| HIV co-infection |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes | 38 (16%) | N/A | 38 (100%) | 7 (4%) |\n| No | 197 (83%) | 197 (100%) | N/A | 181 (93%) |\n| Missing | 2 (1%) | 0 | 0 | 6 (3%) |\n| HCV RNA screening |  |  |  |  |\n| Log10 IU/mL, median (IQR) | 5.5 (4.4–6.2) | 5.3 (4.3–6.1) | 6.2 (5.0–6.5) | 5.4 (4.6–6.2) |\n| <400,000 IU/ml | 116 (49%) | 104 (53%) | 12 (32%) | 75 (45%) |\n| ≥400,000 IU/ml | 103 (43%) | 75 (38%) | 26 (68%) | 55 (34%) |\n| Quantitative RNA missing | 18 (8%) | 18 (9%) | 0 | 64 (22%) |\n| ALT peak, IU/ml, median (IQR) | 569 (250–1236) | 535 (216–1198) | 685 (285–1514) | 265 (133–663) |\n| HCV genotype |  |  |  |  |\n| Genotype 1 | 139 (59%) | 113 (57%) | 24 (63%) | 72 (37%) |\n| Genotype 2 | 18 (8%) | 16 (8%) | 2 (5%) | 5 (3%) |\n| Genotype 3 | 65 (27%) | 54 (27%) | 11 (29%) | 74 (38%) |\n| Genotype 4 | 1 (<1%) | 1 (<1%) | 0 | 2 (1%) |\n| Genotype 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 (1%) |\n| Mixed genotype | 2 (<1%) | 2 (1%) | 0 | 9 (5%) |\n| Unknown genotype | 12 (5%) | 11 (6%) | 1 (3%) | 30 (20%) |\n| IFNL4 genotype |  |  |  |  |\n| CC | 112 (47%) | 91 (46%) | 21 (55%) | 69 (36%) |\n| CT | 82 (35%) | 71 (36%) | 11 (29%) | 60 (31%) |\n| TT | 19 (8%) | 13 (7%) | 4 (11%) | 12 (6%) |\n| Missing | 24 (10%) | 22 (11%) | 2 (5%) | 53 (27%) |\n| Treatment regimen |  |  |  |  |\n| PEG-IFN | 161 (68%) | 161 (82%) | 0 | – |\n| 16 weeks | 9/161 (6%) | 9/161 (6%) | 0 | – |\n| 24 weeks | 152/161 (94%) | 152/161 (94%) | 0 | – |\n| PEG-IFN & RBV | 76 (32%) | 36 (18%) | 38 (100%) | – |\n| 24 weeks | 72/76 (95%) | 32/36 (89%) | 38 (100%) | – |\n| 48 weeks | 4/76 (5%) | 4/36 (11%) | 0 | – |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Characteristics of participants with recently acquired HCV Infection, excluding spontaneous clearance, by treatment and HIV status\n\nTreated participants were older (35 versus 28 years, p<0.001), and more likely to have HIV co-infection (16% versus 4%, p<0.001) and symptomatic HCV infection (59% versus 42%, p<0.001), compared with untreated individuals. A similar proportion of treated and untreated participants had the favourable CC allele (53% versus 49%, p=0.502).\n\n### Treatment disposition\n\nTreatment outcomes were analysed separately for HIV/HCV co-infected individuals given systematic differences in treatment regimen and HIV inclusion criteria across sites. All 38 HIV/HCV co-infected participants received PEG-IFN+RBV for 24 weeks. In contrast, those with HCV monoinfection (n=197) received PEG-IFN alone for 16 weeks (n=9, 4%) or 24 weeks (n=152, 78%), or PEG-IFN+RBV for 24 weeks (n=32, 16%) or 48 weeks (n=4, 2%). In contrast to HCV mono-infected participants, treated HIV co-infected participants were older (41 versus 33 years, p=0.002), predominantly male (97% versus 64%, p<0.001), and be more likely to have asymptomatic infection (47% versus 33%, p<0.001) compared to HCV mono-infected participants.\n\n### HCV mono-infection treatment outcomes\n\nAmong HCV mono-infected participants, 78% (153/197) completed at least 80% of planned treatment duration and PEG-IFN doses. Overall, undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4, 12 and end of treatment were observed in 87 (44%), 138 (70%), and 139 (71%), respectively. In the intention to treat population, SVR was 64% (126/197), compared to 83% (122/147) among the per-protocol population ([Figure 1](#F1)). Lower SVR in the intention to treat population are accounted for primarily by poor adherence (n=16), early discontinuation for medical reasons (n=10) or incomplete follow up (n=14).\n\n### Figure 1. Treatment response rates at end of treatment (ETR) and SVR.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4605/4618180/afaf59dc9d08/nihms702509f1.jpg)\n\n(A) HCV monoinfected.

Data on injecting behaviour were not collected at one site (n=82, 35%), and complete treatment success among those few (n=6) HCV monoinfected individuals who reported never injecting drugs prevented inclusion of injecting drug use in the adjusted model.

Duration of HCV infection also independently predicted SVR; for each month since estimated infection, the odds of SVR declined by 8% (aOR 0.92, 95%CI 0.85–0.99, p=0.033; linearity assumptions verified graphically). SVR was 72%, 68%, 57%, respectively, when duration of infection was <3 months, 3 to 6 months, or >6 months from estimated infection date.\n\nWhile not independently predicting SVR, HCV genotype had a significant effect modification on the association between duration of infection with SVR (p=0.043) and potentially modified the association between *IFNL4* genotype and SVR (p=0.099). Duration of infection more strongly predicted SVR among HCV genotype-1 individuals (aOR 0.84 per month of infection, 95% CI 0.75–0.95) than non-genotype-1 (aOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84–1.14) ([Figure 2](#F2)). *IFNL4* genotype tended to predict SVR more strongly among genotype-1 infected individuals (aOR 4.13, 95% CI 1.52–11.24) than non-genotype-1 infection (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 0.41–4.14). Among HCV genotype-1 monoinfected individuals, SVR was 75% among those with favourable *IFNL4* genotype compared to SVR 50% among *IFNL4* unfavourable (non-CC) ([Figure 3](#F3)). There was no interaction between *IFNL4* and gender on SVR.\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4605/4618180/cd1ba8146bec/nihms702509f2.jpg)\n\nInfluence of estimated duration of infection on SVR among HCV monoinfected participants, by HCV genotype (n=171)\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4605/4618180/f8198daf422b/nihms702509f3.jpg)\n\nInfluence of IFNL4 genotype on SVR among HCV monoinfected participants, by HCV genotype (n=164)\n\nIn sensitivity analyses, the results did not change significantly when the methodology for estimating the date of infection was modified.\n\n### HCV/HIV co-infection treatment outcomes\n\nAmong HCV/HIV co-infected individuals, 79% (30/38) completed at least 80% of planned treated duration and PEG-IFN doses. Undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4, 12 and end of treatment were observed in 17 (45%), 30 (79%), and 29 (76%), respectively. In the ITT population, SVR was 68% (26/38), compared to 83% (24/29) among the per-protocol population ([Figure 1](#F1)). Most of the treated HIV infected individuals were recruited in the Australian ATAHC cohort (36 out of 38), who have been previously well characterised ([2](#R2), [23](#R23)).\n\nIn unadjusted analysis, SVR was more likely among HCV non-genotype-1 infection (92%) compared with genotype-1 infection (53%, p=0.038) ([Supplementary Table 1](#SD1)). There was no difference in SVR between injectors and non-injectors (64% versus 75%, p=0.459). There was no association between SVR and other predictors of treatment response in the univariable model. Of note, all HCV/HIV co-infected individuals received combined PEG-IFN and RBV therapy, and all but one individual were male, limiting exploration of these factors as predictors of response. In models adjusted for age and site, there remained an association between SVR and HCV genotype (genotype non-1 versus genotype-1: aOR 0.09, 95%CI 0.01–0.84, p=0.035) in those with HIV/HCV co-infection. Sensitivity analyses substituted other *a priori* predictors into the adjusted model, including *IFNL4* genotype, symptomatic infection, and HCV RNA, but none provided better fit of the data or affect the observed association between SVR and HCV genotype.\n\n### Effect of HCV treatment on clearance\n\nGiven the observation that duration of infection was associated with treatment response, time to HCV clearance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses ([Figure 4](#F4)). At 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after estimated date of infection, clearance had occurred spontaneously in 11%, 18%, 22% and 22% cumulative of untreated participants, compared to 29%, 60%, 71%, 78% of treated participants, respectively. In Cox proportional hazards regression, treatment was independently associated with HCV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 5.00, 95% CI 3.29—7.60, p<0.001) adjusted for age, gender, HCV genotype and *IFNL4* genotype ([Table 3](#T3)). Gender interacted significantly with the effect of treatment on HCV monoinfection RNA clearance (Treatment v no treatment aHR among males: 8.38, 95% CI 4.46–15.75; aHR among females: 2.47, 95% CI 1.38—4.45); interaction term p=0.034, [Figure 4](#F4)). Cox proportional hazards assumptions were not violated (p=0.229).\n\n### Figure 4.

The findings reinforce that treatment of recent HCV with PEG-IFN is effective, including among people who inject drugs and those with HIV co-infection. This study demonstrated for the first time that variations in the *IFNL4* gene are associated with acute treatment response to PEG-IFN-based therapy in genotype-1 infection. There was no improvement in SVR when RBV was added to PEG-IFN in recent HCV mono-infection independent of duration of infection. Finally, this study also provides important evidence for commencing PEG-IFN treatment during acute rather than early chronic HCV infection given declining SVR over time, particularly among HCV genotype-1 infected individuals, after taking into account age, HCV RNA level and *IFNL4* genotype in clinical decisions.\n\nThere have been several recent advances in chronic HCV treatment and it is expected that new direct acting antiviral therapies will be highly efficacious when studied in acute HCV infection ([5](#R5), [7](#R7)). However, resource limitations, cost-effectiveness and licensing restrictions could mean that PEG-IFN-monotherapy – particularly among HCV mono-infected individuals with favourable treatment response characteristics – remains a default treatment approach in many settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. As such, this study makes significant contribution to the appropriate targeting of treatment to those with predictors of SVR and demonstrates benefits of early treatment initiation following acute HCV.\n\nA meta-analysis found PEG-IFN therapy initiated at 12 weeks following infection yield a pooled SVR of 82%, compared with treatment started at 12–24 weeks (66% SVR) and >24 weeks (62% SVR), but heterogeneity in effect estimates, study methodology, and no head-to-head comparison of treatment duration limit those findings ([24](#R24), [25](#R25)). The current study’s results were consistent with SVR 72%, 68%, 57% at less than 3 months, 3–6 months, and greater than six months after infection, indicating acute treatment is superior to early chronic treatment for HCV genotype-1 infection. However, this study includes a large sample size and similar study definitions applied across sites to provide a robust estimate of the virological consequence of deferring recently acquired HCV therapy. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of patients treated with acute HCV infection worldwide to date.\n\nThe observation that the effect of duration of infection on SVR was enhanced in HCV genotype-1 infection may be consistent with emerging prospective data indicating genotype-1 ([6](#R6), [20](#R20), [26](#R26)), rather than genotype-3 ([27](#R27)), infected individuals have higher rates of spontaneous clearance, since some treated individuals may have gone on to spontaneously clear. Higher spontaneous clearance of genotype-1 may also explain the observation that HCV genotype does not appear to predict SVR in recent infection, unlike in chronic infection. However, this study found substantially higher HCV RNA clearance using PEG-IFN-monotherapy compared with no treatment from three months after estimated infection, independent of factors associated with spontaneous clearance. This provides evidence to support current guidelines and previous research that generally recommend treatment initiation three months after estimated date of HCV infection ([3](#R3), [7](#R7), [28](#R28)). The effect of male gender increasing likelihood of treatment-induced clearance compared to spontaneous clearance is also consistent with previous research that demonstrated an association between female gender and spontaneous clearance ([29](#R29), [30](#R30)). The relative effect of male gender versus female gender on treatment-induced clearance is best demonstrated in the Kaplan-Meier curve ([Figure 4](#F4)): the effect modification of gender on treatment-induced clearance appears primarily due to differential spontaneous clearance probabilities between females and male. Female and male treated groups appear have similar likelihood of clearance.\n\n*IFNL4* genotype is strongly associated with SVR in chronic HCV infection ([9](#R9), [14](#R14)), It is the strongest predictor of PEG-based treatment response in genotype-1 infection ([21](#R21)), and its effect in HCV genotypes 2, 3 and 4 infection is weaker but still significant ([31](#R31)–[33](#R33)). Smaller studies have failed to detect a relationship between *IFNL4* genotype and SVR in recently acquired infection treatment previously – including among individual InC3 sites ([10](#R10), [22](#R22)). The large sample size in this analysis allowed an independent effect of *IFNL4* genotype in recent infection to be demonstrated for the first time. While the effect modification of HCV genotype on *IFNL4* genotype did not reach statistical significance here, it is plausible and consistent that genotype-1 and favourable *IFNL4* genotype combined will strongly predict SVR in recent infection.\n\nLow baseline HCV RNA level (less than 400,000IU/ml) predicts improved SVR in chronic HCV mono-infection ([34](#R34), [35](#R35)). This is consistent with our findings, despite some variations in quantitative HCV RNA platforms used in this study. The observation that older age (>40 compared with <30 years) is independently associated with SVR among HCV mono-infected is contradictory to other data indicating lower SVR with advancing age in chronic HCV ([36](#R36), [37](#R37)). While age might be a surrogate for undiagnosed cirrhosis in long-standing HCV infection, and hence results in lower SVR ([38](#R38)), in recent infection HCV-mediated fibrosis should be absent or minimal. In this cohort where a large proportion report injecting drug use, age is more likely to be a proxy for adherence and social stability which could both increase SVR ([2](#R2)). In a per-protocol analysis to explore the effect of unmeasured confounders affecting adherence, the relationship between age and SVR was no longer statistically significant (age >40yrs versus <30yrs: aOR 2.09, 95% CI 0.52–8.41).\n\nThis analysis has several limitations. Treatment data was merged from five cohorts but primarily came from two cohorts. Variations in study measurement and assessment introduce heterogeneity into any merged analysis, which cannot be completely adjusted for despite statistical corrections. Several variables of clinical interest relating to injecting drug use, substance use and behaviour were differentially collected across sites, precluding their use in the analysis. Similarities in treatment length (95% received 24 weeks PEG-IFN) limit our ability to comment on differences treatment duration, although recent randomised trial data indicate equivalent response at 12 and 24 weeks in acute HCV mono-infection ([39](#R39)). While there was no apparent additional benefit of RBV to PEG-IFN in HCV mono-infection, the small numbers receiving combination therapy (n=36) limits power to detect small differences. Considered in light of other recent randomised data and additional toxicity from RBV use, there is no indication for combination PEG-IFN/RBV in acute HCV mono-infection ([39](#R39)). The small number of HCV/HIV co-infected participants limits our ability to generalise predictors of treatment response seen here to other settings. Nevertheless, the SVR of 68% (and 83% among adherent participants) is an impressive treatment response compared to chronic HCV treatment in HIV co-infection ([40](#R40)), and particularly considering delays before new HCV antivirals will become accessible for routine use in HIV co-infection. This study’s strengths are that it is largest pooled study of acute HCV treatment to date, data were prospectively collected in well characterised cohorts, and statistical adjustment for heterogeneity between study sites was made using a conservative random effects method.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nRecently acquired HCV can be treated successfully with IFN-based therapies. SVR is at least comparable to IFN-based treatment of chronic HCV infection which requires longer and more complex combination therapy. Treatment initiation three months after estimated date of HCV infection is optimal, and offers substantially higher HCV RNA clearance than no treatment, independent of other factors associated with spontaneous clearance. Clinical decisions on whether to offer treatment in recently acquired HCV infection should consider *IFNL4* genotype, HCV RNA level and time since infection, particularly amongst genotype-1 infected individuals.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n**Financial Support:**\n\nThe InC3 Study is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Award Number R01DA031056.

This study investigated the effect of different interleukin (IL) 28B genetic variants on interferon (IFN)-based therapy response. We genotyped eight IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a cohort of 197 hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfected patients from our clinic unit who received combined pegylated (peg)-IFN-α and ribavirin (RBV) therapy. This analysis included the two strongest tag predictors for HCV clearance, rs8099917 and rs12979860, and four causal variants (rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) located in the IL28B promoter, coding, and 3′-untranslated regions. Haplotypes carrying the major alleles at IL28B SNPs were highly associated with sustained virological responses (SVRs) after treatment with peg-IFN-α and RBV [odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6–4.0, 4.0×10−5]. Three causal SNP genotypes (rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) displayed the highest association with SVRs (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.0–6.7, p = 1.3×10−5). All four causal variants were in high linkage disequilibrium, both among themselves (r2≥0.94) and with the rs12979860 variant (r2≥0.92). In contrast, rs8099917 was in low linkage disequilibrium with the four causal variants (r2≤0.45) and with the rs12979860 variant (r2 = 0.45). These results demonstrate that rs12979860, compared to rs8099917, may be a better predictor of response to the peg-IFN/RBV treatment among HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients. Moreover, causal IL28B variants are strongly associated with treatment SVRs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe combination of pegylated interferon alpha (peg-IFN-α) with ribavirin (RBV) has been used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, a sustained virological response (SVR; a negative hepatitis C polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test 6 months after cessation of therapy) for individuals infected with HCV genotypes 1 or 4 ranges between 40% and 50%. Patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 typically achieve SVRs of nearly 75% after only 6 months of therapy [[1]](#pone.0031016-Fried1), [[2]](#pone.0031016-Manns1), [[3]](#pone.0031016-Fried2), [[4]](#pone.0031016-Hadziyannis1). HCV genotype has been the most important predictive factor regarding the treatment response of HCV-infected patients. Nevertheless, host factors such as age, sex, race, liver fibrosis, and obesity have also been associated with peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy outcome [[5]](#pone.0031016-Gao1), [[6]](#pone.0031016-Walsh1). Four genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that several highly-correlated, common, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located near the interleukin 28B gene (IL28B) strongly predict an SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy [[7]](#pone.0031016-Ge1), [[8]](#pone.0031016-Suppiah1), [[9]](#pone.0031016-Tanaka1), [[10]](#pone.0031016-Rauch1). Il28B polymorphisms have been also strongly associated with SVR in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients [[11]](#pone.0031016-Rallon1), [[12]](#pone.0031016-Pineda1), [[13]](#pone.0031016-Rallon2), [[14]](#pone.0031016-Labarga1), [[15]](#pone.0031016-Clausen1), [[16]](#pone.0031016-Dayyeh1). Two SNPs in particular (rs12979860 and rs8099917, located 3 and 7.5 kb upstream of the IL28B gene, respectively) were the strongest predictors for HCV clearance. The recent approval of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) molecules, the NS3 protease inhibitors telaprevir and bocebrevir, active on HCV will represent a major breakthrough for HCV infected patients. Because of the low genetic resistance of first-generation protease inhibitors most failures to a triple combination of peg-IFN-α/RBV and either telaprevir o boceprevir will be due to a poor response to peg-IFN-α and RBV. Predictors of SVR to former triple combination will be also included the IL28B genotype. To determine the best SNP to predict a response to peg-IFN-α/RBV treatment, we studied the effect of different IL28B genetic variants on IFN-based therapy response. Not only will this data refine IL28b based predictions of treatment response, it may also inform studies of IL28b mechanism in HCV response.\n\nAlthough the rs12979860 and rs8099917 genotypes have been independently associated with HCV treatment outcome, whether these SNPs play a causal role or are merely tagging other unknown causal variants remains to be elucidated. IL28B (which encodes IFN-λ3) up-regulates interferon-stimulated genes, similar to IFN-α and IFN-β, but via a different receptor. There is also evidence that IFN-λ 3 affects the adaptive immune response [[17]](#pone.0031016-Robek1), [[18]](#pone.0031016-Marcello1). Moreover, IFN-λ molecules inhibit HCV replication in vitro, and trials of IFN-λ1 in HCV-infected patients have demonstrated promising results that suggest a mechanistic link between IL28B variants and HCV treatment outcome [[19]](#pone.0031016-Balagopal1). Recently, four SNPs located in the promoter (rs4803219 and rs28416813), coding (rs8103142), and 3′-untranslated (rs4803217) regions of IL28B have been shown to be highly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance [[20]](#pone.0031016-diIulio1). Therefore, we assessed the influence of four causal IL28B variants (rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) on SVR to IFN-based therapies, and compared the relationships of these four causal SNPs with the tag IL28B variants rs12979860 and rs8099917.\n\nWe previously established the strong relationships between the rs8099917 G allele and treatment failure in our cohort of HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients [[21]](#pone.0031016-Aparicio1). In the present study, was examined the effect of eight different IL28B genetic variants on IFN-based therapeutic response in these patients.\n\n## Results\n\nIn a recent study, four causal SNPs (rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) were associated with the two tagging SNPs that were most strongly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance (rs12979860 and rs8099917) [[20]](#pone.0031016-diIulio1). In this study, the four causal SNPs and two tagged SNPs were genotyped along with two additional SNPs, rs11881222 and rs8113007, which are located in the second IL28B intron and 7.5 kb upstream of the IL28B gene, respectively ([Figure 1](#pone-0031016-g001)). These eight SNPs were genotyped in a cohort of 197 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients from our clinic unit who received standard combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The clinical characteristics and HCV treatment responses of the197 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients included in the study are summarized in [Table 1](#pone-0031016-t001). Most patients were on antiretroviral therapy (n = 196, 99.5%), and most patients had controlled HIV-1 replication (n = 169, 86%). Eighty-three patients (42%) responded successfully to HCV treatment (i.e., achieved SVR). When the HIV-1 viral load was compared in the HIV-1 viremic patients (n = 28, 14%), no significant differences were observed between SVRs and patients failing therapy (p = 0.1612, Mann-Whitney U test). Similarly, the length of time patients were under antiretroviral treatment did not impact HCV SVR (p = 0.3439, Mann-Whitney U test). HCV genotype was significantly associated with SVR in our study cohort (p = 7.2×10^−5^) ([Table 1](#pone-0031016-t001)). Unexpectedly, older patients were more likely to achieve HCV SVR (p = 0.0223) ([Table 1](#pone-0031016-t001)). Nevertheless, the difference between the means was very limited (48.5 vs 47 years). A moderate association with SVR was also observed with patient AST liver enzyme level (p = 0.0353), and HCV viral load (p = 0.0120). These four clinical parameters are known to be associated with HCV treatment response.\n\n### Figure 1.

Three causal major alleles, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217, demonstrated the highest individual associations with SVRs (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.8–4.6, p = 6.6×10^−6^) ([Table 2](#pone-0031016-t002)). As shown in [Table 3](#pone-0031016-t003), genotype distributions of all tested IL28B SNPs were significantly different among patients experiencing an SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV treatment. Again, the causal SNPs rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217 demonstrated the highest associations with SVRs (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.0–6.7, p = 1.3×10^−5^) ([Table 3](#pone-0031016-t003)). The four causal variants were in high linkage disequilibrium among themselves (r^2^≥0.94) and with the tag rs12979860 variant (r^2^≥0.92) ([Figure 2](#pone-0031016-g002)). Importantly, rs8099917 was in low linkage disequilibrium with the four causal variants (r^2^≤0.45) and with the rs12979860 variant (r^2^ = 0.45), demonstrating that this SNP was only moderately linked to the causal SNPs in the IL28B gene. Notably, the tag rs8113007 variant (which is separated from the rs8099917 SNP by only 72 nucleotides) displayed intermediate linkage with the tag rs12979860 (r^2^ = 0.78) and the causal IL28B gene SNPs (r^2^ = 0.77–0.82). The rs11881222 SNP, located in the second IL28B intron ([Figure 1](#pone-0031016-g001)), was highly linked to both the causal IL28B SNPs (r^2^≥0.92) and the tag rs12979860 variant (r^2^ = 0.92) ([Figure 2](#pone-0031016-g002)).\n\n### Table 2.

An empty square represents r2 = 1.0.\n\nHaplotypes carrying major alleles at IL28B were most strongly associated with an SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.6–4.0, p = 4.0×10^−5^) ([Table 4](#pone-0031016-t004)). These major haplotypes were visibly augmented in patients experiencing an SVR ([Tables 2](#pone-0031016-t002) and [4](#pone-0031016-t004)). Nevertheless, the prognostic value of the eight haplotypes together was not higher than the ORs obtained when the different haplotypes were analyzed individually ([Table 2](#pone-0031016-t002)). Importantly, homozygosity for the three of the four causal IL28B gene SNPs, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217, was completely linked to the rs12979860 major CC genotype (r^2^ = 1.0). In contrast, the rs8099917 major TT genotype demonstrated a lower correlation with homozygosity of these three causal IL28B gene SNPs (r^2^ = 0.83).\n\n### Table 4.

Specifically, di Iulio et al. report the strong association of four SNPs located in the promoter, coding, and 3′-untranslated regions of IL28B with spontaneous HCV clearance [[20]](#pone.0031016-diIulio1). However, this study did not focus on patients treated with IFN-based therapies. In the present study, we tested the influence of four causal IL28B variants (rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) on SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy, and compared the relationships of these four causal SNPs with the tag IL28B variants rs12979860 and rs8099917.\n\nIn the present cohort of HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients, three major causal IL28B variant haplotypes (rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217, located in the promoter, coding, and 3′-untranslated regions of IL28B) were highly associated with SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. Moreover, these three haplotypes, which were in perfect linkage equilibrium among themselves (r^2^ = 1.0), had a higher odds ratio regarding HCV clearance than the three tag IL28B SNPs tested here (rs8099917, rs8113007, and rs12979860). Two of these tag SNPs, rs8099917 and rs12979860, demonstrated the strongest associations with HCV clearance in the above-mentioned genome-wide association studies and are currently being introduced in clinical algorithms to predict SVR to IFN-based therapies. Another important finding of our study is the strong linkage of the tag rs12979860 variant with the IL28B causal SNPs. Homozygosity for the tag rs12979860 variant completely tagged (r^2^ = 1.0) homozygosity for three major causal SNPs: rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217. This result suggests that rs12979860 may be a better marker for IL28B phenotype than rs8099917 or rs8113007. These findings extend those of di Iulio et al., confirming that rs12979860 can be a better predictor for HCV clearance, as well as underscoring the strong association of causal IL28B SNPs with HCV clearance [[20]](#pone.0031016-diIulio1). Most notably, to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the association of IL28B tag and causal variants with patient response to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. These results provide compelling evidence for the relationship between IL28B tag and causal variants, and suggest possible involvement of the IL28B gene product, IFN-λ3, in SVR to IFN-based therapies. However, some limitations are worth noting. First, our study was restricted to an ethnically and epidemiologically homogeneous cohort of HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients attending our clinic. Future work should include other ethnic and patient cohorts. Second, as previously suggested [[20]](#pone.0031016-diIulio1), functional studies are needed to precisely identify the host gene variants implicated in the control of HCV infection. Two studies found higher levels of IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 messenger RNAs in PBMCs from healthy individuals carrying the homozygous rs8099917 genotype associated with HCV clearance [[8]](#pone.0031016-Suppiah1), [[9]](#pone.0031016-Tanaka1). However, another study observed no association between hepatic expression of IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 and rs8099917 genotype [[23]](#pone.0031016-Honda1).\n\nIn short, the data shown here strongly support the association of tag and causal IL28B variants with HCV clearance after IFN-based therapy. Nevertheless, there were patients carrying alleles associated with clearance who did not clear the virus, as well as patients that carrying alleles not associated with clearance who were able to clear the virus. These results suggest that further studies should be conducted to investigate IL28B genetics, as well as other genetic factors associated with HCV clearance.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Patients\n\nOne hundred ninety-seven Caucasian HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients from our HIV clinic unit who had a standard course of treatment with peg-IFN-α plus RBV with known virological response at 24 weeks post-treatment were included in this study. Treatment success (i.e., achieved SVR) was defined as undetectable plasma HCV RNA using a sensitive reverse transcriptase PCR assay 24 weeks after treatment cessation. HCV genotype, HCV viral load, HIV-1 viral load, CD4+ T cell count and liver enzyme levels.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from each patient who participated in the study. Similarly, ethical approval was obtained from our Institutional Review Board (Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol).\n\n### DNA collection and extraction\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the QuickExtract DNA Extraction Protocol (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies) as previously described [[21]](#pone.0031016-Aparicio1).\n\n### Genotyping of SNPs\n\nSNP genotyping was performed by PCR amplification and direct PCR sequencing. The rs8099917 and rs8113007 variants were PCR amplified and sequenced with oligonucleotides rs8099917–128 (*5′-GTGCATATGTTTTCTGAC-3′*, sense) and rs8099917–556 (*5′-GAGGCCCCTCACCCATGC-3′*, antisense). The PCR amplification mixture contained 5 µl of PBMC genomic DNA solution, 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide, 200 µM deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 2 mM MgSO4, 1× high-fidelity PCR buffer (Invitrogen), and 0.25 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a total reaction volume of 50 µl. Cycling parameters were one cycle of denaturation at 94°C for 2 min; and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 68°C for 30 s. Extension was followed by a 7-min incubation at 68°C. The resulting 430-nucleotide PCR product was sequenced using two flanking PCR oligonucleotides (rs8099917–128 and rs8099917–556) in conjunction with the Big Dye v3.1 kit and the 3100 DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) as described previously [[21]](#pone.0031016-Aparicio1). Sequence alignment and editing were performed using the Sequencer version 4.1 (GeneCodes) software program. The rs12979860 SNP was amplified and sequenced with oligonucleotides rs12979860–13 (*5′-GACGAGAGGGCGTTAGAGC-3′*, sense) and rs12979860–595 (*5′-GAGGGACCGCTACGTAAGTC-3′*, antisense). PCR and sequence conditions were identical to those described above. To genotype the rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, rs11881222, and rs4803217 variants, a 3308-nucleotide genomic fragment was amplified with oligonucleotides IL-28-3308F (*5′-GAGCAGGTGGAATCCTCTTG-3′*, sense) and IL-28-3308R (*5′-AGCAGGCACCTTGAAATGTC-3′*, antisense). PCR conditions were as described above, but with PCR extension for 3 min at 68°C. Sequencing oligonucleotides for this fragment were IL-28-3308F, IL-28-3308R, rs8103142RV (*5′-CCATCCTCCCAGCAGTTAACCTCCC-3′*, sense), 2SNPRV (*5′-TCCCTCCAGCTGCTCATCTGGC-3′*, sense), and rs4803217RV (*5′-CCCAGACAGCCCCTGACCCA-3′*, sense).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe Mann-Whitney U test, unpaired *t*-test, and Chi-squared tests were used to analyze treatment baseline covariates. Chi-squared tests and contingency tables were used to asses host genetic associations and to calculate the p-values, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals. The above Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (San Diego, CA, USA). Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analyses were performed using Haploview 4.2 [[24]](#pone.0031016-Barrett1).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Ester Ballana for helpful and fruitful discussions.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

Methotrexate (MTX), the most used drug in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, showing variability in clinical response, is often associated with genetic polymorphisms. This study aimed to elucidate the role of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and aminoimidazole carboxamide adenosine ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) T675C polymorphisms and clinicopathological variables in clinical response to MTX in Portuguese RA patients. Methods. Study included 233 RA patients treated with MTX for at least six months. MTHFR C677T and ATIC T675C polymorphisms were genotyped and clinicopathological variables were collected. Statistical analyses were performed and binary logistic regression method adjusted to possible confounding variables. Results. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that MTHFR 677TT (OR = 4.63; P = 0.013) and ATIC 675T carriers (OR = 5.16; P = 0.013) were associated with over 4-fold increased risk for nonresponse. For clinicopathological variables, noncurrent smokers (OR = 7.98; P = 0.001), patients positive to anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (OR = 3.53; P = 0.004) and antinuclear antibodies (OR = 2.28; P = 0.045), with higher health assessment questionnaire score (OR = 2.42; P = 0.007), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users (OR = 2.77; P = 0.018) were also associated with nonresponse. Contrarily, subcutaneous administration route (OR = 0.11; P < 0.001) was associated with response. Conclusion. Our study suggests that MTHFR C677T and ATIC T675C genotyping combined with clinicopathological data may help to identify patients whom will not benefit from MTX treatment and, therefore, assist clinicians in personalizing RA treatment.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease characterized by an inflammation of the joints with an autoimmune profile and the most widely used disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for RA treatment is methotrexate (MTX) [[1](#B1)]. Despite MTX cost-effectiveness, clinical response to MTX varies widely [[2](#B2)]. The factors that are possibly influencing disease course and therapeutic outcome can be classified into (1) clinicopathological variables, which can be divided into patient-related variables (age, gender, ethnicity, and comorbidities), disease-related variables (duration, activity, disability, and biomarkers), and treatment-related variables (compliance, dose, and previous drugs used) [[3](#B3)–[9](#B9)], and (2) genetic factors, such as genetic polymorphisms implicated in key MTX pathway genes [[2](#B2), [10](#B10)–[15](#B15)]. Several studies have been performed in order to evaluate the influence of clinicopathological variables in clinical response to MTX [[3](#B3), [5](#B5), [7](#B7), [16](#B16), [17](#B17)]; nevertheless, there is no consensus on which factors can be used as predictors [[18](#B18)]. Pharmacogenomics has raised great interest and, in fact, some studies have attempted to clarify the influence of genetic variations on clinical response to MTX [[19](#B19)].\n\nMTX is an antifolate drug, with antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects, by inhibition of folate and adenosine pathways and also inhibition of purines and pyrimidines synthesis ([Figure 1](#fig1)) [[16](#B16), [20](#B20), [21](#B21)]. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme involved in folate pathway, is responsible for the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) that acts as a carbon donor for the remethylation of homocysteine into methionine [[22](#B22)]. On the other hand, methionine can be transformed into S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and then to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), which can be reversibly hydrolyzed into adenosine and homocysteine [[23](#B23)]. Despite the fact that MTHFR is not directly inhibited by MTX or by its polyglutamated forms (MTXPG), its expression levels seem to influence MTX effect by modifying the folate* status* [[16](#B16)]. Additionally, it is known that aminoimidazole carboxamide adenosine ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase (ATIC), an enzyme involved in the* de novo *purine synthesis pathway responsible for the conversion of AICAR into formyl-AICAR (FAICAR), is directly inhibited by MTXPG, causing intracellular accumulation of AICAR [[16](#B16)]. AICAR and its metabolites can then inhibit two enzymes, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 (AMPD1), which are involved in adenosine metabolism, thus leading to increased intracellular concentrations of adenosine and its consequent release to the extracellular space [[21](#B21)]. This release contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of MTX since adenosine is a potent anti-inflammatory agent [[21](#B21)].\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/da7c/4055378/470e02d6efd5/BMRI2014-368681.001.jpg)\n\nMethotrexate action mechanism. Left panel represents the intervention of MTX in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, folate, and methionine pathways by the inhibition of key enzymes. Right panel shows the effect of MTX in de novo purine synthesis and adenosine pathway by ATIC inhibition. 5-MTHF: 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; 5,10-MTHF: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; ABC: ATP-binding cassette; ADORA: adenosine receptor; AICAR: 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; AMP: adenosine monophosphate; ATIC: 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; DHF: dihydrofolate; dTMP: deoxythymidine monophosphate; dUMP: deoxyuridine monophosphate; FAICAR: 5-formamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; IMP: inosine monophosphate; MTHFR: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTX: methotrexate; MTXPG: methotrexate polyglutamate; SLC: solute carrier; THF: tetrahydrofolate.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that the occurrence of variations on clinical response to MTX could be explained by genetic polymorphisms in* MTHFR* and* ATIC* genes [[11](#B11), [13](#B13)–[16](#B16), [24](#B24)–[28](#B28)]. The most studied polymorphism in* MTHFR *is C677T (rs1801133), which is responsible for a substitution of an alanine to a valine, leading to a thermolabile form of MTHFR with reduced activity [[29](#B29)]. In fact, it has been suggested that* MTHFR *677T allele is related to MTX nonresponse in RA [[13](#B13), [24](#B24)]. Similar to MTHFR, some authors have studied the role of the T675C (rs4673993) polymorphism in* ATIC*, of which the* ATIC* 675C allele has been associated with improved clinical* status* and, consequently, with clinical response to MTX [[14](#B14), [26](#B26)].\n\nThe pattern of MTX therapeutic outcome is considered to be a major factor for the motivation of researchers and clinicians to enroll patients in pharmacogenetic studies, mainly by comparative studies within different populations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the association of clinical response to MTX with* MTHFR* C677T and* ATIC* T675C polymorphisms, in Portuguese RA patients.\n\n## 2. Methods\n\n### 2.1. Characterization of the Studied Population\n\nThis study was developed as a retrospective study in a cohort of consecutive Caucasian patients (≥18 years) with RA treated with MTX for at least six months and was conducted between January 2009 and December 2012 at São João Hospital Center (Porto, Portugal). After diagnosis, patients were classified according to the 1987 criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and reclassified according to the 2010 criteria of ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [[30](#B30)]. All patients were initially treated with 10 mg* per os* (PO)/week of MTX in monotherapy. This dose was increased 5 mg at each three weeks if patients did not meet EULAR criteria for response, that is, if presenting a disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) > 3.2. At three months, if patients were still without response, the administration route was changed from PO to subcutaneous (SC) maintaining the MTX dose. If within three months, using SC at the maximum tolerable doses, patients did not meet the response criteria, MTX therapy was associated with other synthetic DMARDs. After three more months, if patients continued without response in two successive evaluations and did not present any contraindication, MTX therapy was discontinued or associated with biological DMARDs. The adjustment of MTX therapy also occurred when patients developed MTX-related toxicity. Due to the well-known protective effect of folic acid supplementation for the prevention of toxicity occurrence, in particular for gastrointestinal disorders [[31](#B31)–[33](#B33)], this drug was prescribed once a week to all patients and their regular compliance was registered.\n\nPatients were excluded from the study if not treated with MTX for at least six months and if there was history of drug abuse, recent pregnancy, or desire to become pregnant. The study procedures were considered according to the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration by the local Ethical Committee (reference 33/2009) and all patients provided a signed informed written consent.\n\n### 2.2. Data Collection and Variable Definition\n\nClinicopathological data were collected from individual clinical records by clinicians during patients' regular hospital visits and include variables possibly influencing disease state and clinical response to MTX, which were selected based on either the literature review and/or the clinical significance [[3](#B3), [5](#B5), [7](#B7), [16](#B16), [17](#B17), [33](#B33)]. These variables included (1) patient-related variables: age, gender, menopause, body mass index (BMI), smoking, number of pack years (NPY), and comorbidities; (2) disease-related variables: diagnosis age, duration, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), DAS28, and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ); and (3) treatment-related variables: symptomatic (corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), supplements (folic acid), other concomitant DMARDs, and MTX administration characteristics (dose, treatment duration, and administration route).\n\nNPY was calculated by the formula: (number of cigarettes smoked per day × number of years smoking)/20. Comorbidity was defined as the presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and/or cardiac disorders beyond RA. DAS28 was calculated as described by Prevoo et al. [[34](#B34)]. Daily corticosteroid therapy dose was considered in prednisolone equivalents.\n\nMTX clinical response was recorded at the time of each visit. Nonresponse was defined if patients presented a DAS28 > 3.2 in two consecutive evaluations despite the use of MTX either in monotherapy or combined with other DMARDs. Therefore, at least six months of MTX therapy was required to define which patients had nonresponse to MTX. Response to MTX was defined when patients presented a DAS28 ≤ 3.2.\n\n### 2.3. Sample Collection and Processing\n\nWhole blood samples were obtained with standard venipuncture technique using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing tubes and genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted with QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit according to the manufacturer instructions (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Total genomic DNA was quantified and its purity and integrity were analyzed using the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer v3.7 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).\n\n### 2.4. MTHFR C677T and ATIC T675C Genotyping\n\n*MTHFR *C677T and* ATIC* T675C polymorphisms were selected based on the role of MTHFR and ATIC in MTX action pathway, upon the putative alteration of these proteins levels and the consequent implication in MTX clinical response [[13](#B13), [14](#B14), [24](#B24), [26](#B26), [29](#B29)].\n\nGenotyping protocols were adjusted from those proposed by Sadananda Adiga et al. [[35](#B35)] for* MTHFR* C677T and Hinks et al. [[27](#B27)] for* ATIC* T675C.\n\n*MTHFR* C677T polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques. PCR amplification was performed for a final volume of 50 *μ*L containing 0.3 *μ*M of each primer (forward: 5′-TGA AGG AGA AGG TGT CTG CGG GA-3′; reverse: 5′-AGG ACG GTG CGG TGA GAG TG-3′), 1x DreamTaq Green master mix (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), and 50–100 ng of genomic DNA. The PCR conditions consisted of initial denaturation at 94°C during 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles with denaturation for 1 minute at 94°C, annealing for 1 minute at 57°C, extension for 15 seconds at 72°C, and a final extension at 72°C during 10 minutes. RFLP was performed at 37°C, overnight, using HinfI (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania). Individuals with the CC genotype presented 1 fragment with 198 base pairs (bp), whereas individuals with the TT genotype presented 1 fragment with 175 bp.\n\n*ATIC* T675C polymorphism was genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay (C_362264_10) from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) with fluorogenic binding probes. Reactions were performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with a 5 *μ*L final volume mixture containing 1x TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 900 nM of each primer, 200 nM of probes labeled with either FAM or VIC, and 10 ng of extracted DNA. Thermal cycling conditions were 10 minutes at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minute at 60°C. Allelic discrimination was performed by measuring endpoint fluorescence using ABI PRISM Sequence Detection System (Version 1.2.3, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\nFor quality control, 10% of the samples were randomly selected for a second analysis and 10% percent of cases were confirmed by automated sequencing in a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using the Kit BigDye Terminator v3.1 (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). Results were 100% concordant.\n\n### 2.5. Statistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), considering a statistically significant probability (*P*) value of 5% or less. The chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups (response* versus *nonresponse) and the different categorical variables. Odds ratio (OR) and the correspondent 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as a measure of the association between the categorical variables. For the comparison of quantitative variables two sample *t*-tests and nonparametric Mann-Whitney *U* tests were applied.\n\nMultivariate analysis with binary logistic regression was used to identify which genetic variables (*MTHFR *C677T and* ATIC *T675C genotypes) and clinicopathological variables could predict risk for occurrence of nonresponse to MTX. This analysis was performed adjusting to potential confounding variables in three steps: (1) patient-related variables; (2) patient- and disease-related variables; and (3) patient-, disease-, and treatment-related variables.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Characterization of the Studied Population\n\n[Table 1](#tab1) reports the clinicopathological variables of population enrolled in the study, that includes follow-up data from a total of 233 patients (196 females and 37 males), with a mean age of 52 ± 11.9 and disease duration of 8.0 (range: 0.5–53.0) years. Considering MTX therapy, the median treatment duration was 28.0 (range: 6.0–230.0) months with a median dose of 15.0 (range: 2.5–25.0) mg/week. Furthermore, 201 patients (86.3%) administered MTX by PO administration route and 32 (13.7%) by SC administration route. Nonresponse to MTX was observed in 128 (54.9%) patients and the mean for DAS28 was 4.2 ± 1.3.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Patient-related |   |\n| Male, n (%) | 37 (15.9) |\n| Female, n (%) | 196 (84.1) |\n| Postmenopausal, n (%) | 96 (49.0) |\n| Current smokers, n (%) | 32 (13.7) |\n| NPY*, median (IQR) | 19.5 (0.8–120.0) |\n| Comorbidity**, n (%) | 126 (54.1) |\n|   |  |\n| Disease-related |   |\n| Diagnosis age, mean ± SD, years | 40.3 ± 13.2 |\n| Disease duration, median (IQR), years | 8.0 (0.5–53.0) |\n| RF positive, n (%) | 131 (56.2) |\n| Anti-CCP positive, n (%) | 175 (75.1) |\n| ANAs positive, n (%) | 66 (28.3) |\n| DAS28, mean ± SD | 4.2 ± 1.3 |\n| Individual variables—DAS28 |   |\n| TJC (out of 28), median (IQR) | 4.0 (0.0–27.0) |\n| SJC (out of 28), median (IQR) | 3.0 (0.0–24.1) |\n| ESR, median (IQR), minutes (1st hour) | 18.0 (1.0–92.0) |\n| Global health on VAS, median (IQR) | 48.0 (0.0–100.0) |\n| HAQ score, median (IQR) | 1.25 (0.0–2.9) |\n| HAQ ≤ 0.5, n (%) | 39 (16.7) |\n|   |  |\n| Treatment-related § |   |\n| Symptomatic |   |\n| Corticosteroids, n (%) | 188 (80.7) |\n| Daily dose in prednisolone equivalents, median (IQR), mg | 5.0 (0.0–20.0) |\n| NSAIDs, n (%) | 170 (73.0) |\n| Supplements |   |\n| Folic acid#, n (%) | 118 (50.6) |\n| DMARDs |   |\n| Methotrexate monotherapy, n (%) | 146 (62.7) |\n| Combined methotrexate therapy—synthetic DMARDs, n (%) | 59 (25.3) |\n| Combined methotrexate therapy—biological DMARDs, n (%) | 28 (12.0) |\n| Methotrexate administration characteristics |   |\n| Dose, median (IQR), mg/week | 15.0 (2.5–25.0) |\n| Treatment duration, median (IQR), months | 28.0 (6.0–230.0) |\n| Per os administration route, n (%) | 201 (86.3) |\n| Subcutaneous administration route, n (%) | 32 (13.7) |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Clinicopathological variables of population enrolled in the study.\n\n### 3.2. Clinicopathological Variables and Clinical Response to MTX\n\n[Table 2](#tab2) represents the relation between clinicopathological variables and clinical response to MTX. In accordance with patient-related variables, our results showed that early age of diagnosis (*P* < 0.001) and noncurrent smokers (OR = 0.32; *P* = 0.004) were statistically significant associated with nonresponse to MTX. Concerning disease-related variables, our results demonstrated that positivity to anti-CCP (OR = 2.28; *P* = 0.007) and ANAs (OR = 1.98; *P* = 0.024) was statistically significant associated with nonresponse to MTX.

Considering the treatment-related variables, our results revealed that NSAIDs users (OR = 3.09; *P* < 0.001) were associated with nonresponse to MTX. In addition, attending to MTX administration characteristics, higher MTX doses (*P* < 0.001) were associated with nonresponse to MTX, while SC administration route (OR = 0.32; *P* = 0.004) was statistically significant associated with response to MTX.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Characteristic | Response (n = 105) | Nonresponse (n = 128) | P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Patient-related |   |   |   |\n| Male, n (%) | 19 (51.4) | 18 (48.6) | Reference |\n| Female, n (%) | 86 (43.9) | 110 (56.1) | 0.402 |\n| Premenopausal, n (%) | 39 (39.0) | 61 (61.0) | Reference |\n| Postmenopausal, n (%) | 47 (49.0) | 49 (51.0) | 0.160 |\n| Age, mean ± SD, years | 55.1 ± 11.6 | 49.3 ± 11.5 | <0.001 |\n| BMI, median (IQR), Kg/m2 | 26.2 (18.5–43.1) | 26.3 (18.4–38.9) | 0.574 |\n| Noncurrent smoker*, n (%) | 83 (41.3) | 118 (58.7) | Reference |\n| Current smoker, n (%) | 22 (68.8) | 10 (31.2) | 0.004a |\n| NPY**, median (IQR) | 20.1 (1.5–120.0) | 14.0 (0.8–40.0) | 0.269 |\n| Noncomorbidity, n (%) | 51 (47.7) | 56 (52.3) | Reference |\n| Comorbidity***, n (%) | 54 (42.9) | 72 (57.1) | 0.462 |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| Disease-related |   |   |   |\n| Diagnosis age, mean ± SD, years | 42.1 ± 13.3 | 39.1 ± 12.8 | 0.081 |\n| Disease duration, median (IQR), years | 8.0 (1.0–53.0) | 8.0 (0.5–38.0) | 0.164 |\n| RF negative, n (%) | 42 (41.2) | 60 (58.8) | Reference |\n| RF positive, n (%) | 63 (48.1) | 68 (51.9) | 0.293 |\n| Anti-CCP negative, n (%) | 35 (60.3) | 23 (39.7) | Reference |\n| Anti-CCP positive, n (%) | 70 (40.0) | 105 (60.0) | 0.007b |\n| ANAs negative, n (%) | 83 (49.7) | 84 (50.3) | Reference |\n| ANAs positive, n (%) | 22 (33.3) | 44 (66.7) | 0.024c |\n| DAS28, mean ± SD | 4.0 ± 1.5 | 4.3 ± 1.2 | 0.089 |\n| Individual variables—DAS28 |   |   |   |\n| TJC (out of 28), median (IQR) | 3.0 (0.0–27.0) | 5.0 (0.0–20.0) | 0.007 |\n| SJC (out of 28), median (IQR) | 2.0 (0.0–24.0) | 4.0 (0.0–23.0) | 0.008 |\n| ESR, median (IQR), minutes (1st hour) | 19.0 (1.0–88.0) | 17.0 (1.0–92.0) | 0.509 |\n| Global health on VAS, median (IQR) | 47.0 (0.0–100.0) | 49.0 (0.0–100.0) | 0.516 |\n| HAQ score, median (IQR) | 1.1 (0.0–2.9) | 1.5 (0.0–2.6) | 0.006 |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| Treatment-related § |   |   |   |\n| Symptomatic |   |   |   |\n| Noncorticosteroids, n (%) | 21 (46.7) | 24 (53.3) | Reference |\n| Corticosteroids, n (%) | 84 (44.7) | 104 (55.3) | 0.810 |\n| Non-NSAIDs, n (%) | 41 (65.1) | 22 (34.9) | Reference |\n| NSAIDs, n (%) | 64 (37.6) | 106 (62.4) | <0.001d |\n| Supplements |   |   |   |\n| Folic acid nonregular users, n (%) | 52 (45.2) | 63 (54.8) | Reference |\n| Folic acid regular users, n (%) | 53 (44.9) | 65 (55.1) | 0.963 |\n| Methotrexate administration characteristics |   |   |   |\n| Dose, median (IQR), mg/week | 15.0 (2.5–25.0) | 20.0 (7.5–25.0) | <0.001 |\n| Treatment duration, median (IQR), months | 28.0 (6.0–230.0) | 29.0 (6.0–209.0) | 0.204 |\n| Per os administration route, n (%) | 83 (41.3) | 118 (58.7) | Reference |\n| Subcutaneous administration route, n (%) | 22 (68.8) | 10 (31.2) | 0.004e |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Relation between clinicopathological variables and clinical response to methotrexate.\n\n### 3.3.

In our population, the minor allele for* MTHFR* C677T was T and for* ATIC* T675C was C (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials available online at [http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/368681](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/368681)).

Multivariate Analysis and Clinical Response to MTX\n\nMultivariate analysis with binary logistic regression was used to identify which clinicopathological and genetic variables (*MTHFR* C677T and* ATIC* T675C genotypes) could predict risk for the occurrence of nonresponse to MTX ([Table 4](#tab4)). This analysis was performed in three steps adjusting to potential confounding variables. In the first step, patient-related variables were considered and our results demonstrated that* MTHFR* 677TT (OR = 2.64; *P* = 0.040) and* ATIC* 675T carriers (OR = 3.20; *P* = 0.022) were associated with about 3-fold increased risk for nonresponse to MTX. In a second step, beyond patient-related variables, disease-related variables were added and results confirmed that* MTHFR* 677TT (OR = 3.23; *P* = 0.025) and* ATIC* 675T carriers (OR = 4.63; *P* = 0.007) were associated with nonresponse to MTX. In a third step, beyond patient- and disease-related variables, treatment-related variables were added and the obtained results showed that* MTHFR* 677TT carriers (OR = 4.63; *P* = 0.013) were statistically significant associated with more than 4-fold increased risk for nonresponse to MTX when compared to* MTHFR* 677C carriers. Additionally,* ATIC* 675T carriers (OR = 5.16; *P* = 0.013) were statistically significant associated with more than 5-fold increased risk for nonresponse to MTX when compared to* ATIC* 675CC.\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Genetic variables | Adjusted variables |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Patient-related |  | Patient-related + disease-related |  | Patient-related + disease-related + treatment-related |  |  |\n|   | P value | OR (95% CI) | P value | OR (95% CI) | P value | OR (95% CI) |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| MTHFR C677T, rs1801133 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| C carriers |   | Reference |   | Reference |   | Reference |\n| TT | 0.040 | 2.64 (1.04–6.67) | 0.025 | 3.23 (1.16–9.02) | 0.013 | 4.63 (1.37–15.60) |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ATIC T675C, rs4673993 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| CC |   | Reference |   | Reference |   | Reference |\n| T carriers | 0.022 | 3.20 (1.18–8.66) | 0.007 | 4.63 (1.51–14.12) | 0.013 | 5.16 (1.42–18.76) |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Multivariate logistic regression analysis and clinical response to methotrexate.\n\nFurthermore, considering clinicopathological variables, we observed that noncurrent smokers (OR = 7.98; *P* = 0.001), positivity to anti-CCP (OR = 3.53; *P* = 0.004) and ANAs (OR = 2.28; *P* = 0.045), higher HAQ (OR = 2.42; *P* = 0.007), and NSAIDs users (OR = 2.77; *P* = 0.018) were statistically significant associated with nonresponse to MTX. Moreover, SC administration route (OR = 0.11; *P* < 0.001) was statistically significant associated with response to MTX.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nDespite the fact that MTX is extensively used in RA treatment, the individual clinical response to MTX is variable and, therefore, additional DMARDs are often required to achieve a low disease activity profile or even remission [[2](#B2)].\n\nPrevious studies revealed controversial results when clinicopathological variables were associated with* MTHFR* C677T and* ATIC* T675C polymorphisms for clinical response to MTX. Several explanations can be proposed for such observed discrepancies, such as bias related to study design and settings, sample size/power, ethnicity, the population disease duration (early or established RA), changes in folate* status*, influence of less common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in* MTHFR* and* ATIC*, polymorphisms in genes encoding to other intervenient proteins in folate, purine, pyrimidine, adenosine, and methionine pathways, and also differences in the definition of MTX clinical response [[28](#B28)].\n\nBesides the potential importance of our results, we are aware of possible limitations, especially the sample size. Despite this, patient characteristics are similar to those reported in the literature [[36](#B36), [37](#B37)]. Our case series is a representative clinical practice cohort of established and well-defined RA patients [[25](#B25), [38](#B38)] and the genotypes distribution of* MTHFR* C677T and* ATIC* T675C polymorphisms is in accordance with the published literature for other Caucasian population [[13](#B13), [14](#B14), [24](#B24)–[26](#B26), [39](#B39)].\n\n### 4.1. MTHFR C677T and ATIC T675C and Clinical Response to MTX\n\nRegarding* MTHFR *C677T polymorphism, our results demonstrated a statistically significant association between* MTHFR *677TT and nonresponse to MTX, which is in accordance with previously reported studies [[13](#B13), [24](#B24)]. Although MTHFR is not directly inhibited by MTX or MTXPG, its expression levels may play an important role in MTX overall effect by modifying the folate* status *of the cell [[16](#B16)]. Literature describes* MTHFR *677TT as responsible for a reduction of MTHFR activity [[29](#B29)], leading to reduced 5-MTHF and other folate cofactors levels and, consequently, to decreased adenosine release [[22](#B22), [23](#B23), [40](#B40)], which can partially explain MTX nonresponse.\n\nRegarding* ATIC *T675C polymorphism, our results indicate that* ATIC *675T carriers presented an increased risk for nonresponse to MTX, as previously reported [[14](#B14), [26](#B26)]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no functional studies reporting the effect of this polymorphism in ATIC activity. Nevertheless, it can be hypothesized that the presence of* ATIC *675T allele will lead to MTX nonresponse due to the increased conversion of AICAR to FAICAR ([Figure 1](#fig1)), causing adenosine degradation and its nonrelease, hindering MTX anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally,* ATIC *675T allele seems to contribute to the decrease of MTX antiproliferative effect [[41](#B41)]. Moreover, this polymorphism seems to be in linkage disequilibrium with* ATIC* C347G (rs2372536), of which* ATIC* 347G carriers (minor allele) have been reported as related to better response [[16](#B16), [26](#B26), [42](#B42), [43](#B43)]. Hence, results are consistent with ours reporting an association between* ATIC *675CC (minor allele) and clinical response to MTX.\n\n### 4.2. Clinicopathological Variables and Clinical Response to MTX\n\nAccording to patient-related variables, multivariate analysis results demonstrated that noncurrent smokers were associated with nonresponse to MTX. Literature describes the association between smoking and decreased folate levels which, in fact, enhance the antifolate effect of MTX and, therefore, improve clinical response to MTX [[44](#B44)–[46](#B46)]. Furthermore, cigarette nicotine seems to potentiate the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects by acting on the immunological system [[47](#B47), [48](#B48)]. Although some studies have demonstrated that smokers had worst response to MTX, presenting a higher disease activity and severity [[6](#B6), [49](#B49)], others were able to demonstrate that tobacco exposure reduced radiographic progression and favored a better functional score [[50](#B50), [51](#B51)]. Considering disease-related variables, our results demonstrated an association of more than 2-fold higher risk between anti-CCP and ANAs positivity and nonresponse to MTX. Anti-CCP and ANAs are autoantibodies found in RA that are strongly correlated with erosive disease, worse functional* status,* and higher disease activity [[1](#B1), [9](#B9), [52](#B52)–[55](#B55)] associated with nonresponse. Other studies have shown a relation between anti-CCP positivity and MTX response or presented no associations in early RA patients [[56](#B56), [57](#B57)]; nevertheless, our results may be explained by the fact that our series was constituted mainly by patients with established disease. To the best of our knowledge there are no studies in RA associating ANAs and MTX response. Additionally, higher HAQ was associated with more than 2-fold increased risk for nonresponse to MTX. Since higher HAQ score represents an increased disease activity it was expected, as reported by others, that these patients have worst response [[56](#B56), [58](#B58)]. In accordance with treatment-related variables, the concomitant use of NSAIDs was correlated with nonresponse to MTX. These results could be explained by the existence of drug-drug interactions since NSAIDs are known to alter MTX and 7-hydroxymethotrexate binding to plasmatic proteins and to impair MTX hepatic metabolism [[41](#B41)]. This translates into low amount of free MTX and lesser formation of active MTX metabolites in hepatocytes. Due to the importance of NSAIDs as symptomatic therapy in RA and due to contradictory results reported, further studies are required to clarify this association [[56](#B56), [59](#B59)]. In addition, SC administration route was statistically significant associated with MTX response. This result can be explained by the higher MTX bioavailability associated with SC administration route [[60](#B60)]. Consequently, this will lead to a greater tissues exposure to MTX, higher cellular polyglutamation and retention, and better response to MTX.\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nOur results suggested that noncurrent smoking, anti-CCP and ANAs positivity, higher HAQ, NSAIDs utilization, PO administration route, T homozygosity for* MTHFR* C677T, and T allele carrying for* ATIC* T675C can be possible predictive factors of nonresponse to MTX. Thus, the inclusion of these polymorphisms in combination with clinicopathological variables may add valuable information that may help to identify patients who will benefit from MTX treatment and assist clinicians to make better treatment decisions. Despite the potential of these findings, translation into clinical practice requires larger and multicentric studies in order to clearly endorse the importance of these polymorphisms.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge* Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia* (FCT) for the Doctoral Grant (SFRH/BD/64441/2009), Aurea Lima, the nursing service of Rheumatology Day Hospital of São João Hospital Center, and the clinicians from the Rheumatology Department of São João Hospital Center, especially Lucia Costa (M.D.) and Francisco Ventura (M.D., Ph.D.).\n\n## Conflict of Interests\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n## References\n\n1.

Herein, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of 434 patients with newly diagnosed ALL and surveyed 500,568 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\n\n### Patients and Treatment\n\nThe discovery cohort included 434 children (median age, 5.92 years; range, 1.02 to 18.85 years) with ALL enrolled and treated on St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Total XIIIB and Total XV protocols (Data Supplement Table 1).^26–28^ The validation cohort consisted of the next set of 206 patients (median age, 5.10 years; range 1.17 to 18.67 years) treated on St. Jude's Total XV protocol (Data Supplement Table 1) who were enrolled after the initial analysis began. Total XIIIB included consolidation therapy of two weekly doses of methotrexate (2 g/m^2^ over 2 hours, followed by leucovorin) and 6-mercaptopurine (75 mg/m^2^ per night for 2 weeks).^26,27^ Subsequent therapy included identical methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine doses administered every 8 weeks up to 1 year. Total XV included four doses of methotrexate during consolidation, each given over 24 hours with dosage adjusted to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration of 33 μmol/L (low-risk arm) or 65 μmol/L (standard/high-risk arm).^28^ Serum creatinine was measured in the 24 hours before methotrexate treatment. Parents and patients gave informed consent and assent as appropriate, and the study was approved by the institutional review board. All grade 3 and 4 toxicities were prospectively scored using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) ([http://ctep.cancer.gov](http://ctep.cancer.gov)) toxicity criteria during the consolidation and continuation periods.^26^ The most common toxicities during consolidation, when only methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine were given, were GI (mucositis) and infection. Detailed procedures for methotrexate administration (Data Supplement Table 2) and evaluations are provided in the Data Supplement.\n\n### Pharmacokinetic Data\n\nClearance was estimated on the basis of three to four methotrexate plasma concentrations per course up to 48 hours from the start of infusion. Clearance was estimated (CL = k_e_ × V) using a two-compartmental linear pharmacokinetic model and a Bayesian approach, via ADAPT software (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), as described.^26,29,30^ Population priors, mean (variance), were 9.0 L/m^2^ (22.1) for V_c_, 0.70 hours^−1^ (0.05) for K_e_, 0.08 hours^−1^ (0.002) for K_cp_, and 0.11 hours^−1^ (0.000014) for K_pc_ as described.^30^ The average methotrexate clearance per patient across courses was calculated using all available postremission courses.\n\n### Genotyping and SNP Filtering Criteria\n\nGermline DNA was extracted from blood after remission was achieved. DNA (500 ng) was applied to the 500K Array Set (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Chips were scanned and genotype calls were made using the Bayesian Robust Linear Multichip with Mahalanobis Distance (BRLMM) algorithm for 500,568 interrogated SNPs. Initial missing SNP genotypes were imputed using the fastPHASE software (Data Supplement; University of Washington, Seattle).^31^ SNPs were excluded for genotyping call rates less than 95% (n = 29,314), minor allele frequency less than 1% (n = 63,110), or if allele frequencies deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (n = 10,944; *P* < 1 × 10^−7^). Some SNPs were excluded that met more than one criterion, leaving 398,699 SNPs in the analysis.\n\nFor a subset of patients in the validation cohort (n = 103), SNP genotypes were obtained using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix). The nonsynonymous SNP, *SLCO1B1* T521C (rs4149056) was not represented on the Affymetrix arrays and was independently genotyped (DNAPrint Genomics, Sarasota, FL); call rates were more than 97% for this SNP.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nAnalyses were conducted using R ([http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)) and SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Associations between average methotrexate clearance and patient characteristics (sex, age, race, and treatment regimen) were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Nongenetic factors (eg, hydration and alkalinization) were standardized for each treatment regimen (Data Supplement). Associations between germline SNP genotypes and methotrexate clearance were evaluated using a general linear model, treating genotype as a numerical variable (0 = AA, 1 = AB, and 2 = BB) and including age, race, sex, and treatment regimen as covariates. Age was coded in years and treated as a continuous variable. Treatment regimen was coded as a categoric variable, and Total XIIIB was considered the baseline covariate in the multivariate analysis. Ancestry was determined using the actual genotypes, computing each patient's probability of having European, African, or Asian ancestry (Data Supplement). Ancestry was alternatively characterized using Eigenstrat software (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) on the basis of a principal component analysis of SNP genotypes.^32^ We found good concordance (94%) between genomically determined ancestry and self-declared race. SNPs whose *P* value for association with methotrexate clearance was less than 1 × 10^−7^ were considered reaching genome-wide significance. Because only SNPs annotated to the *SLCO1B1* gene were tested for association with methotrexate clearance in the validation cohorts, a *P* value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate percent variation explained by genotypes and other covariates.\n\nA genome-wide linear mixed effect model^33^ was also conducted with each individual course of methotrexate clearance as a dependent variable, including course number (course 1 to 10 for patients on Total XIIIB and course 1 to 4 for patients on Total XV) and serum creatinine for each course as covariates. A linear mixed effect model was also used to estimate the intra- and interpatient variability in methotrexate clearance in the discovery cohort.\n\nLogistic regression was used to analyze whether *SLCO1B1* genotypes were associated with toxicity (GI toxicity and infection) as a dichotomous variable (yes or no) during consolidation. Patients with grade 3 or 4 toxicities (mucositis or infection) were considered as having toxicity. Weighted logistic regression^26^ was used to analyze the genotype-toxicity association in the 120-week continuation phase of therapy for Total XIIIB, accounting for recurrent episodes and censoring. The cumulative incidences of GI toxicity were compared among genotypes using Gray's test with incorporation of competing risks.^34^ To compute the odds ratio estimated for toxicity during the consolidation phase of therapy, we added a continuity adjustment of 0.5 to each cell count to deal with the zero event count for those with common homozygous genotypes.\n\nFor the gene level analysis, 24,836 genes were annotated to the interrogated SNPs, including all SNPs located within 5,000 base pairs (ie, *cis*-SNPs) of each transcript. We tested for significant associations between all the SNP genotypes (per gene) and methotrexate clearance using multiple linear regression, and we assessed the percent variation explained by the genotypes using *r*^2^ test statistic, the Akaike information criterion, and permutation analyses (Data Supplement).\n\n## RESULTS\n\nIn the discovery cohort, we estimated methotrexate clearance for 3,014 treatment courses given to 434 patients (Data Supplement Table 1). There was substantial interpatient variability in average (± standard deviation) methotrexate clearance ([Fig 1](#F1)), which differed among the 213 patients on the Total XIIIB (133 ± 25 mL/min/m^2^), the 114 patients on the Total XV low-risk (123 ± 28 mL/min/m^2^), and the 107 patients on the Total XV standard/high-risk (106 ± 22 mL/min/m^2^) treatment regimens (Data Supplement Fig 1; *P* < 2.2 × 10^−16^). The variability observed between treatment regimens is not surprising, given that dosage and the concomitant hydration and alkalinization (factors that can affect methotrexate clearance) differed (Data Supplement Table 2).^22^ Average methotrexate clearance differed by ancestral group (Data Supplement Fig 2; *P* = .005) with African American patients having the highest clearance. As previously noted,^19,22^ methotrexate clearance decreased with increasing age (Data Supplement Fig 3; *P* = 1.1 × 10^-6^). Thus, we adjusted all analyses for age, race, sex, and treatment regimen. Using a linear mixed effect model, the intrapatient variability in methotrexate clearance was 48%, while the interpatient variability was 52%.\n\n### Fig 1.\n\n![Fig 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6a1e/2793040/00b983d6353e/zlj9990990890001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2793040_zlj9990990890001.jpg)\n\nAverage methotrexate clearance and linkage disequilibrium structure of the SLCO1B1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 434 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Patients homozygous for the major allele are coded in blue, heterozygotes are coded in green, and those homozygous for the minor allele are coded in yellow.\n\nWe tested the association between 398,699 SNPs and average methotrexate clearance in 434 children in the discovery cohort. The strongest association signal was on chromosome 12 ([Fig 2](#F2)). The two top SNPs associated with methotrexate clearance were annotated to the transporter gene, *SLCO1B1*/OATP1B1, located on chromosome 12 ([Table 1](#T1); Data Supplement Tables 3-5). These two *SLCO1B1* SNPs remained significant (rs11045879, *P* = 1.7 × 10^−10^ and rs4149081, *P* = 1.7 × 10^−9^) even after correction for multiple testing. These two *SLCO1B1* SNPs were in complete LD (*r*^2^ = 1) with each other ([Fig 1](#F1)) and were associated with methotrexate clearance across regimens ([Fig 3](#F3)).\n\n### Fig 2.\n\n![Fig 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6a1e/2793040/3ab05562d6bf/zlj9990990890002.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2793040_zlj9990990890002.jpg)\n\nGenome-wide P values showing the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with methotrexate clearance in the discovery cohort of 434 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

(A) Association of SLCO1B1 SNP genotype (rs11045879) with methotrexate clearance in patients on Total XIIIB (TXIIIB), Total XV low-risk (TXVL), and Total XV standard/high-risk (TXVSH) treatment regimens. Numbers below each box plot indicate the sample size for each genotype. (B) Association of this SNP with GI toxicity. Logistic regression was used to analyze whether genotypes for SLCO1B1 SNPs were associated with toxicity as a dichotomous variable (yes or no) during the 2-week consolidation phase. The bar graphs display the percentage of patients (plotted on the y axis) per genotype (plotted on the x axis) who had grade 3 to 4 GI toxicity. Numbers above each bar represent the number of patients who had toxicity versus those who did not for the specified genotype. Similar relationships exist for SLCO1B1 SNP rs4149081 (data not shown).\n\nWe also used a linear mixed effects model to identify associations between SNP genotypes and methotrexate clearance; the results were similar to those assessing average clearance, with the same two top-ranked SNPs (*P* < 6.8 × 10^−9^) in *SLCO1B1* (Data Supplement Table 4). Only 6.0% of the intracourse variability in clearance was accounted for by course number, even when accounting for the premethotrexate serum creatinine (Data Supplement Table 6).\n\nEight additional *SLCO1B1* SNPs ([Table 1](#T1)) were associated with clearance (*P* < .05); these SNPs were not in LD (based on *r*^2^) with the top two *SLCO1B1* SNPs ([Fig 1](#F1)) and were encompassed by multiple haplotype blocks (Data Supplement Figs 4A and [4](#F4)B). In a gene-level analysis, *SLCO1B1* had a stronger association with methotrexate clearance (*P* < 1 × 10^−6^), with a higher *r*^2^ and a lower Akaike information criterion, than any other gene (Data Supplement Tables 7 and 11).\n\n### Fig 4.\n\n![Fig 4.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6a1e/2793040/f437a2114b35/zlj9990990890004.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2793040_zlj9990990890004.jpg)\n\nIncidence of toxicity based on SLCO1B1 rs11045879 genotype. Cumulative incidence of the first episode of GI toxicity significantly differed (P = .024) by SLCO1B1 rs11045879 genotype during the continuation phase of treatment during the Total XIIIB treatment regimen. Cumulative incidences of GI toxicity were compared among genotypes using Gray's test with incorporation of competing risks.\n\nWe genotyped a validation cohort of 206 additional patients ([Table 1](#T1)). Seven of the 10 interrogated *SLCO1B1* SNPs remained associated (*P* < .05) with methotrexate clearance ([Table 1](#T1)). Nine of the 10 *SLCO1B1* SNPs were associated with clearance (*P* < .05) when the two cohorts (discovery and validation) were combined ([Table 1](#T1)), and the strongest signal remained in *SLCO1B1* (Data Supplement Fig 5).\n\nThe percentage of methotrexate clearance variability that could be explained by *SLCO1B1* genotypes compared with the variability explained by factors such as race, sex, age, treatment regimen, or serum creatinine was estimated in a multivariate analysis for both the discovery and validation cohorts ([Table 2](#T2)). In a stepwise linear regression analysis, five SNPs were retained in the model ([Table 2](#T2)), such that *SLCO1B1* genetic variation accounted for 9.3% of the interpatient variability in the discovery cohort and 11.3% in the validation cohort. This superseded the proportion of variability contributed by the significant factors of race, serum creatinine, and sex; only treatment regimen accounted for a higher proportion (17.9%) of the variation in clearance ([Table 2](#T2)). Average serum creatinine concentrations explained 3.2% and 1.9% of the variability in methotrexate clearance in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively; in a linear mixed effects model (Data Supplement Table 6), 2.4% of interpatient and 0.4% of intrapatient variability was accounted for by serum creatinine. Treatment regimen and *SLCO1B1* SNP genotypes accounted for 18.6% and 11.0% of variability in clearance, respectively. Results were similar for the first cycle only of methotrexate (Data Supplement Table 8).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Variables | Discovery Cohort (n = 434) |  |  |  | Validation Cohort With Serum Creatinine Data*(n = 125) |  |  |  | Validation Cohort† (n = 206) |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Coefficient‡ | 95% CI | P§ | r2 (%) | Coefficient‡ | 95% CI | P§ | r2 (%) | Coefficient‡ | 95% CI | P§ | r2 (%) |  |\n| Ancestry¶ |   |   | .0007 | 2.1 |   |   | .32 | 1.6 |   |   | .021 | 4.1 |\n| African | Ref‡ |   |   |   | Ref‡ |   |   |   | Ref‡ |   |   |   |\n| European | −13.0 | −19.8 to −6.3 |   |   | −7.9 | −18.5 to 2.8 |   |   | −7.3 | −16.7 to 2.0 |   |   |\n| Asian | −6.5 | −25.0 to 12.0 |   |   | 2.4 | −31.8 to 36.6 |   |   | 14.6 | −4.3 to 33.6 |   |   |\n| Sex |   |   | .003 | 0.01 |   |   | .02 | 3.3 |   |   | .046 | 1.1 |\n| Female | Ref‡ |   |   |   | Ref‡ |   |   |   | Ref‡ |   |   |   |\n| Male | 6.6 | 2.2 to 10.9 |   |   | 7.7 | 1.1 to 14.3 |   |   | 5.6 | 0.2 to 11.0 |   |   |\n| Serum creatinine, mg/dL‖ | −60.2 | −86.8 to −33.7 | 8.6 × 10−6 | 3.2 | −33.6 | −71.8 to 4.6 | .09 | 1.9 | NA |   | NA | NA |\n| Age, years | 0.39 | −0.49 to 1.3 | .39 | 0.1 | 0.98 | −0.21 to 2.2 | .10 | 1.7 | −0.5 | −1.1 to 0.1 | .093 | 1.7 |\n| Treatment regimen |   |   | 1.1 × 10−25 | 17.9 |   |   | .00013 | 9.3 |   |   | .001 | 2.8 |\n| Total XV low-risk | Ref‡ |   |   |   | Ref‡ |   |   |   | Ref‡ |   |   |   |\n| Total XV standard/high-risk | −15.9 | −22.1 to −9.7 |   |   | −15.0 | −22.8 to −7.3 |   |   | −7.2 | −13.1 to −1.4 |   |   |\n| Total XIIIB | 14.3 | 8.7 to 19.8 |   |   | NA |   |   |   | NA |   |   |   |\n| SLCO1B1 genotype# |   |   | 2.3 × 10−10 | 9.3 |   |   | .002 | 11.3 |   |   | 4.7 × 10−4 | 9.3 |\n| rs4149081 (A/G) | 14.0 | 8.5 to 19.5 |   |   | 5.2 | −3.3 to 13.8 |   |   | 6.6 | 0 to 13.2 |   |   |\n| rs10841753 (C/T) | −7.2 | −13.6 to −0.8 |   |   | 0.07 | −12.1 to 12.3 |   |   | 1.3 | −6.8 to 9.4 |   |   |\n| rs11045818 (A/G) | −8.3 | −19.4 to −2.9 |   |   | −18.6 | −34.7 to −2.4 |   |   | −17.8 | −29.7 to −5.8 |   |   |\n| rs2900476 (C/T) | 3.4 | −1.6 to 8.4 |   |   | 3.4 | −4.2 to 11.0 |   |   | 2.9 | −3.1 to 8.9 |   |   |\n| rs17328763 (C/T) | −8.4 | −18.5 to 1.6 |   |   | −6.0 | −17.4 to 5.3 |   |   | −6.2 | −14.7 to 2.1 |   |   |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Multivariate Analysis of Factors Associated With Average Methotrexate Clearance in the Discovery and Validation Cohorts\n\nGI toxicity (grade 3 or 4 mucositis) and infection were the most common toxicities observed during the methotrexate-intensive consolidation and continuation phases of Total XIIIB therapy.^26^ SNPs in *SLCO1B1*, rs11045879 T allele (OR, 16.4; 95% CI, 8.7 to 26.7; *P* = .004) and the G allele at rs4149081 (OR, 15.3; 95% CI, 7.9 to 24.6; *P* = .03; data not shown) were each associated with GI toxicity during consolidation ([Fig 3](#F3)). The same two SNPs were also associated with GI toxicity during the continuation phase ([Fig 4](#F4)). During the consolidation phase of Total XV, GI toxicity was less frequent (5% *v* 18% in Total XIIIB), and we found no association with *SLCO1B1* SNP genotypes. Because all patients on Total XV had their methotrexate doses adjusted to achieve a common steady-state plasma concentration, relationships among toxicity and methotrexate exposure and *SLCO1B1* SNPs may have been attenuated on this trial. We found no associations between *SLCO1B1* SNP genotype and infectious toxicity in either trial (data not shown).\n\nWe also genotyped the nonsynonymous *SLCO1B1* T521C (rs4149056) polymorphism in a subset of 489 patients; this subset included 387 patients from the discovery cohort and 102 patients from the validation cohort (Data Supplement Table 1). *SLCO1B1* T521C was in high LD with the top *SLCO1B1* SNPs rs11045879 (*r*^2^ = 0.86, discovery cohort; *r*^2^ = 0.89, validation cohort) and rs4149081 (*r*^2^ = 0.86, discovery cohort; *r*^2^ = 0.89, validation cohort). *SLCO1B1* T521C was associated with methotrexate clearance in the discovery and the combined (discovery plus validation) patient cohorts (Data Supplement Table 9; *P* = 1.9 × 10^−7^ and *P* = 1.2 × 10^−7^, respectively). In addition, a marginal association (*P* = .07) was observed between this SNP genotype and the occurrence of GI toxicity during consolidation (Data Supplement Fig 6). In multivariate analysis, the T521C SNP was significantly associated with methotrexate clearance; however, when genotypes at T521C and at rs11045879 were allowed to compete, only the rs11045879 SNP remained in the model (Data Supplement Table 10).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nUsing a genome-wide interrogation of germline variation, we uncovered genetic variation that affects the disposition and effects of methotrexate in children with ALL. The strongest genetic variation associated with methotrexate pharmacokinetics and dynamics resided in a reasonable candidate gene, *SLCO1B1*, although this transporter was not previously studied as a candidate gene in clinical pharmacogenetic studies of methotrexate.^35–38^\n\nThe *SLCO1B1* locus maintained significance after adjusting for covariates such as age, race, serum creatinine, sex, and treatment regimen and was verified in an independent validation set. The top-ranked SNPs (Data Supplement Tables 3-5), rs11045879 and rs4149081, were located in the gene (*SLCO1B1*) encoding an organic anion transporter (OATP1B1). Eight additional SNPs in *SLCO1B1* had *P* values less than .05 for their association with methotrexate clearance ([Table 1](#T1)). The fact that multiple SNPs in this locus, some of which were not in LD, were independently associated with methotrexate clearance provides further evidence of the functional importance of *SLCO1B1*.\n\n*SLCO1B1* is localized at the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes, and its transcript has been detected in enterocytes.^39–41^ *SLCO1B1* mediates uptake of substrates from sinusoidal blood, resulting in their net excretion from blood (likely via biliary excretion). *SLCO1B1* has been shown to transport methotrexate in vitro,^42,43^ as well as other compounds such as bilirubin, bile acids, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors,^44,45^ benzylpenicillin, rifampicin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38.^46,47^\n\nPrevious studies have described functional consequences of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in *SLCO1B1* in vitro^43,48^ and in vivo (eg, statins).^49^ The *SLCO1B1* T521C SNP was in high LD (*r*^2^ = 0.84) with the SNPs interrogated on the genome-wide arrays we used, and our independent genotyping confirmed an association of lower methotrexate clearance (higher systemic exposure) with the C allele. This is consistent with prior studies that demonstrate greater plasma exposure to multiple *SLCO1B1* substrates in those carrying the 521C allele than those homozygous for the 521T allele.^49–51^ Nonetheless, most of the *SLCO1B1* SNPs that were associated with clearance ([Table 1](#T1)) were noncoding SNPs, not in LD with T521C, and in a multivariate model, SNPs other than T521C maintained an association with methotrexate clearance (Data Supplement Table 10). The fact that these SNPs resided throughout the gene suggest multiple mechanisms by which variations affect the function of *SLCO1B1*, perhaps by effects on transcription and post-transcriptional processing (eg, pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA translation). Moreover, noncoding SNPs may be in linkage with rare, nontyped coding SNPs. Thus it appears that the function of *SLCO1B1* may be affected by several different polymorphisms.\n\nSNPs in *SLCO1B1* were associated not only with methotrexate clearance but also with GI toxicity ([Fig 3](#F3)) in Total XIIIB. Only 5% of patients in Total XV had toxicity, and this may in part be attributed to targeting of methotrexate to achieve a specific plasma concentration. The alleles that were associated with lower plasma exposure were always associated with increased GI toxicity. This finding is consistent with lower blood concentrations but higher GI tract or enterocyte concentrations of methotrexate being associated with GI toxicity. The fact that *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms were not associated with the other common toxicity,^26^ infection, is consistent with GI concentrations being a determinant of methotrexate GI toxicity^52,53^ and being of relatively minor importance for infectious toxicity. Because 6-mercaptopurine was given during consolidation, toxicity (particularly infection) may have been partly due to 6-mercaptopurine. However, GI toxicity is more closely linked to methotrexate^53^ than to thiopurines.^54,55^\n\n*SLCO1B1* genotypes were associated with methotrexate clearance across three different treatment regimens ([Fig 3](#F3)) and were significant after adjusting for regimen differences and for sex, race, renal function, and age ([Table 2](#T2) and Data Supplement Table 6). Moreover, clearance was measured on multiple occasions, and thus the average value of clearance is a composite that already accounts for intrapatient variability that may have been due to nongenetic causes. Accounting for each course independently in a mixed effects model, and accounting for variation in serum creatinine,^56^ polymorphisms in *SLCO1B1* remained significant predictors of interpatient variability in clearance. The fact that serum creatinine explained a small fraction (2.4%) of the interpatient variability in methotrexate clearance may be because serum creatinine was monitored before administration of the drug, and renal dysfunction was a contraindication to high-dose methotrexate. The proportion (9.3%) of interpatient variability in drug clearance attributable to germline variation in a single gene is on par with or greater than the variability accounted for by a single gene for other complex phenotypes.^57^\n\nIdentifying patients at risk of low methotrexate clearance could be useful for monitoring and supportive care during high-dose methotrexate, particularly in settings in which rapid turnaround of plasma levels is not available. Moreover, identifying that *SLCO1B1* accounts for a substantial degree of interpatient variability in clearance highlights that drug interactions are likely to occur if a potent *SLCO1B1* substrate is given with methotrexate.\n\nMethotrexate is metabolized to a 7-OH methotrexate metabolite.^58^ This metabolite could interact with *SLCO1B1*. Other genetic variations may influence methotrexate clearance, such as in *SLCO1A2* (Data Supplement Tables 3-5).^59^ Moreover, there may be important insertion/deletion or germline copy number variations that were not adequately interrogated on the array we used.\n\nUsing a whole-genome approach, we identified a plausible candidate gene, *SLCO1B1*, that is associated with methotrexate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This illustrates the proof of principle that genome-wide tools can lead to the discovery of important pharmacogenetic links between inherited genomic variation and drug response in humans.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nWe thank our protocol coinvestigators, clinical and research staff, particularly Pamela McGill, Natalie Lowery, Sean Freeman, Nancy Kornegay, and Jennifer Pauley, PharmD, as well as patients and families for their participation.

Since endocannabinoid signaling and dopamine neurotransmission have been shown to be involved with drug reward, genes related to these systems are plausible candidates for susceptibility to cocaine dependence. The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) protein regulates both the endocannabinoid and dopaminergic neurobiological systems, and polymorphisms in the cannabinoid receptor gene, CNR1, have been previously been associated with substance dependence. In this study, we attempt to replicate a finding associating CNR1 with cocaine dependence in African Americans. Cocaine dependent individuals (n=883) and unaffected controls (n=334) of African descent were genotyped for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CB1 gene (rs6454674, rs806368). We observed a significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases and controls for both SNPs (p≤0.05). This study confirms the association between variants in the CNR1 and cocaine dependence. However, considering the substantial co-morbidity of cocaine dependence with other drugs of abuse, additional studies are necessary to determine whether polymorphisms in CNR1 induce a general susceptibility to substance dependence or are specific to cocaine addiction.\n\nKeywords: Addiction, Association study, Cocaine, Cannabinoid receptor, Genetics, Substance abuse\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that nearly 6 million Americans age 12 years and above used cocaine during the year prior to the survey, making cocaine one of the most commonly used illicit drugs in the United States ([Nsdhu, 2003](#R26)). Repeated exposure to cocaine can lead to the rapid escalation of compulsive drug seeking behavior, which persists despite negative socioeconomic and health consequences, and is characteristic of cocaine dependence. It has been estimated that 5-6% of recent cocaine users will become cocaine dependent after the onset of first use ([O’brien & Anthony, 2005](#R27)). To date there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmacological treatments for cocaine dependence and therefore studies into the genetic basis of this disorder may help elucidate the neurobiological basis of cocaine dependence and in turn generate new pharmacological therapies.\n\nThe neurotransmitter dopamine is known to play a major role in drug reward ([Dackis & O’brien, 2005](#R13)). Elevations in extracellular dopamine (DA) in brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens and the ventral striatum are believed to underlie the reinforcing properties of cocaine ([Di Chiara et al., 2004](#R15), [Volkow, 2002](#R36)) as cocaine binds to DA receptors and decreases DA re-uptake ([Hyman et al., 2006](#R21)). Cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1) are G-protein coupled receptors which are densely expressed throughout the mesolimbic system ([Herkenham et al., 1990](#R19)). CB1 plays a direct role in the dopaminergic reward pathway, relaying signal cascades at the terminals of striatal medium spiny neurons, regulating dopamine and glutamate release as well as the long-lasting neuroplastic desensitizing effects inherent with chronic cocaine use ([Cheer et al., 2007a](#R8), [Corbillé et al., 2007](#R10), [Filip et al., 2006](#R16), [Xi et al., 2006](#R38)).\n\nPharmacological blockade of CB1 receptors has been shown to reduce the inhibitory effect of cocaine on GABA neurotransmission in rats ([Centonze et al., 2004](#R7)) and attenuate the dopaminergic increases in the nucleus accumbens induced by cocaine administration ([Cheer et al., 2007b](#R9)). CB1 receptors have also proven to be relevant for relapse into cocaine seeking behavior as CB1 antagonists (SR141716) administered during prolonged cocaine withdrawal have been shown to reduce cocaine seeking behaviour induced by cue-exposure. Conversely, pre-treatment with CB1 agonists increases relapse behavior in mice undergoing cocaine withdrawal ([De Vries et al., 2001](#R14)).\n\nWhile the interplay between genetic and environmental factors underlying cocaine dependence is not fully understood, studies have estimated that approximately two thirds of an individual’s risk for developing cocaine dependence is heritable ([Kendler et al., 2000](#R22), [Kendler & Prescott, 1998](#R23)). As the cannabinoid system is known to influence dopaminergic signaling and relapse to cocaine seeking behavior in animals, genetic studies analysing polymorphisms in *CNR1* may reveal genetic variation that increases the risk for cocaine dependence. Two SNPs in *CNR1*, rs6454674 and rs806368, were found to be associated with cocaine dependence and cocaine induced paranoia across three independent populations of European and African Americans ([Zuo et al., 2009](#R39)). These same SNPs were found to be associated with alcohol and illicit drug dependence in European Americans ([Zuo et al, 2007](#R40)) and rs806368 has demonstrated association with cannabis dependence (Agrawal et al, 2008). The purpose of the current study was to analyze these two SNPs in an independent African American population of cocaine dependents in order to provide replication of the findings of Zuo et al ([Zuo et al., 2009](#R39)). The two SNPs, rs6454674 and rs806368, were chosen for replication because of their consistent association with both cocaine and general substance dependence.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Sample collection\n\nBlood samples for DNA isolation from cocaine-dependent individuals of African-American decent (n=926; 67% male, mean age: 43) were collected during clinical studies of cocaine dependence at the University of Pennsylvania Treatment Research Center. Subjects were at least 18 years of age. All were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) and urine drug screens were obtained. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of cocaine dependence as defined by *DSM-IV*. Family history was not obtained and ethnicity was determined by self-report. All psychiatric axis I disorders except alcohol dependence/abuse and nicotine dependence were used as exclusion criteria. In addition, participants were excluded if they had a history of a seizure disorder (except cocaine-induced seizures) or a severe medical illness, including a history of AIDS (but not merely of HIV+ status). Individuals currently being treated with psychotropic medications or with psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, dementia, suicidal or homicidal ideation, mania or depression requiring antidepressant therapy were also excluded. Blood samples from control persons of African-American descent (n=346; 32% male, mean age: 40) were collected at the University of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson University, and the National Institute of Mental Health Genetics Initiative ([www.nimhgenetics.org](http://www.nimhgenetics.org)). Control individuals were screened for history of substance use disorders or other psychiatric illness. They were not assessed with a urine drug screen and ethnicity was determined by self-report. Subjects with a history of substance dependence or a history of major psychiatric illness were excluded from this study ([Berrettini & Persico, 1996](#R6)). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes within obtained blood samples by standard protocols. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Thomas Jefferson University and the University of Pennsylvania, and all subjects provided written informed consent before blood sample collection.\n\n### SNP selection and genotyping\n\nThe *CB1* gene is located on chromosome 6q14-q15. *CB1* contains 1 exon and spans 26,084bp (Ensembl Human Exon View accession ENST00000369499). SNPs for genotyping were selected based on previous positive findings in a European American population (SNP1: rs6454674; SNP2: rs806368) ([Zuo et al., 2009](#R39)). SNP genotyping was performed using Applied Biosystems Inc. (ABI) (Foster City, CA, USA) ‘Assays-on-demand’ as per manufacturer protocol.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe allelic and genotypic association of SNPs with cocaine dependence was determined using the chi-square test and p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure ([Benjamini et al., 2001](#R4)) in the software package PLINK v1.04 ([Purcell et al., 2007](#R30)). Correction for multiple testing was carried out using the false discovery rate (FDR) method ([Benjamini & Hochberg, 2000](#R5)).\n\nHaplotype analysis was performed in PLINK using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm implicated in the software packages ([http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/)) ([Purcell et al., 2007](#R30)). Permutation analysis of the haplotypic associations was conducted to randomly reassign the case and control labels in the dataset and give a significance level corrected for all markers or haplotypes tested. A total of 10 000 permutations were performed in each permutation analysis.\n\nOur sample size had reasonable power to detect a disease association at a *P*-value less than or equal to 0.05, assuming an odds ratio of 1.5 and a minor allele frequency of 30% (82% for a general 2df test, 89% for a dominant, and 15% for a recessive mode of inheritance).\n\n## Results\n\nMeasures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two markers were shown to be weak (r^2^ =0.002, D’ =0.179) which is consistent with the findings of Zuo et al who also analysed these SNPs in an independent African American population ([Zuo et al., 2009](#R39)). Quality control was maintained by genotyping 10% duplicates for cases and controls, and the concordance rate for our genotyping was calculated to be 99.92%. None of the genotype counts deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the total population ([Balding, 2006](#R3)) however, rs806368 displayed a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg amongst the cases (p=0.03). State the nature of the deviation, eg, an excess of homozygotes for the minor allele.\n\nSingle marker analysis yielded evidence for genotypic association for both rs806368 (p=0.017, OR=0.75, 95% C.I =0.54-0.96) and rs6454674 (p=0.05, OR=1.14, 95% C.I=0.94-1.39). The C allele of rs806368 was found to have a protective effect against cocaine dependence and was observed at a higher genotype frequency in controls compared to cases. For rs6454674 the G allele was observed to be at a higher frequency in cases that were minor homozygotes for this allele (0.13 vs 0.08) and therefore conferred risk for cocaine dependence. Genotypic and allelic associations are summarized in [table one](#T1). After performing genotypic associations it became apparent that rs6454674 was acting under a recessive mode of inheritance and therefore, performing a chi-square test to analyze the recessive SNP action of rs6454674 (DD vs Dd,dd) increased the significance to p=0.017). The genotypic tests for association for both SNPs withstood correction for multiple testing according to the false discovery method (FDR P=≤0.05). Haplotype analysis did not show significant associations for two marker analysis (data not shown).\n\n### Table one.\n\n| SNP | Population (N) | AA | Aa | aa | Minor Allele | P-Value | MAF | P-Value | OR (95% C.I) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| rs806368 | Cases (883) | 0.817 | 0.182 | 0.001 | C | 0.0171 | 0.09 | 0.05 | 0.75 (0.54-0.96) |\n| Controls (334) | 0.78 | 0.21 | 0.02 |   |   | 0.12 |   |   |  |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| rs6454674 | Cases (859) | 0.42 | 0.45 | 0.13 | G | 0.05 0.0172 | 0.35 | 0.19 | 1.14 (0.94-1.39) |\n| Controls (316) | 0.43 | 0.49 | 0.08 |   |   | 0.32 |   |   |  |\n\nTable Caption: Comparison of genotype and allele frequencies in 2 CNR1 SNPs.

When the data was combined rs806368 no longer remained significant (p=0.19) however, rs6454674 increased in significance (p=0.004). These data are presented in [table two](#T2).\n\n### Table two.\n\n| SNP | Population (N) | AA | Aa | aa | P-Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |\n| rs806368 | Cases (1276) | 0.817 | 0.175 | 0.008 | 0.19 |\n| Controls (543) | 0.80 | 0.19 | 0.02 |   |  |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |\n| rs6454674 | Cases (1193) | 0.44 | 0.42 | 0.14 | 0.004 |\n| Controls (492) | 0.41 | 0.5 | 0.09 |   |  |\n\nTable Caption: Meta-analysis comparing genotype frequencies in cocaine dependents and unrelated controls using data from the present study combined with genotype counts from the African Americans genotyped in Zuo et al (2009).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe data presented in this study demonstrate an association of 2 *CNR1* SNPs, rs6454674 and rs806368, with cocaine dependence in individuals of African descent. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis using the data reported by Zuo and colleagues ([Zuo et al., 2009](#R39)). The meta-analysis provides the largest sample of African American cocaine dependents and controls (N=1800) studied for genetic risk for cocaine dependence to date, and the findings display an increased significance from p=0.02 in our sample to p=0.004 for rs6454674. These data confirm the relevance of these 2 polymorphisms when considering genetic risk for cocaine dependence in African Americans; however it should be noted that our findings may reflect an association with a more general substance abuse phenotype. Poly-substance abuse is high amongst cocaine dependents, it has been reported that amongst cocaine dependants alcohol co-dependence occurs approximately 85% of the time in the community ([Regier et al., 1990](#R31)). rs6454674 has previously been associated with alcohol dependence and drug dependence (cocaine and opioids) in European Americans ([Zuo et al., 2007](#R40)). Furthemore, rs806368 has been modestly associated with cannabis dependence in European Americans (P=0.05) and the co-morbitity with alcoholism in this sample was estimated to be roughly 70% ([Agrawal et al., 2009](#R1)). As CB1 has been found to interact with brain dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic and opioidergic systems its association with substance dependence in general is plausible considering the receptor mediates the neurochemical effects of nearly all drugs of abuse ([Ameri, 1999](#R2), [Manzanares et al., 1999](#R25), [Romero et al., 2002](#R32)). The following sentence is incorrect and must be re-written. Interestingly animal models have shown that CB1 does not modulate the primary reinforcing effect of psychostimulants as *Cnr1* null mice do not self-administer cocaine or show changes to conditioned place preference when compared to wild-types ([Cossu et al., 2001](#R11)). However, CB1 is required for the maintenance of cocaine seeking behavior as *Cnr1* knockout mice will not continue to seek cocaine when the effort to obtain cocaine infusions is enhanced ([Soria et al., 2005](#R33)). Conversely, mice lacking *Cnr1* show a decreased alcohol preference and a reduction in ethanol place preference ([Hungund et al., 2003](#R20), [Thanos et al., 2005](#R34), [Wang et al., 2003](#R37)). Therefore, considering the high co-morbidity of alcohol dependence with cocaine and cannabis dependence, future work should be carried out to determine whether *CNR1* polymorphisms are relevant for addiction to cocaine or whether this reflects a stronger association with alcohol dependence.\n\nOne caveat to our finding is that the are very few homozygotes for the minor allele among the controls and the cases at rs806368, suggesting that the statistical significance may be a false positive. Larger samples sizes are required when the minor allele frequency is low. Our finding associating rs654657 with cocaine dependence in African Americans confirms the findings of Zuo et al however rs806368 was only found to be associated with European Americans in this study as they report no association in African Americans. It should be noted that genetic studies including individuals of self-reported ancestry are susceptible to population stratification ([Freedman et al., 2004](#R17)) and the genetic admixture in African Americans has been shown to be larger than expected ([Parra et al., 2001](#R28), [Pfaff et al., 2004](#R29), [Tian et al., 2006](#R35)). Indeed, rs806363 has a higher minor allele frequency in Europeans (C=0.19) compared to Yoruban Africans in Nigeria (C=0.08) according to data from the International Hapmap Project ([www.hapmap.org](http://www.hapmap.org)). Therefore, different degrees of population admixture between the two African American samples may be responsible for the discrepancies in the association analyses. There are other studies which have failed to associate *CNR1* with substance dependence however these studies have either had considerably smaller sample sizes ([Heller et al., 2001](#R18)) or analysed different polymorphisms to the ones presented in this study ([Covault et al., 2001](#R12), [Li et al., 2000](#R24)). Indeed, the effect sizes reported in this association study for each SNP are modest (OR =1.14) and therefore a large sample size would be needed to detect such a small effect. Despite this, the result should be interpreted with caution and further replication may be needed to confirm the role of rs806363, if any, in cocaine dependence.\n\nIn order to understand the biological relevance of these findings it is important to know how these 2 polymorphisms in *CNR1* convey risk for cocaine dependence. rs806368 is located in the 3’UTR and is in a region of the genome characterized by high evolutionary conservation (Perhaps show a figure with the diagram of the gene and the location of the SNPs with the r2 value. Also show the evolutionary conservation. It is plausible therefore that this SNP affects the stability of the *CNR1* mRNA transcript which may reduce the rate of translation. This may have biological consequences relevant for cocaine dependence. However, the 2 SNPs analyzed in this study may only be acting as proxies for the true causal variants and therefore additional work is needed to identify the mechanism by which these genetic variants increase the risk for cocaine dependence. In conclusion, there is now substantial emerging data to suggest that polymorphisms in *CNR1* are relevant for susceptibility to substance dependence. One group of individuals for whom this is becoming increasingly relevant is cocaine dependents of African descent. Further work is warranted to identify the biological mechanisms by which *CNR1* SNPs increase risk for cocaine dependence and also to determine whether *CNR1* is specifically relevant for cocaine dependence or substance dependence in general.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Our objective was to characterize two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2A6*24, 594G>C (Val110Leu) and 6458A>T (Asn438Tyr). We determined their haplotype, allele frequencies, effect on CYP2A6 activity in vivo, as well as their stability and ability to metabolize nicotine in vitro. CYP2A6*35 (6458A>T) occurred at a frequency of 2.5–2.9% among individuals of black African descent, 0.5–0.8% among Asians, and was not found in Caucasians. In addition, we identified two novel alleles, CYP2A6*36 (6458A>T and 6558T>C [Ile471Thr]) and CYP2A6*37 (6458A>T, 6558T>C, and 6600G>T [Arg485Leu]). In vivo, CYP2A6*35 was associated with lower CYP2A6 activity as measured by the 3HC/COT ratio. In vitro, CYP2A6.35 had decreased nicotine C-oxidation activity and thermal stability. In conclusion, we identified three novel CYP2A6 alleles (CYP2A6*35, *36, and *37); the higher allele frequency variant CYP2A6*35 was associated with lower CYP2A6 activity.\n\nKeywords: Nicotine, Cotinine, CYP2A6, Smoking, Pharmacogenetics\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nCigarette’s addictive properties are largely due to the psychoactive effects of nicotine.^1^ Due to the relatively short half-life of nicotine, approximately 2 hours,^2^ dependent smokers smoke at regular intervals to maintain nicotine levels. Therefore, factors that influence the intake or removal (e.g. metabolism) of nicotine from the body can affect smoking behaviours such as the number of cigarettes smoked or the likelihood of cessation.^3–6^\n\n*In vivo*, 70–80% of nicotine is metabolized to cotinine,^2^ and cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) mediates approximately 90% of this reaction.^7, 8^ CYP2A6 also exclusively mediates cotinine’s (COT) hydroxylation to *trans*-3′-hydroxycotinine (3HC), making the metabolic ratio of 3HC/COT a specific and reliable marker of CYP2A6 activity.^9–11^ The 3HC/COT ratio correlates with the rate of nicotine clearance ^10^ and is stable over time, ^12^ thereby facilitating its use as a proxy measure for the rate of CYP2A6 mediated nicotine metabolism in population studies. A common feature of nicotine pharmacokinetic studies is the large interindividual variability in the rate of metabolism. ^13–15^ Sources of this large variability may include environmental (e.g. smoking), physiological (e.g. systemic diseases), and genetic (e.g. *CYP2A6* polymorphisms) factors.^16^\n\nRecently, we characterized the effect of a number of established and novel *CYP2A6* alleles on CYP2A6 activity and nicotine disposition kinetics in a population of black African descent.^15^ Interestingly, most of the novel alleles were associated with lower *in vivo* CYP2A6 activity, accounting for some of the previously uncharacterized variability and slower nicotine metabolism in this population. Nonetheless, even after controlling for gender, smoking, and known *CYP2A6* alleles, large variability in CYP2A6 activity still remains. One possible source of the remaining variation is the presence of additional genetic variants. Through sequencing, we found that *CYP2A6*24* contains two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 594G>C (Val110Leu); and 6458A>T (Asn438Tyr).^15^ A question that remained is whether 594G>C or 6458A>T can occur on their own, and if so, what are their allele frequencies and functional impact on CYP2A6 activity.\n\nIn the current study we genotyped multiple ethnic populations for 594G>C (Val110Leu) and 6458A>T (Asn438Tyr), assessed their allele frequencies, and examined their impact on *in vivo* CYP2A6 activity using the 3HC/COT ratio. In addition, we created cDNA expressed variants CYP2A6.V110L (Val110Leu), CYP2A6.35 (Asn438Tyr), CYP2A6.24 (Val110Leu + Asn438Tyr) and assessed their thermal stability and ability to metabolize nicotine to cotinine *in vitro* using an *E. coli* heterologous expression system.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Allele frequency of CYP2A6*35 and identification of novel alleles CYP2A6*36 and CYP2A6*37\n\nSince *CYP2A6*24* is a haplotype containing 594G>C and 6458A>T,^15^ individuals positively genotyped for these two variants were considered to have *CYP2A6*24*, while individuals positively genotyped for 6458A>T alone formed the *CYP2A6*35* group. We did not find any individuals with the 594G>C SNP alone in any of the ethnic groups. *CYP2A6*24* occurred at an allele frequency of 0.7% among African American smokers (n = 1234 alleles), and was not found among Caucasians (n = 304 alleles), Japanese (n = 120 alleles), Chinese (n = 196 alleles), or Taiwanese (n = 334 alleles). Alleles here are inferred by assuming that each individual has 2 copies of chromosome 19 containing one allele on each chromosome. Previously we found *CYP2A6*24* at a frequency of 1.3% among an African Canadian population (1.4% in smokers and 1.1% in nonsmokers) and characterized it as a low activity variant.^15^ *CYP2A6*35* was found among individuals of African descent with a frequency of 2.9% and 2.5% in African American smokers and African Canadians (1.8% in smokers and 3.3% in nonsmokers), respectively. The allele was also found in Japanese (0.8%), Taiwanese (0.6%), and Chinese (0.5%) but not among Caucasians. The genotype frequencies of *CYP2A6*24* and *CYP2A6*35* did not significantly deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in any population.\n\nThe variant *CYP2A6*35* allele from one African Canadian, one African American, and one Taiwanese individual were fully sequenced. The variant allele *CYP2A6*35A* was identical among the African American and African Canadian individuals, while the allele *CYP2A6*35B* in the Taiwanese individual differed modestly ([table 1](#T1)). The allele frequencies of *CYP2A6*35* presented herein include both *CYP2A6*35A* and *CYP2A6*35B*. In addition, we identified two novel alleles, *CYP2A6*36* and *CYP2A6*37. CYP2A6*36* contains 6458A>T in haplotype with 6558T>C present in *CYP2A6*7*, while *CYP2A6*37* contains 6458A>T and two additional SNPs present in *CYP2A6*10* (6558T>C and 6600G>T), [table 1](#T1). *CYP2A6*36* and *CYP2A6*37* were only found among Taiwanese individuals, both at a frequency of 0.3%. These alleles were not included in estimating the allele frequency of *CYP2A6*35*.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| CYP2A6*35A | CYP2A6*35B | CYP2A6*36 | CYP2A6*37 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| -1301A>C | -1301A>C | -1301A>C | -1301A>C |\n| -1289G>A | -1289G>A | -1289G>A | -1289G>A |\n|   | -745A>G | -745A>G | -745A>G |\n| -1013A>G |   |   |   |\n|   | 22C>T (L8L, Exon 1) | 22C>T (L8L, Exon 1) | 22C>T (L8L, Exon 1) |\n| 720G>A, Intron 2 |   |   |   |\n| 1137C>G, Intron 2 |   |   |   |\n| 1620T>C, Intron 2 | 1620T>C, Intron 2 | 1620T>C, Intron 2 | 1620T>C, Intron 2 |\n| 2483G>A, Intron 4 |   |   |   |\n| 3225A>G, Intron 4 |   |   |   |\n|   | 4084delA, Intron 5 | 4084delA, Intron 5 | 4084delA, Intron 5 |\n| 6218A>G, Intron 8 |   |   |   |\n| 6282A>G, Intron 8 |   |   |   |\n| 6293T>C, Intron 8 |   |   |   |\n| 6354T>C, Intron 8 |   |   | 6354T>C, Intron 8 |\n| 6458A>T (N438Y, Exon 9) | 6458A>T (N438Y, Exon 9) | 6458A>T (N438Y, Exon 9) | 6458A>T (N438Y, Exon 9) |\n|   |   | 6558T>C (I471T, Exon 9) | 6558T>C (I471T, Exon 9) |\n|   |   |   | 6600G>T (R485L, Exon 9) |\n| 2A6*1B | 2A6*1B | 2A6*1B | 2A6*1B |\n| 6782C>G | 6782C>G | 6782C>G | 6782C>G |\n|   | 6835C>A | 6835C>A | 6835C>A |\n|   |   |   | 6936_6937insCACTT |\n|   |   |   | 6961_6962insGAAAAG |\n|   |   |   | 6989A>G |\n|   | 6999T>C | 6999T>C | 6999T>C |\n| 7160A>G | 7160A>G | 7160A>G | 7160A>G |\n\nTable 1 Caption: CYP2A6*35(A and B), CYP2A6*36, and CYP2A6*37 alleles\n\n### CYP2A6*35 is associated with lower CYP2A6 activity in vivo\n\nIn the African Canadian population, individuals with *CYP2A6*1/*35* genotype had significantly lower mean 3HC/COT compared to those in the wildtype group (*CYP2A6*1/*1*), [table 2](#T2). Four individuals were compound heterozygotes, one having *CYP2A6*9/**35 and three having *CYP2A6*17/*35*. All four individuals had substantially lower 3HC/COT ratios compared to wildtype and heterozygote *CYP2A6*1/*35* individuals ([table 2](#T2)).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Population | Genotype | n | Mean adjusted 3HC/COT | S.D. | p-value | % of wildtype activity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| African Canadian | *1/*1 | 151 | 1.20 | 0.63 |   | 100 |\n|   | *1/*35 | 10 | 0.84 | 0.50 | 0.02 | 70 |\n|   | *9/*35a | 1 | 0.47 | - |   | 39 |\n|   | *17/*35a | 3 | 0.08 | 0.14 |   | 7 |\n| African American | *1/*1 | 258 | 1.21 | 0.80 |   | 100 |\n|   | *1/*35 | 20 | 0.75 | 0.26 | 0.003b | 62 |\n|   | *35/*35a | 1 | 0.51 | - |   | 42 |\n|   | *9/*35a | 2 | 0.78 | 0.51 |   | 62 |\n|   | *17/*35a | 3 | 0.27 | 0.09 |   | 22 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: CYP2A6*35 is associated with lower in vivo CYP2A6 activity.\n\nAmong the African Americans, those with *CYP2A6*1/*35* genotype also had significantly lower mean 3HC/COT compared to individuals in the wildtype group (*CYP2A6*1/*1*), [table 2](#T2). In addition, an individual homozygous for *CYP2A6*35* had lower 3HC/COT compared to the heterozygous individuals suggestive of a gene-dose effect. As seen in the African Canadian population, this population had compound heterozygote individuals (*CYP2A6*9/*35*, n = 2 and *CYP2A6*17/*35*, n = 3) with lower 3HC/COT values compared to wildtype.\n\n### In vitro enzymatic activities of the CYP2A6 variants\n\nThe apparent Km and Vmax values for nicotine C-oxidation by CYP2A6.1 and the variant constructs is presented in [table 3](#T3). The Vmax value of CYP2A6.17 trended towards being lower compared to CYP2A6.1 (p=0.1), while the other variants (CYP2A6.V110L, CYP2A6.35, and CYP2A6.24) had similar values compared to CYP2A6.1. The apparent Km value of CYP2A6.17 was significantly higher than that of CYP2A6.1. The Km values of CYP2A6.V110L, and CYP2A6.35 trended to be higher compared to CYP2A6.1, while CYP2A6.24 trended to have a lower value. The resulting Vmax/Km (catalytic efficiency) values of CYP2A6.17, CYP2A6.V110L, and CYP2A6.35 were significantly lower compared to that of CYP2A6.1. In contrast, the Vmax/Km value of CYP2A6.24 was similar to that of CYP2A6.1.\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   | Km (μM) | Vmax (pmol/min/pmol CYP2A6) | Vmax/Km (nl/min/pmol CYP2A6) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CYP2A6.1 | 7.0±0.7 | 0.53±0.04 | 8.0±0.6 |\n| CYP2A6.17 | 33.4±3.3* | 0.36±0.03 | 1.1±0.1* |\n| CYP2A6.V110L | 11.3±1.4 | 0.52±0.06 | 4.7±0.3* |\n| CYP2A6.35 | 9.9±0.8 | 0.49±0.05 | 5.0±0.2* |\n| CYP2A6.24 | 5.4±1.8 | 0.53±0.09 | 10.5±1.9 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Kinetic parameters of the wildtype and variant CYP2A6 constructs for the metabolism of nicotine.\n\nTo determine whether the amino acid changes could affect protein stability we tested the thermal stability of the constructs by incubating them at 37°C and collecting aliquots at various times to measure nicotine C-oxidation activity and CYP2A6 protein levels. Generally, the activity of the variant constructs decreased to a greater extent compared to the wildtype construct ([figure 1A](#F1)). The time it took to decrease CYP2A6 activity by 50% (t_1/2_) was significantly shorter for CYP2A6.17 (t_1/2_ = 2.2 hrs), CYP2A6.V110L (t_1/2_ = 2.9 hrs), and CYP2A6.35 (t_1/2_ = 2.6 hrs) compared to CYP2A6.1 (t_1/2_ = 4.3 hrs, p<0.05), while the t_1/2_ of CYP2A6.24 was similar to CYP2A6.1 (4.6 vs. 4.3 hrs, respectively). With incubation time the CYP2A6.1 protein levels did not change, while the protein levels of CYP2A6.17, CYP2A6.V110L, CYP2A6.35, and CYP2A6.24 decreased ([figure 1B](#F1)). Of note, CYP2A6 protein expression following E. coli culture was lower among the variant constructs compared to wildtype, CYP2A6.1 > CYP2A6.V110L and CYP2A6.24 > CYP2A6.35 > CYP2A6.17 (0.44 > 0.38 > 0.20 > 0.10 pmol of CYP2A6/μg of membrane protein, respectively).\n\n### Figure 1. Thermal stability of the CYP2A6 wildtype and variant constructs at 37 °C.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/990e/2922203/d8e3b9577094/nihms1468f1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2922203_nihms1468f1.jpg)\n\n(A) Activities are expressed as the percentage of remaining enzymatic activity for each construct with the activity at 0 hrs recorded as 100%. Aliquots (10 pmoles of CYP2A6 enzyme for each construct) were taken at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours to measure cotinine formation using 30 μM of nicotine. The activity of each construct at 0 hours is displayed as 100%, and over time, the activity was measured for each construct and expressed as a percent remaining. We used this approach to minimize potential impact of modestly different amounts of estimated CYP2A6 in the initial reaction. The lines through the points are stimulated using the plateau and rate of decay (k) values obtained for each CYP2A6 construct from the one phase decay equation as described in the methods. (B) Immunoreactive CYP2A6 protein at the indicated times of incubation. With time, the protein levels of the CYP2A6 variant constructs decreased while CYP2A6.1 protein levels remained the same. At 24 hrs, no CYP2A6 protein was detected with any of the CYP2A6 constructs (data not shown). 1.2 pmoles of CYP2A6 was loaded in each well.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe focus of the present study was two SNPs found in *CYP2A6*, 594G>C and 6458A>T. Here, we did not find individuals with 594G>C alone, suggesting that 594G>C is in obligate haplotype with 6458A>T forming *CYP2A6*24*. Conversely, individuals with only 6458A>T were found. The allele containing 6458A>T was sequenced and assigned the name *CYP2A6*35* by the CYP-allele nomenclature committee ([http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/](http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/)). *CYP2A6*35* was predominantly found among individuals of African descent and to a lesser extent among individuals of Asian descent. The *CYP2A6*35* allele sequence differed slightly between African and Asian descent distinguishing it as *CYP2A6*35A* and *CYP2A6*35B*, respectively. We also discovered two novel alleles among Taiwanese individuals where the 6458A>T SNP was in haplotype with 6558T>C in *CYP2A6*7* or 6558T>C + 6600G>T in *CYP2A6*10*, forming *CYP2A6*36* and *CYP2A6*37*, respectively. We could not test the functional *in vivo* consequence of *CYP2A6*36* and *CYP2A6*37*, but since both of these rare alleles contain the amino acid substitution (Ile471Thr) found in *CYP2A6*7* and *CYP2A6*10* it is likely they will result in a loss of function. The substitution Ile471Thr has been associated with lower CYP2A6 activity and stability *in vitro* (E. coli system) ^17^ in addition to lower *in vivo* CYP2A6 activity in multiple studies.^18–21^\n\nOur *in vivo* data strongly suggests that *CYP2A6*35* is associated with lower CYP2A6 activity. In both African populations, individuals heterozygous for *CYP2A6*35* had ~70% of the activity of the wildtype CYP2A6 group, a reduction in activity that is similar to well characterized decreased function alleles *CYP2A6*9*, *CYP2A6*12*, and *CYP2A6*17*.^14, 15, 22^ Several case-control studies have associated *CYP2A6* genetic variants that result in lower CYP2A6 activity with a lower likelihood of smoking;^5, 23^ however, negative finding have also been reported.^24, 25^ Among the African Canadians, a trend was observed in which individuals with *CYP2A6*35* were less likely to be current adult smokers (OR = 0.51; 95% C.I. = 0.17–1.60, p = 0.19). The allele frequency of *CYP2A6*35* was 3.3% (n = 9/269 alleles) in smokers compared to 1.8% (n = 5/275 alleles) in nonsmokers. The magnitude of the effect was the same when analysis was restricted to individuals with only *CYP2A6*1/*1* and *CYP2A6*1/*35* (OR = 0.39, 95% C.I. 0.01–1.60, p = 0.19). All the African American individuals were participants in a smoking cessation trial (i.e. smokers) limiting our ability to further test this hypothesis.\n\nOur *in vitro* enzymatic function data ([table 3](#T3)) suggests that the variants CYP2A6.V110L (Val110Leu) and CYP2A6.35 (Asn438Tyr) result in lower nicotine C-oxidation activity compared to the wildtype. This was driven by the higher apparent Km values observed for CYP2A6.V110L and CYP2A6.35. In addition, CYP2A6.V110L and CYP2A6.35 had reduced thermal stability compared to the wildtype. The most dramatic reduction in stability was seen following 4 hrs of incubation, in which the constructs CYP2A6.17, CYP2A6.V110L, and CYP2A6.35 lost more than 50% of their initial activity, while the wildtype (CYP2A6.1) lost only about 30% of its initial activity. It is interesting to note that the amino acid substitutions Val110Leu and Asn438Tyr are not highly conserved among the CYP2A family. For instance, the human CYP2A13 and the mouse CYP2A5, both of which metabolize nicotine efficiently, have leucine (Leu) at position 110 and tyrosine (Tyr) at position 438. In addition, the physical and chemical properties of valine (Val) and leucine (Leu) and asparginine (Asn) and tyrosine (Tyr) are similar to each other (e.g. Val and Leu are similarly aliphatic, whereas Asp and Tyr are similarly polar). It is possible though that the positions of the following amino acid changes are important. Valine 110 resides within the substrate recognition site 1 (SRS1, residues 101–120)^26^ and is in very close proximity to the active site of CYP2A6.^27, 28^ Thus, this substitution (Val110Leu) might alter the active site cavity.^28^ On the other hand, asparginine 438 resides on the surface o CYP2A6 and is situated next to the conserved heme-binding cysteine 439.^26, 29^ Thus, it is possible that the amino acid substitution Asn438Tyr might affect the binding of the heme. In our study the reduction in protein levels did not fully complement the reduction in CYP activity suggesting that the heat treatment might have also facilitated the loss of heme. We were unable to test this (due to the low sensitivity of our assay); however it would be valuable in the future to determine the stability of the holoenzyme by obtaining the CO-difference spectrum for the constructs.\n\nIt was surprising for us to find that individually Val110Leu and Asn438Tyr reduced CYP2A6 activity and stability, while in CYP2A6.24 the occurrence of both amino acid changes appeared to have stabilized the enzyme. This is in contrast to our previously published study^15^, in which individuals with *CYP2A6*24* were associated with lower CYP2A6 activity measured by the 3HC/COT ratio *in vivo*. There are several possible reasons for the discordance between the *in vivo* and *in vitro* data for *CYP2A6*24*. It is possible that the coding SNPs might be affecting protein degradation (discussed below). Alternatively, the coding SNPs might be in linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms in the gene promoter or within introns that affect transcription and mRNA splicing, and as a result might influence function *in vivo*. For example, *CYP2A6*35A* and *CYP2A6*24* contain -1013A>G, which is thought to disrupt a putative enhancer region^30^, while *CYP2A6*35B* contains -745A>G that is thought to disrupt a CCAAT box to which the regulatory element NF-Y binds.^31^ Both of these promoter SNPs have been shown to result in decreased expression in a reporter construct system.^30, 31^.\n\nThe protein levels of CYP2A6.1 did not appear to decrease during the first 12 hrs of incubation, while its activity did. This is likely due to the fact that immunoblotting not only detected functional holoenzyme, but also apoenzyme and misfolded CYP2A6. However, it is interesting to note that unlike CYP2A6.1, the CYP2A6 protein levels of the variant constructs all decreased with incubation time suggesting that these constructs are more susceptible to degradation. It was also noted that the CYP2A6 variant constructs had lower CYP2A6 protein expression (pmoles of CYP2A6/μg of membrane protein) compared to the wildtype construct following culturing of the E. coli. There is a growing body of evidence for nonsynonymous coding SNPs influencing enzymatic function by decreasing the amount of protein through accelerated degradation.^32–35^ Much of this evidence comes from cytoplasmic proteins such as thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT),^32^ and has also been shown for cytochromes P450. For example, Bandiera *et al*. demonstrated that CYP1B1.4 is expressed at lower levels compared to CYP1B1.1 in COS-1 cells largely due to its increased rate of degradation.^35^\n\nThe present study suggests that *CYP2A6*35* is associated with lower *in vivo* CYP2A6 activity, likely due to its lower nicotine C-oxidation activity, stability, and greater susceptibility to protein degradation. Because of its lower stability, *CYP2A6*35* is likely to result in lower *in vivo* activities toward all CYP2A6 substrates; however this remains to be tested. In conclusion, we have identified several novel alleles (*CYP2A6*35*, *CYP2A6*36*, and *CYP2A6*37*), one of which (*CYP2A6*35*) is found at a relatively high frequency among individuals of African descent and is associated with lower CYP2A6 activity *in vivo*. Identifying and characterizing novel *CYP2A6* variants among different ethnic groups will help refine the relationship between *CYP2A6* genotype and nicotine metabolism phenotype, thus increasing the utility of genotyping in epidemiological and clinical treatment studies.^15, 36, 37^\n\n## MATERIALS and METHODS\n\n### CYP2A6 6458A>T genotype assay\n\nA two-step PCR assay was developed to detect the 6458A>T SNP based on the reference genomic sequence [NG_000008.7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NG_000008.7). The first PCR reaction amplified a gene specific region from intron 6 to the 3′-flanking region utilizing the primers 2A6in6F1 and 2A6R0 as described previously.^38^ In the second PCR reaction, an allele specific region (1327 bp) from exon 9 to the 3′-flanking region of CYP2A6 was amplified utilizing one of two forward primers 2A6in8ex9F6458W or 2A6in8ex9F6458V in combination with one reverse primer 2A6R0 ([table 4](#T4)). The 25 μl reaction consisted of: 1 X PCR buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl), 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 1.25 mM MgCl_2_, 0.15 μM of each primer, 0.25 U of Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas, Burlington, Canada), 0.8 μl of undiluted 1^st^ amplification PCR product, and H_2_O. Initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min was followed by 20 cycles, each consisting of, denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec, annealing at 55°C for 20 sec, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. 594G>C was detected as described previously.^15^ The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.2 % agarose gel (OnBio, Richmond Hill, Canada) stained with ethidium bromide. The assay was developed using multiple cosmids containing genomic clones of CYP2A6 as a positive control and CYP2A7 and CYP2A13 as negative controls (gratefully provided by Dr. Linda Ashworth, Human Genome Centre, Liverpool).^39^\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Primer | Sequence | Location |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2A65Pr1Fa | 5′-ACC TAG ACT TAA TCT TCC CGT ATA C-3′ | 5′-flanking region |\n| 2A6in8ex9F6458W | 5′-TCC TCA GGA AAG CGG A-3′ | Intron8/Exon9 |\n| 2A6in8ex9F6458V | 5′-TCC TCA GGA AAG CGG T-3′ | Intron8/Exon9 |\n| 2A6R0b | 5′-AGG TCA TCT AGA TTT TCT CCT ACA-3′ | 3′-flanking region |\n| 2A6_594G>C | 5′-GCC ACC TTC GAC TGG CTC TTC AAA GGC TAT G-3′ | Exon 2 |\n| 2A6_594G>C Anti | 5′-CAT AGC CTT TGA AGA GCC AGT CGA AGG TGG C-3′ | Exon 2 |\n| 2A6_6458A>T | 5′-TTC CAT CGG AAA GCG GTA CTG TTT CGG AGA AGG-3′ | Exon 8/9 |\n| 2A6_6458A>T Anti | 5′-CCT TCT CCG AAA CAG TAC CGC TTT CCG ATG GAA-3′ | Exon 8/9 |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Primers used.\n\n### CYP2A6 sequencing\n\nTo confirm our genotyping assay and determine the haplotype of the allele, we amplified (Long PCR) and sequenced a 9.2 kb fragment containing the *CYP2A6* gene from 3 individuals heterozygous for 6458A>T (one African Canadian, one African American, and one Taiwanese). The 25 μl PCR reaction utilized the primers 2A65Pr1F and 2A6R0 ([table 4](#T4)) and was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (long PCR enzyme mix, MBI Fermentas, Burlington, Canada) with the following minor modifications. The annealing temperature was 57°C and the reaction contained 75 ng of DNA, 0.3 mM of each dNTP, and 0.25 μM of each primer. The PCR product was subcloned and sequenced as described previously.^15^ In addition, the *CYP2A6* gene (9.2 kb) of two individuals was amplified. One was genotyped as having 6458A>T as well as 6558T>C present in *CYP2A6*7*, while the other was genotyped as having 6458A>T and 6558T>C + 6600G>T present in *CYP2A6*10*. Following *CYP2A6* gene (9.2 kb) amplification the products were cloned and then genotyped or sequenced to determine whether 6458A>T is in haplotype with the SNPs in *CYP2A6*7* and *CYP2A6*10*.\n\n### CYP2A6 genotyping and phenotyping\n\nIndividuals from different ethnic backgrounds, African Canadian (n=279), African American (n=617), Japanese (n=60), Taiwanese (n=167), Chinese (n=98), and Caucasian (n=152) were genotyped for the 6458A>T variant. In addition, the African Americans and African Canadians were genotyped for other *CYP2A6* variants including *CYP2A6*1B*, **2*, **4*, **9*, **12*, **14*, **17*, **20*, **21*, **23*, **24*, **25*, **26*, **27*, and **28*), while the Taiwanese, Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasians were genotyped for *CYP2A6*1B*, **2*, **4*, **7*, **8*, **9*, **10*, and **12*. The demographics of the African Canadian, African American, Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Caucasian populations have been previously described.^5, 40, 41^\n\nPhenotypic measures were available for the African Canadian and African American populations. The plasma 3HC/COT ratio collected at 270 min following oral nicotine (4 mg capsule) was used as a proxy measure for CYP2A6 activity among the African Canadians,^41^ while the plasma 3HC/COT ratio collected from *ad libitum* smoking was used in the African American population.^10^ In both populations *CYP2A6* genotype has been shown to be significantly associated with the ratio (3HC/COT), supporting its use as a measure of CYP2A6 activity.^15, 42^ All studies were approved by the University of Toronto ethics board.\n\n### Construction and expression of CYP2A6 constructs in E. coli\n\nA bicistronic construct containing the full length cDNA of *CYP2A6* followed by the human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (*hNPR*) inserted into a pCW expression vector was generously provided by Dr. E. Gillam.^43, 44^ Two amino acid substitutions V110L and N438Y were introduced either alone or in combination to create CYP2A6.V110L, CYP2A6.35 (Asn438Tyr), and CYP2A6.24 (Val110Leu + Asn438Tyr), respectively. The commercial kits QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis and QuickChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis were used to introduce the single and multiple amino acid substitutions respectively according to manufacturer’s directions (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, USA). Primers used to introduce Val110Leu (CYP2A6.V110L) were 2A6_594G>C and 2A6_594G>C Anti ([table 4](#T4)). Asn438Tyr (CYP2A6.35) was introduced using the primers 2A6_6458A>T and 2A6_6458A>T Anti ([table 4](#T4)). The combination of 2A6_594G>C Anti and 2A6_6458A>T Anti were used to construct CYP2A6.24 (Val110Leu+Asn438Tyr). Introduction of the correct changes to the variant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. In addition, a construct with 802 bp deleted from the CYP2A6 cDNA (CYP2A6.NEG) was used as a negative control, while a CYP2A6.17 construct served as a positive control.^44^ All five variant constructs (CYP2A6.NEG, CYP2A6.17, CYP2A6.V110L, CYP2A6.35, and CYP2A6.24) in addition to the wildtype CYP2A6 (CYP2A6.1) were expressed in *E. coli* and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously.^44^ Membrane protein content was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Labs, Mississauga, Canada) and the amount of CYP2A6 protein was determined by immunoblotting with a monoclonal CYP2A6 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON) as described previously.^44^\n\n### In vitro nicotine assay\n\nNicotine C-oxidation activity was assessed as previously described with minor modifications.^44^ The reaction mixture (final volume of 0.5 ml) contained *E. coli* membrane preparations (10 pmol CYP2A6), 20 nmol/l of expressed cytochrome b_5_ (Invitrogen; Burlington, Canada), 50 mmol/l Tris-HCL buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/l NADPH (Sigma-Aldrich; Oakville, Canada), nicotine substrate (ranging from 2–100 μM), and 1.0 mg protein/ml human liver cytosol (added in excess so that CYP-mediated oxidation would be rate limiting). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mmol/l NADPH following a 2 min preincubation at 37°C. After 15 min incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μM of Na_2_CO_3_. Cotinine formation was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography as described previously.^45^ Cotinine formation increased linearly with CYP2A6 protein concentrations (5–70 pmoles) and time (5–30 min) at 100 and 500 μM of nicotine (data not shown). The minimal amounts of cotinine detected in the reaction with CYP2A6.NEG were used as baseline correction to control for any contamination of the substrate or cotinine formation by the *E. coli* system. The kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) were estimated from the high affinity site using the Michaelis-Menten equation in the computer program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., version 5.0 for windows)\n\n### In vitro thermal stability assay\n\nTo test the thermal stability of the different CYP2A6 constructs, *E. coli* membrane preparations were incubated at 37°C for 24 hrs. The experiment was carried out twice independently. On one day, single aliquots were collected, while on the other day duplicate aliquots were collected. Data was consistent within and between days. Aliquots were taken at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hrs to measure nicotine C-oxidation activity. Activity assays were carried out with 30 μM of nicotine as described above. In addition, aliquots were taken at 0, 8, 12, and 24 hrs to measure CYP2A6 protein levels by immunoblotting.\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using Chi-square, or Fisher’s exact test if five or fewer individuals were in one genotype group. Since gender and smoking status significantly influence the 3HC/COT ratio in the African Canadian population ^46^ and other populations,^47–49^ we controlled for gender and smoking. The African American population were all smokers, thus we only controlled for gender. Throughout the manuscript the 3HC/COT ratio is presented as the mean adjusted value. The adjustment for the impact of gender and smoking status was made as previously described.^15^ Briefly, the metabolic ratio for each individual was adjusted by dividing the 3HC/COT value with the overall mean from their respective group. For example, the 3HC/COT of each female nonsmoker was divided by the overall mean of their respective group (i.e. female nonsmokers). The mean adjusted ratios were not used in any statistical analyses. Instead we used the raw 3H/COT values and controlled for the effects of gender and smoking using a regression model. We adopted a forward stepwise regression strategy in which gender and/or smoking status were in the first block and *CYP2A6* genotype in the second block. The reference for *CYP2A6* genotype in the regression analyses were those with wildtype genotype (*CYP2A6*1/*1*) and the dependent variable was log 3HC/COT. The wildtype genotype group (*CYP2A6*1/*1*) included individuals with undetected *CYP2A6* variants and the wild-type variant *CYP2A6*1B*. The *CYP2A6*1B* allele was included in the wildtype group (*CYP2A6*1/*1*) for two main reasons. Firstly, the SNPs in *CYP2A6*35* are found on the *CYP2A6*1B* background, meaning they are in linkage with the 58bp gene conversion found in *CYP2A6*1B* ([table 1](#T1)). Secondly, *CYP2A6*1B* is a wildtype allele usually included in the wildtype reference group in the literature^15, 18^, along with other variants of the *CYP2A6*1* allele (*CYP2A6*1B* to**1K,* listed at [http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2a6.htm](http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2a6.htm)). In order to compare the impact *CYP2A6*35* to other variants in the literature we have included the individuals with *CYP2A6*1B* in the wildtype (*CYP2A6*1/*1*) group. The 3HC/COT values were log normalized as the 3HC/COT values were not normally distributed.\n\n*In vitro* kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km, Vmax/Km) of the variant CYP2A6 constructs were compared to the wildtype CYP2A6 construct using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. The half-life (t_1/2_) for the thermally induced loss of CYP2A6 activity was determined according to the one phase decay equation (GraphPad Prism Version 5). The t_1/2_ values reported herein are a measure of the thermal activity of the enzyme as previously determined ^17, 50^ and not the t_1/2_ of the CYP2A6 protein. Time courses of multiple experiments performed were analyzed in concert to obtain the value of the rate of decay *k*; which was subsequently used to determine the half life (t_1/2_ = ln2/k). By fixing the value of *k* obtained for the wildtype (CYP2A6.1), the changes in the absolute sum of squares of the variant constructs were compared to their baseline fits to determine the level of significance. All analyses were performed on the collected data, while the data were normalized as the percentage remaining activity for presentation. All p-values are one tailed with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., version 15.0 for Windows) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., version 5.0 for windows).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) MOP86471, and CA91912 (JSA).

Variability of the acute bronchodilator response in asthmatic individuals exists [[3](#R3)]. Findings from genetic studies of candidate genes (e.g. beta-2 adrenergic receptor (*ADRB2)* [[4](#R4)], [[5](#R5)], [[6](#R6)], [[7](#R7)], [[8](#R8)], [[9](#R9)], [[10](#R10)] and adenylate cyclase 9 (*ADCY9)* [[11](#R11)]) and bronchodilator response have provided evidence of a genetic component in inter-individual variability.\n\nIn this study, we hypothesize that genetic variants of *CRHR2* are associated with acute airway bronchodilator response upon β_2_ AR agonists administration in asthmatic individuals. The logic in looking at the CRHR2 gene as an indicator of bronchodilator response to beta agonists comes from 2 lines of evidence: (1) Similar smooth muscle relaxation mechanism between the beta-2 agonist and CRHR2 pathways. Agonists produce bronchodilation in asthmatics by binding to and directly simulating the β_2_ AR on airway smooth muscle cells. The interaction of agonist and receptor leads to multiple downstream signals, one of which is the activation of adenylyl cyclase via stimulatory G proteins, which in turn increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates several target proteins, decreases intracellular calcium cations, and leads to smooth muscle relaxation [[2](#R2)]. Similar to β_2_ AR, CRHR2 belongs to the family of G protein coupled – receptors (GPCRs). CRHR2 and its homologue, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), signal mainly through G proteins to increase adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP levels. In mice, CRHR1 and CRHR2 have been found to be expressed in airway epithelium and smooth muscle relaxation response was induced by urocrotin (UCN) III – CRHR2 mediated cAMP elevation [[12](#R12)]. In rats, UCN mRNA was expressed in lung tissues in non-allergically sensitized animals and was expressed more pronouncedly in their sensitized counterparts [[13](#R13)]. By interacting with its ligands (UCN-I, II, III and CRH), CRHR2 may initiate various downstream signaling pathways (e.g. cAMP/PKA and MLC_20_ phosphorylation) to elicit contractile/relaxation responses in airway smooth muscles. (2) Interactions between beta-2 agonist and corticosteroid pathways. In vitro study has shown that β2AR mRNA level is elevated in the presence glucocorticoid [[11](#R11)]. CRHR2 signaling pathways regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis [[14](#R14)]. Animal models have suggested an important role of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system in airways [[12](#R12)], [[13](#R13)]. Since CRHR2 modulates the release of corticosterone [[14](#R14)], [[15](#R15)], asthmatic individuals with different genetic variants of CRHR2 may have different endogenous levels of corticosterone, leading to different degrees of interaction with beta-2 agonist in the airways.\n\nThe *CRHR2* gene is located on genomic region 7p21-p15 [[16](#R16)] and spans roughly 50 thousand base-pairs (Kbp) [[17](#R17)]. The gene consists of 12 exons; alternate splicing of exon 1 gives rise to 3 isoforms (CRHR2α, β and γ)[[18](#R18)]. Animal and human expression studies suggested that CRHR2α and CRHR2β are expressed in both the brain and the periphery such as smooth muscle and CRHR2γ predominantly expressed in the brain (reviewed in [[19](#R19)]). Our aim is to identify genetic variants of *CRHR2* contributing to variability in acute bronchodilator response in asthmatic individuals.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Primary study population\n\nThe study population consisted of asthma patients enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of inhaled steroid versus non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent versus placebo over a mean of 4.3 years ([[20](#R20)], [[21](#R21)]). Briefly, children ages 5 to 12 years who suffered from mild to moderate asthma were recruited based on criteria including (1) asthma symptoms and/or (2) medication use for ≥ 6 months in the previous year and (3) at least a 20% reduction in FEV_1_ after the administration of methacholine at a concentration less than or equal to 12.5 mg/ml (PC_20_ ≤ 12.5mg/ml). Pulmonary function including bronchodilator responses and airway responsiveness was measured before randomization. For this study, acute bronchodilator response at baseline (i.e. before randomization) was the phenotype of interest, measured as the percent change in FEV_1_ after the administration of 2 puffs of albuterol, compared with FEV_1_ measured immediately prior to albuterol administration. Subjects were asked to cease all bronchodilator medications for at least 12 hours before the measurement of responsiveness. Data on acute bronchodilator response prior to randomization to different treatment arms from 607 Caucasian subjects were analyzed for genetic association. Approval by the Institutional Review Board was obtained and informed consents from all subjects were received.\n\n### Replication study populations\n\nThe first replication cohort consisted of asthma patients enrolled in an adult study of β_2_ – agonist conducted by Sepracor Inc (Marlborough, MA), hereafter named Sepracor. A total of 427 subjects, who were over the age of 18, Caucasians, and had the full range of asthma severity were assessed for associations [[22](#R22)], including spirometry and bronchodilator responsiveness. The second replication cohort consisted of individuals enrolled in a completed trial conducted by the American Lung Association Asthma Clinical Research Centers (ALA-ACRC) to evaluate the effectiveness of low dose Theophylline as add-on treatment in asthma (the LODO trial), as described previously [[23](#R23)]. Briefly, the LODO trial was a multi-center, randomized, double-masked and placebo-controlled trial. Inclusion criteria include 15 years of age of older, a history of physician-diagnosed asthma, daily asthma medications use for 1 year or more, an FEV_1_ of 50% or more of predicted value, and poor asthma control as defined by a score of 1.5 of greater on the Asthma Control Questionnaire [[24](#R24)], [[25](#R25)]. Exclusion criteria include use of oral corticosteroid, leukotriene antagonists, or theophylline within 4 weeks before enrollment, and current or former smokers with 20 packyears or more smoking history. For the purpose of replication, data from 152 Caucasian subjects were analyzed for associations. Similar to the dosage used to measure acute bronchodilator response in CAMP, acute bronchodilator response at baseline prior to randomization were obtained by measuring the change in FEV_1_ after administration of 2 inhalations (90μg) of albuterol by metered dose inhaler. Approval by the Institutional Review Board was obtained and informed consents from all subjects in the two replication cohorts were received.\n\n### SNPs genotyping and statistical analyses\n\nWe investigated 39kb of genomic DNA harboring *CRHR2*, spanning from chromosome 7 position 30697689 to 30658511 on build 36.1 genome assembly released by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A total of 28 SNPs were selected from public databases, prior to the availability of the HapMap database, for investigation in CAMP in order to cover the genomic region of *CRHR2* based on physical location and compatibility with genotyping methods. Subsequent investigation of the HapMap Release 22 data showed that there are 7 SNPs which tag (tagging SNPs) the region with r^2^≥0.8 in the CEU population, and these tagging SNPs were in the original 28 SNPs panel. SNP genotyping was performed using standard protocol for the iplex assay on Sequenom MassARRAY MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (26) (Sequenom, CA, USA) and TaqMan assays (27) (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Multivariate associations between individual SNP and acute bronchodilator response in the presence of potential confounders (height, age, gender, and baseline FEV_1_ pre-bronchodilator administration) were tested using general linear model. Genotypes were coded for association testing under an additive model. SNP characteristics (e.g. allele frequency, Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium) for each SNP were assessed using the software Haploview [[28](#R28)].\n\nHaplotype analyses were conducted using the software *haplo.stats* [[29](#R29)]. To narrow the genomic region (e.g. lengths of haplotype blocks) within the 32kb region that was associated with the phenotype, the sliding window option was used to test for associations between haplotypes of length 2 to 10 SNPs and acute bronchodilator response, adjusted for potential confounders. All p-values were obtained from simulation with default values of 1000 replicates. Simulated p-value is the number of times the simulated score statistic, calculated from a permutated-reordering of the trait and covariates and the original ordering of the genotyping matrix, exceeds the observed, divided by the total number of simulations.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Populations Baseline characteristics\n\nA total of 607 Caucasian CAMP subjects with the mean age of 8.86 years (standard deviation (sd) = 2.13 years) were analyzed in this study ([Table 1](#T1)). The mean age of onset was 3.06 years (sd = 2.44 years). The male to female ratio was 1.5:1.0. The mean bronchodilator response was 10.75% (sd = 10.13%). In Sepracor, a total of 427 Caucasian asthmatic subjects with the mean age of 32.55 years (sd = 13.72 years) were analyzed. The male to female ratio was 1:1 and the mean bronchodilator response was 40.36% (sd = 20.98%). In LODO, a total of 152 Caucasian asthmatic subjects with the mean age of 42.84 years (sd = 14.77 years) were analyzed. The male to female ratio was 0.33:1 and the mean bronchodilator response was 9.68% (sd = 11.13%). We have confined our analyses to Caucasians to avoid potential confounding due to population substructures. In addition, power to detect associations in other racial groups is low due to small sample sizes.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | CAMP | SEPRACOR | LODO |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Number of subjects | 607 | 427 | 152 |\n| Age (yrs), mean (sd) | 8.86 (2.13) | 32.55 (13.72) | 42.88 (14.74) |\n| Age (yrs), range | 5.17-13.24 | 12-80 | 15-76 |\n| Age at first asthma symptoms (yrs), mean (sd) | 3.06 (2.43) | not available | not available |\n| Male gender count (frequency) | 364 (0.60) | 214 (0.50) | 38 (0.25) |\n| Female gender count (frequency) | 243 (0.40) | 213 (0.50) | 114 (0.75) |\n| Baseline pre - bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted (sd) | 94.52 (14.06) | 54.95 (7.76) | 68.07 (14.31) |\n| Baseline post - bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted (sd) | 103.55 (12.51) | 76.58 (12.65) | 73.91 (13.78) |\n| Baseline brochodilator response % (sd) | 10.75 (10.13) | 40.36 (20.98) | 9.67 (11.07) |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Population characteristics\n\n### SNP Characteristics\n\nA total of 28 SNPs were investigated in CAMP ([Figure 1](#F1), [Table 2](#T2)). Minor allele frequencies range from 1.9% to 39.0%. The average frequency of missing genotypes for the 28 SNPs was 4.0% (ranges from 1.15 - 11.37% (rs733453)). In Sepracor, 26 of the 28 SNPs tested in CAMP were analyzed. Minor allele frequencies range from 1.9% to 40.4% ([Table 2](#T2)). The average missing genotype rate was 3.1% (0 – 11.2% (rs2014663)). In LODO, 23 of the 28 SNPs were analyzed. Minor allele frequencies range from 0.70% to 48.4% ([Table 2](#T2)). The average missing genotype rate was 6.1% (0 - 13.1% (rs2284217)). Across all 3 cohorts, only 4 variants (rs733453, rs917195, rs929377 and rs1076291) were marginally out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (0.03 ≤ p-value ≤ 0.05), as expected by chance given the number of SNPs tested.\n\n### Figure 1.

Minor alleles rs255100A, rs7793837T and rs2267715G were associated with reduced bronchodilator response. Haplotypes of length ranging from 2 to 10 SNPs were analyzed for associations and a total of 2 haplotype blocks of lengths 2 and 4 SNPs demonstrated significant associations under an additive model (simulated global p-value < 0.05) ([Figure 2A](#F2)). Of the 3 associated SNPs, rs255100 and rs2267715 are in strong linkage disequilibrium (r^2^ = 0.88), rs255100 and rs7793837, and rs7793837 and rs2267715 are in moderate linkage disequilibrium (r^2^ = 0.48 and 0.40, respectively) (data not shown). Haplotypes of each associated blocks were further assessed for associations and a common haplotype (rs7793837A-rs4723002A-rs1003929C-rs2284220A (frequency = 0.60)) demonstrated the most significant association (simulated p-value = 0.026) ([Figure 2B](#F2)).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   | CAMP |  |  | SEPRACOR |  |  | LODO |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Variants | Count (freq) | mean (se) | p-value | Count (freq) | mean (se) | p-value | Count (freq) | mean (se) | p-value |\n| rs255100 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| TT | 221 (0.36) | 11.70 (0.54) | 0.02 | 151 (0.35) | 40.49 (2.33) | 0.78 | 61 (0.40) | 11.23 (1.35) | 0.38 |\n| TA | 287 (0.47) | 10.82 (0.48) |   | 209 (0.49) | 39.91 (1.32) |   | 71 (0.47) | 8.43 (1.15) |   |\n| AA | 88 (0.15) | 9.22 (0.87) |   | 67 (0.16) | 40.93 (1.55) |   | 20 (0.13) | 10.09 (2.13) |   |\n| missing | 11 (0.02) |   |   | 0 (0.00) |   |   | 0 (0.00) |   |   |\n| rs7793837 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AA | 349 (0.57) | 11.33 (0.44) | 0.05 | 235 (0.55) | 39.04 (1.23) | 0.24 | 75 (0.49) | 11.46 (1.08) | 0.03 |\n| AT | 207 (0.34) | 10.07 (0.57) |   | 155 (0.36) | 41.98 (1.52) |   | 55 (0.36) | 7.34 (1.26) |   |\n| TT | 40 (0.07) | 9.62 (1.29) |   | 31 (0.07) | 40.41 (3.40) |   | 8 (0.05) | 8.34 (3.35) |   |\n| missing | 13 (0.02) |   |   | 6 (0.01) |   |   | *14 (0.09) |   |   |\n| rs2284220 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AA | 402 (0.66) | 10.82 (0.40) | 0.9 | 311 (0.73) | 41.08 (1.06) | 0.03 | 111 (0.73) | 9.34 (0.92) | 0.52 |\n| AG | 141 (0.23) | 11.57 (0.68) |   | 103 (0.24) | 37.97 (1.84) |   | 27 (0.18) | 11.88 (1.91) |   |\n| GG | 10 (0.02) | 6.67 (2.69) |   | 5 (0.01) | 20.86 (8.40) |   | 5 (0.03) | 8.07 (4.37) |   |\n| missing | 54 (0.09) |   |   | 8 (0.02) |   |   | 9 (0.06) |   |   |\n| rs2267716 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| TT | 361 (0.60) | 11.23 (0.43) | 0.1 | 246 (0.58) | 40.04 (1.22) | 0.84 | 82 (0.54) | 11.34 (1.11) | 0.05 |\n| TC | 203 (0.33) | 10.09 (0.57) |   | 151 (0.35) | 41.25 (1.56) |   | 53 (0.35) | 7.11 (1.38) |   |\n| CC | 33 (0.05) | 9.91 (1.41) |   | 26 (0.06) | 38.83 (3.78) |   | 5 (0.03) | 10.43 (4.71) |   |\n| missing | 10 (0.02) |   |   | 4 (0.01) |   |   | *12 (0.08) |   |   |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Significant associations of CRHR2 genotypes and acute bronchodilator response in CAMP and replication cohorts\n\n### Figure 2.

(B) Haplotypes within the associated blocks were further assessed for association. Hap-scores are the score statistics calculated from Haplo.stats. Only haplotypes with significant (simulated) p-values were listed.\n\nIn Sepracor, none of the associated variants in CAMP was associated with acute bronchodilator response. A different variant, rs2284220, was associated with the phenotype (p-value = 0.03) ([Figure 3A](#F3)). The minor allele (rs2284220G) was associated with reduced bronchodilator response ([Table 3](#T3)). A total of 3 haplotype blocks of length 2, 7 and 8 SNPs demonstrated significant associations (simulated global p-value < 0.05) ([Figure 3A](#F3)). Further assessment for associations within each block showed that haplotype rs4723002A-rs1003929T (frequency = 0.13) was associated with the phenotype with the most statistical significance (simulated p-value = 0.003), followed by haplotype rs255102A-rs255100A-rs917195C-rs7793837A-rs4723002A-rs1003929T-rs2284220G (frequency = 0.10, simulated p-value = 0.008) ([Figure 3B](#F3)). In LODO, variants rs7793837 and rs2267716 were associated with acute bronchodilator response (p-value ≤ 0.05) ([Figure 4A](#F4)). The minor alleles (rs7793837T and rs2267716C) were associated with reduced bronchodilator response ([Table 3](#T3)). The two SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium (r^2^ = 0.87). A 2-SNP haplotype block was associated with the phenotype (simulated global p-value = 0.05) and further assessment of individual haplotypes within this block showed that haplotype rs4723002A-rs7793837A (frequency = 0.75) was the most significantly associated (simulated p-value = 0.02, respectively) with acute bronchodilator response ([Figure 4B](#F4)).\n\n### Figure 3.

In our primary and two replication cohorts, different SNPs of *CRHR2* were found to be associated with acute bronchodilator response to albuterol, however, the physical proximity of these SNPs with each other (between exon β1a and exon 3) suggests that the causative variant(s) may reside towards the 5’ end of the gene. By comparing the haplotypes showing the most significant associations in each cohort, the associated region spans approximately 8.7kb between introns β1b and 2 ([Table 4](#T4)). The haplotype analyses detected the common haplotypes (frequency between 60% - 78%) to be associated with acute bronchodilator response in the three cohorts. The haplotypes are of different length, yet in CAMP and LODO, allele rs7793837A resides in almost all the associated common haplotypes. In Sepracor, the associated haplotype with a frequency of 78% consisted of 2 neighboring SNPs (rs4723002 and rs1003929) 1 and 7 kb downstream of variant rs7793837. We speculated that variant rs7793837 was associated in Sepracor because (1) it is not the causative variant but in LD with the causative variant, and (2) Sepracor is phenotypically different from CAMP and LODO. This cohort has a higher mean bronchodilator response due to the recruitment requirement of subjects with >15% bronchodilator response (Sepracor: -40.98% (standard deviation of 20.98), CAMP:10.75 (sd 10.13) and LODO: 9.67 (sd 11.07)). A different causative variant, also residing at 5’ end of CRHR2 may be responsible for the association observed in Sepracor. This 5’ region encodes the N-terminal extracellular domain of CRHR2, where interactions with ligands occur (reviewed in [[19](#R19)]). In addition to encoding the N-terminal, this region houses multiple exons 1 (β1b, γ1 and α1), where various isoforms of CRHR2 are translated depending on the splicing transcripts being translated [[19](#R19)]. Additional sequencing of the 5’ end of *CRHR2* was carried out to identify the causative variant(s). Approximately 32 kb of genomic regions (exons β1a, β1b, γ1, α1, 2 and flanking intronic regions) were sequenced in 48 CAMP subjects, revealing 3 novel intronic variants located 199bp upstream and 26 and 74bp downstream of exon β1a, respectively. Two of the 3 novel variants were chosen for their potential functions and were genotyped in a subset of CAMP subjects, but no association was observed with acute bronchodilator response (data not shown). Although the original 28 SNPs panel did not cover exon β1a, subsequent sequencing and genotyping efforts ensured exon β1a and surrounding intronic regions were investigated.\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| cohort | rs7793837 | rs4723002 | rs1003929 | rs2284220 | frequency | hap-score | simulated p-value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CAMP | A | A | C | A | 0.6 | 2.29 | 0.026 |\n| SEPRACOR |   | A | T |   | 0.13 | -2.7 | 0.003 |\n| LODO | A | A |   |   | 0.74 | 2.28 | 0.019 |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Haplotypes demonstrating the most significant association with acute bronchodilator response in CAMP, SEPRACOR and LODO\n\nThe rationale for testing for associations in both pediatric and childhood asthma cohorts is to establish generalization of the associations between *CRHR2* genetic variants and acute bronchodilator response across different age groups; to determine whether the association was a developmental, an aging, or both a developmental and aging phenomenon in the lungs. Our findings that different SNPs were associated with acute bronchodilator response in the three cohorts and that these SNPs reside at the 5’ end of *CRHR2* suggest that the associations observed are likely due to linkage disequilibrium between associated SNPs and the true phenotype causing variant(s), in both childhood and adult asthma.\n\nThe 5’ end of *CRHR2* is of great biological interest. The CRHR2 protein has 3 isoforms (CRHR2α, CRHR2β, and CRHR2γ) which differ at the N termini, and are encoded by the 5’ end exons of *CRHR2*. Translations of exon β1a and exon β1b encode the N terminus of the CRHR2β isoform, and exon 1α and 1γ encode the N termini of CRHR2α and CRHR2γ, respectively [[18](#R18)]. *In vitro* study has demonstrated that the three isoforms have different downstream signaling capacities [[18](#R18)]. We speculate that the causative variant(s) may influence acute bronchodilator response through regulating translations of *CRHR2* into various isoforms.\n\nHow genetic variations in *CRHR2* function contribute to differential responses to β2-agonist remains to be investigated. Literature has presented complex interactions between β2 AR and other signaling pathways, based on which we propose three molecular mechanisms that could potentially explain the association of *CRHR2* variants with bronchodilator response. First, CRHR2 signaling may desensitize β2 AR function in asthmatics. β2 AR signaling can be desensitized not only by its own activation but also by signaling through other G protein-coupled receptors. This cross-talk, which is referred to as heterologous desensitization (versus homologous desensitization by its own signaling), has been observed between β2 AR and PGE2 receptors [[30](#R30)]. This mechanism predicts that individuals with higher CRHR2 signaling capacity may have reduced bronchodilator response due to stronger cross-desensitization. A second mechanism takes into consideration the documented anti-inflammatory role of CRHR2 [[12](#R12)]. In this case, reduced CRHR2 function may lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, many of which will down-regulate the signaling through β2 ARs [[31](#R31)]. The last mechanism concerns the possible synergistic interaction between CRHR2 and β2 AR since both of them relax smooth muscles by stimulating cAMP production. If synergistic contribution from CRHR2 is pivotal for β2 agonists to achieve effective bronchoprotection in asthmatics, patients carrying CRHR2 alleles that have lower biological activities will have dampened therapeutic response to β2 agonists. Synergy between G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been demonstrated in many biological systems where activation of one GPCR can amplify the signaling events in a parallel but separate pathway [[32](#R32)], [[33](#R33)]. To determine which one of these three proposed paradigms is valid, we need to perform physiological studies on mice that were engineered to be CRHR2-deficient as well as biochemical analysis of signaling interaction between CRHR2 and β2 AR in primary airway smooth muscle cells.\n\nThis study has limitations. First, we did not detect a single SNP that was associated across the 3 cohorts. Second, the significant associations detected would not reach significance level when corrected for multiple testing. However, in spite of these limitations, we felt that by detecting associations with SNPs covering a region within the gene across 3 populations, the findings that CRHR2, as a gene, is associated with acute bronchodilator response is likely to be valid. The lack of any single SNP being associated in all three cohorts suggests that the genetic effect of CRHR2, although present, is likely to be weak. Being a complex trait, the number of genetic variants explaining inter-individual variations in bronchodilator response is likely to be high, with each variant exerts low to moderate effect. Our findings suggests that genetic variants of *CRHR2*, in addition to the widely studied *β2AR* and many yet to be characterized genetic variants, influence acute bronchodilator response to short acting β2A. Despite our subsequent sequencing and genotyping effort of exons at the 5’ end of *CRHR2,* we did not detect any causative variants, hence, the causative variants are likely to be in untranslated regions. Additional exploration of the region will be needed to identify the causative variants affecting acute bronchodilator response so that subsequent screening tests can be developed to predict in advance the efficacy of administering β_2_ agonists as an asthma treatment in asthmatic individuals.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all families for their enthusiastic participation in the CAMP Genetics Ancillary Study, supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NO1-HR-16049.

Three methods are used to deliver FU: bolus infusional intravenous administration, and oral capecitabine, a prodrug that undergoes preferential conversion to FU in malignant tissue. Oxaliplatin or irinotecan can be added to FU in combination regimens that include infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)^1^; capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX)^2^; and fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI).^3^ Depending on the regimen used, 10% to 30% of patients suffer substantial FU toxicities (grade ≥ 3), typically diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, mucositis/stomatitis, myelosuppression, and hand-foot syndrome (HFS). Overall, FU causes 0.5% to 1.0% mortality (grade 5).^4,5^ Consequently, attention has focused on the identification of biomarkers or assays predictive of FU toxicity.^6,7^\n\nFU metabolism involves many enzyme reactions and intermediates (Data Supplement [online only]). Although measurement of enzyme activities could be used for toxicity prediction, these assays may be too cumbersome and expensive for routine, large-scale use. After initial reports linking severe dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) deficiency with lethal FU use,^8^ many genetic polymorphisms and rare variants in FU metabolism genes have been reported to influence the risk of adverse events.^9–11^ In theory, by testing a panel of polymorphisms, FU toxicities can be predicted and dose modifications considered. However, the existing published data are limited by inconsistency in reporting and testing toxicities, pooling of patients on different FU schedules, and combined analysis of functionally distinct polymorphisms within the same gene. Several polymorphisms lacking validation may have been included in commercial FU toxicity kits.\n\nGiven the uncertainty regarding which genetic variants are truly predictive of adverse events from FU, we have examined associations between candidate polymorphisms and capecitabine toxicity in patients from the Quick and Simple and Reliable trial (QUASAR2). We have then performed a meta-analysis combining these data with those from previously published studies, both of capecitabine and other FU schedules.\n\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\n\nA synopsis of the methods used is presented here. Full details are provided in the Data Supplement.\n\nThe QUASAR2 study was the basis of our analysis of genetic markers of capecitabine toxicity. QUASAR2 is a phase III randomized trial of adjuvant capecitabine ± bevacizumab after resection of stage II/III colorectal cancer. We obtained data from 927 patients from the QUASAR2 trial for common FU-related toxicities—diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, mucositis/stomatitis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and HFS. Adverse toxicity events were categorized as high (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grades 3, 4, or 5 during any treatment cycle) or low (grades 0, 1, or 2). A global toxicity measure was derived based on the presence of any grade 3/4/5 event (high) or absence of any such event (low).\n\nFrom a systematic literature review (Data Supplement), we identified 36 FU-pathway polymorphisms potentially suitable for analysis ([Table 1](#T1); Data Supplement). QUASAR2 genotypes were derived from Illumina (San Diego, CA) SNP arrays, individual polymorphism typing assays, or genetic imputation as long as high-quality results were obtained (Data Supplement). Twenty-one polymorphisms were included in the final analysis, after quality control and the exclusion of variants in strong pairwise linkage disequilibrium.

For every polymorphism in the meta-analysis (those analyzed for QUASAR2 plus *CES2*6046G>A, *CES2*6320G>A, *CDA*−205C>G, *CDA*rs602950, *CDA*943insC, *CDA*575C>T, *CDA*794G>A, *CDA*771 C>G, *UMPS*1336A>G, *TYMP*A324A, *TYMS*5′VNTR3RG>C, *DPYD*623G>A, *DPYD*1109delTA, *DPYD*1679T>G, and *DPYD*2858G>C), we performed an allelic test of association with global toxicity (grades 0/1/2 *v* 3/4/5) in each set of patients who had received the same regimen. For each FU regimen, meta-analyses assessing the relationship between toxicity (global and individual) and each individual polymorphism were performed using the metan command in STATA (STATA, College Station, TX). SEs and log(risk ratio) from each study were combined using the Mantel-Haenszel method.\n\nFor certain variants in *TYMS* and *DPYD*, we performed haplotype and/or set-based tests. The *TYMS*5′VNTR repeat haplotype with the G>CSNP in the second repeat was analyzed by a binary model based on the total number of USF1/USF2 binding sites across both alleles (0 to 2 *v* 3 to 4).^36^ The *TYMS*5′VNTR (2R *v* 3R) and 3′UTR polymorphisms, which are in moderate linkage disequilibrium, were analyzed in combination by logistic regression conditioned on study, formal haplotype analysis, and a score test in which toxicity was regressed on the number of *TYMS* toxicity risk alleles (0 to 4) summed from the 3′UTR and 5′VNTR polymorphisms. For *DPYD*, we grouped rare variants with effects on enzyme function (*DPYD**2A and 2846T>A) for analysis.\n\nFor our primary investigation of global toxicity, we used a false discovery rate of *q* < 0.05,^37^ corresponding to *P* < .0065 for the QUASAR2 analysis, *P* < .0033 for the capecitabine meta-analyses, and *P* < .0048 for the noncapecitabine meta-analyses. We refer to associations that achieve *q* < 0.05 as formally significant and those that achieve *P* < .05 as nominally significant. We also applied these thresholds to assessment of individual toxicities, because these are not independent of global toxicity.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Testing Candidate FU-Toxicity Variants in QUASAR2\n\nOf 927 patients on the QUASAR2 study, 301developed grade ≥ 3 global toxicity. The most frequent specific grade ≥ 3 toxicity was HFS (n = 206), followed by diarrhea (n = 97), and neutropenia (n = 19). Two patients died as a result of capecitabine-related toxicity; one as a result of respiratory failure second to neutropenia and the other as a result of neutropenic colitis and left ventricular hypertrophy. Three of the 21 polymorphisms were significantly associated with global G3+ toxicity at *q* < 0.05: *TYMS*5′VNTR2R (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; *P* = 7.2 × 10^−5^), *TYMS*3′UTR6bp ins (OR, 1.36; *P* = .0051), and *DPYD*2846A (OR, 9.35; *P* = .0043; [Table 2](#T2)). We found no formally significant effect of the other 18 previously reported FU variants on global or specific toxicities (Data Supplement).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Polymorphism and Toxicity | QUASAR2 Analyses |  |  |  |  | All Capecitabine Analyses |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No. of Patients | TAF | OR | 95% CI | P | No. of Studies | No. of Patients | OR | 95% CI | P | P-het |  |  |\n| TYMS5′VNTR2R/3R (2-repeat allele) |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 918 | 0.47 | 1.48 | 1.22 to 1.80 | .000079 | 5 | 1,300 | 1.36 | 1.15 to 1.60 | .00028 | .17 | Meta |\n| Diarrhea | 918 | 0.47 | 1.29 | 0.96 to 1.74 | .093 | 5 | 1,309 | 1.12 | 0.87 to 1.45 | .38 | .29 |  |\n| HFS | 916 | 0.47 | 1.44 | 1.15 to 1.79 | .0013 | 5 | 1,306 | 1.33 | 1.10 to 1.60 | .0029 | .23 |  |\n| TYMS3′UTR6bpins-del (6bp-insertion allele) |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 474 | 0.69 | 1.67 | 1.23 to 2.22 | .00084 | 4 | 738 | 1.35 | 1.07 to 1.70 | .012 | .024 | Meta |\n| Diarrhea | 474 | 0.69 | 1.49 | 0.94 to 2.38 | .085 | 4 | 745 | 1.11 | 0.79 to 1.58 | .54 | .007 |  |\n| HFS | 473 | 0.69 | 1.47 | 1.06 to 2.08 | .021 | 4 | 743 | 1.43 | 1.09 to 1.87 | .0091 | .34 |  |\n| 5′VNTR adjusted for 3′UTR |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 474 | 0.47 | 1.24 | 0.93 to 1.67 | .15 | 2 | 602 | 1.27 | 0.98 to 1.64 | .068 | — | Pooled |\n| Diarrhea | 474 | 0.47 | 1.08 | 0.70 to 1.67 | .72 | 2 | 602 | 1.11 | 0.76 to 1.61 | .59 | — |  |\n| HFS | 474 | 0.47 | 1.26 | 0.91 to 1.75 | .17 | 2 | 602 | 1.20 | 0.90 to 1.58 | .21 | — |  |\n| 3′UTR adjusted for 5′VNTR |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 474 | 0.69 | 1.56 | 1.11 to 2.18 | .010 | 2 | 602 | 1.42 | 1.06 to 1.89 | .017 | — | Pooled |\n| Diarrhea | 474 | 0.69 | 1.47 | 0.88 to 2.45 | .14 | 2 | 602 | 1.19 | 0.78 to 1.81 | .43 | — |  |\n| HFS | 474 | 0.69 | 1.37 | 0.94 to 1.98 | .10 | 2 | 602 | 1.40 | 1.02 to 1.93 | .038 | — |  |\n| TYMS score test (No. of high-risk alleles) |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 474 | 0.58 | 1.38 | 1.16 to 1.64 | .00031 | 2 | 602 | 1.33 | 1.15 to 1.55 | .00018 | .46 | Meta |\n| Diarrhea | 474 | 0.58 | 1.24 | 0.96 to 1.61 | .096 | 2 | 602 | 1.14 | 0.92 to 1.42 | .24 | .20 |  |\n| HFS | 474 | 0.58 | 1.31 | 1.08 to 1.59 | .0063 | 2 | 602 | 1.29 | 1.09 to 1.52 | .0030 | .73 |  |\n| DPYD*2A [exon skipping allele (A)] |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 905 | 0.004 | 2.78 | 0.62 to 12.5 | .18 | 2 | 1,035 | 3.02 | 0.78 to 11.7 | .11 | .83 | Meta |\n| Diarrhea | 905 | 0.004 | 1.41 | 0.17 to 11.8 | .75 | 2 | 1,035 | 3.14 | 0.71 to 13.8 | .13 | .18 |  |\n| HFS | 903 | 0.004 | 2.67 | 0.59 to 12.0 | .20 | 2 | 1,033 | 1.98 | 0.52 to 7.54 | .32 | .46 |  |\n| DPYD2846T>A (A allele) |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 881 | 0.006 | 9.35 | 2.01 to 43.4 | .0043 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Diarrhea | 881 | 0.006 | 3.14 | 0.82 to 11.9 | .093 |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| HFS | 879 | 0.006 | 1.31 | 0.35 to 4.96 | .69 |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| DPYD combined allelic model (2846A or *2AA allele) |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Global | 863 | 0.005 | 5.51 | 1.95 to 15.5 | .0013 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Diarrhea | 863 | 0.005 | 2.48 | 0.81 to 7.60 | .11 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| HFS | 861 | 0.005 | 1.76 | 0.66 to 4.71 | .26 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Associations Between Selected DPYD and TYMS Variants and Capecitabine-Related Toxicity\n\nThe 5′VNTR and 3′UTR*TYMS* polymorphisms are in moderate linkage disequilibrium (*r2* = 0.17; D′ = 0.64). In logistic regression analysis incorporating both variants, only the 5′VNTR polymorphism remained significantly associated with toxicity ([Table 2](#T2)). However, there was modest evidence from the logistic regression analysis that the 3′UTR genotype might have some independent association with toxicity (OR, 1.22; *P* = .10; [Table 2](#T2)), and a regression model with both 5′VNTR and 3′UTR had a slightly better fit to the data than a model with 5′VNTR alone (Aikake information criterion, 1,142 *v* 1,143). To capture the combined signal from the 5′VNTR and 3′UTR polymorphisms, we also tested a quantitative *TYMS* risk score (count, 0 to 4; according to the number of high-risk alleles per patient). The risk score was approximately normally distributed (*P* = .76, Shapiro-Wilk test) and strongly predicted global FU toxicity (OR_per count_, 1.33; *P* = 1.7 × 10^−5^; [Table 2](#T2); OR_score 3 or 4_ *v* _score 0_, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.94; *P* = .0032), providing a slightly improved fit (Aikake information criterion, 1,140) to the data.\n\nWe then analyzed the individual toxicities underlying the significant associations with global toxicity. The *TYMS* polymorphisms (score test) seemed to have similar effects on HFS (OR, 1.30; *P* = .00052) and diarrhea (OR, 1.24; *P* = .038), but the former toxicity was more common and hence contributed more to the global measure ([Table 2](#T2)). In contrast, the effects of *DPYD*2846A seemed more marked for diarrhea (OR, 3.14; *P* = .093) than for HFS (OR, 1.31; *P* = .69; [Table 2](#T2)).\n\n### Meta-Analysis of FU-Toxicity Variants\n\n#### Effect of variants on toxicity from capecitabine monotherapy.\n\nFifteen variants were analyzed for associations with global capecitabine toxicity (Data Supplement). The four studies additional to QUASAR2 comprised up to 382 patients. For *TYMS* and *DPYD2A*, the conclusions from the QUASAR2 analysis were maintained in the meta-analysis ([Table 2](#T2); [Fig 1](#F1)). We found no good evidence of an association between any other polymorphism and G3+ toxicity (Data Supplement).\n\n![Fig 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/baa3/4879695/058e33b79e37/zlj9991041190001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4879695_zlj9991041190001.jpg)\n\nForest plots of meta-analyses of selected (A) TYMS and (B) DPYD polymorphisms associated with global capecitabine toxicity. The analyses shown are for global grade ≥ 3 v grade 0 to 2 toxicities under a fixed-effects model. DPYD2846 is not shown because data were only available for the Quick and Simple and Reliable (QUASAR2) study. Horizontal lines show the 95% CIs. The size of the square is directly proportional to the amount of information contributed by the trial. The diamonds represent overall odds ratio (OR) for the included studies, with the center denoting the OR and the extremities the 95% CI.\n\n#### Effect of variants on toxicity from infusional FU monotherapy.\n\nFifteen variants were analyzed (Data Supplement), of which seven were present in single studies only. Only *TYMS* 5′VNTR2R met the formal significance threshold for association with global G3+ toxicity in the meta-analysis (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.85; *P* = .0035; Data Supplement). In an analysis adjusted for the 3′UTR6bp ins-del variant (Data Supplement), the 5′VNTR polymorphism remained associated with toxicity (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.04; *P* = .0040). The *TYMS* risk score was only nominally associated with toxicity (OR_per count_, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.45; *P* = .031). Analysis of individual adverse events suggested that the increased toxicity with the *TYMS*5′VNTR2R allele was primarily owing to diarrhea (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.08; *P* = .042).\n\nAlthough it did not reach the formal significance level for association, a substantial increased risk of global G3+ toxicity was suggested for the *DPYD**2A polymorphism (OR, 6.71; 95% CI, 1.66 to 27.1; *P* = .0075), mainly because of diarrhea (OR, 7.71; 95% CI, 1.61 to 36.9; *P* = .011). In a single-study analysis, the *DPYD*2846A allele showed a trend to greater G3+ toxicity, though this did not reach significance (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 0.28 to 34.4; *P* = .36). None of the other FU-toxicity variants analyzed showed significant associations with infusional FU toxicity.\n\n#### Effect of variants on toxicity from bolus FU monotherapy.\n\nThe only polymorphism significantly associated with global G3+ toxicity as a result of bolus FU was the *TYMS*3′UTR6bp ins allele (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.40; *P* = .00038), principally because of mucositis (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.08; *P* = .00086; Data Supplement). However, this association was not significant after adjusting for 5′VNTR alleles (Data Supplement). The *TYMS* risk score was a weaker predictor (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.71; *P* = .014).\n\nAlthough the *DPYD**2A variant did not meet the formal level of significance for association with global G3+ toxicity (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 0.95 to 15.6; *P* = .059), a substantial and significant increase in G3+ neutropenia was evident in patients who carried this variant (OR, 12.9; 95% CI, 3.13 to 53.3; *P* = .0004). As for infusional FU, patients who carried the *DPYD*2846A allele had trends to all types of toxicity. No other variant was significantly associated with bolus FU toxicity.\n\n### Combined Analysis of Rare DPYD Alleles With Evidence of Effects on Enzyme Function\n\nFor alleles within a single gene that have equivalent functional effects causally related to toxicity, it is justifiable to combine these into one functional class for predictive testing. For *DPYD*, some rare variants have been proposed to cause *DPYD* deficiency syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man No. 274270).^38,39^ Of these, a few have been shown to reduce DPYD activity in vitro,^40^ whereas others have lesser functional evidence from in vivo reports.^41,42^ Among variants found in our patient sets, we found good published evidence of functionality for *DPYD*2846A and *2A,^38,39^ but not for *9A (85T>C) or Ile370Val (1108A>G), despite these having previously been reported as causing *DPYD* deficiency (Data Supplement). We therefore performed an analysis of *DPYD*2846T>A and *2A rare alleles as a group (presence of either variant *v* no either variant). We found a formally significant association with global toxicity for capecitabine (OR, 5.51; 95% CI, 1.95 to 15.51; *P* = .0013; data from QUASAR2 alone; [Table 2](#T2)) and nominally significant associations in the analyses for infusional (*P* = .042) and bolus (*P* = .0068) monotherapies (Data Supplement). All of these associations were stronger than when either of the variants was considered alone. We noted that of the two patients who died from capecitabine-related toxicity in QUASAR2, one carried *DPYD*2846A and the other, *2A.\n\n### Prediction of Toxicity in FU Combination Therapy Regimens\n\nNone of the polymorphisms analyzed was associated with global or any specific toxicity in the combination therapy regimens (FOLFOX; CAPOX [capecitabine and oxaliplatin]; FOLFIRI; irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil [IFL or FLIRI]; Data Supplement). We note that *DPYD**2A was invariant and *DPYD*2846T>A was not analyzed in the available datasets. [Figure 2](#F2) shows the results from meta-analysis of the two main *TYMS* polymorphisms in studies using FOLFOX, the largest combination therapy data set.\n\n### Fig 2.\n\n![Fig 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/baa3/4879695/983debcfdb08/zlj9991041190002.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4879695_zlj9991041190002.jpg)\n\nForest plot of TYMS polymorphisms meta-analyzed in infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin patients.

These kits contain a total of 17 polymorphisms that fall into three categories: evidence of toxicity prediction in our analysis (n = 4), present in our analysis but without good evidence of predictive ability (n = 5), or absent from our analysis (n = 8). Of the variants that are absent from our analysis, five are rare *DPYD* variants with evidence of harmful effects on enzyme function [1679(*13), 1897(*3), 295-298del(*7), 703(*8), and 2983(*10); Data Supplement].^38,39^\n\nIn QUASAR2, we assessed the prediction of global toxicity by each kit, following the instructions as closely as possible, and using a binary classification of risk (no/low *v* moderate/intermediate/high). Owing to the inclusion of some common polymorphisms, two kits classified almost all patients as at-raised-risk of toxicity. One kit, however, provided better discrimination, with an area under the concentration-time curve of 0.56, 31% sensitivity, 82% specificity, 46% positive predictive value, and 70% negative predictive value (Data Supplement).\n\nWe then assessed whether we could improve on the performance of the kits using our *DPYD* combined rare functional alleles test and the *TYMS* score test ([Fig 3](#F3); Data Supplement). Although no fully independent data set was available for cross-validation, we minimized bias by applying effect size estimates from Caronia et al^33^ to QUASAR2 in a logistic regression model. Area under the concentration-time curve was 0.61. At our preferred ln(OR) cutoff of 0.762, sensitivity was 26%, specificity was 86%, positive predictive value was 49%, and negative predictive value was 70%.\n\n### Fig 3.\n\n![Fig 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/baa3/4879695/3e44bbf2960c/zlj9991041190003.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4879695_zlj9991041190003.jpg)\n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of the TYMS score test and DPYD group test for predicting global capecitabine toxicity in the Quick and Simple and Reliable (QUASAR2) trial capecitabine patients. Two sensitivity/specificity cut points are marked. Cut points at the bottom-left of the plot corresponds to the maximum proportion of patients correctly classified, with a sensitivity of 4.4%, specificity of 99%, positive predictive value of 73% (PPV; 95% CI, 45% to 91%), and negative predictive value of 68% (NPV; 95% CI, 64% to 71%), largely owing to rare DPYD variants. The other cut point (64% correctly classified) affects more patients as a result of utilizing TYMS genotypes and corresponds to a sensitivity of 26%, specificity of 86%, PPV of 49% (95% CI, 40% to 58%), and NPV of 70% (95% CI, 66% to 74%).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWe have provided the most comprehensive analysis to date of FU toxicity pharmacogenetics. We found that few genetic variants had convincing evidence of an association with toxicity. Of 36 previously assessed polymorphisms, only four—*TYMS* 5′VNTR 2R/3R, *TYMS* 3′UTR 6bpins-del, *DPYD* 2846TA, and *DPYD* *2A—were formally associated with global G3+ toxicity in our analysis. Even so, associations were only present in FU monotherapy regimens. The best evidence came from capecitabine monotherapy in the adjuvant setting although, even here, *TYMS*3′UTR6bp ins-del showed evidence of interstudy heterogeneity and we therefore relied on the larger capecitabine studies for our conclusions regarding this polymorphism. Studies of bolus and infusional FU generally supported the *TYMS* and *DPYD* data, although formally significant associations were less common. We found that formal cross-regimen analysis was not justifiable.\n\nThe *TYMS* risk alleles are common in the northern European population. We found the two *TYMS* polymorphisms to be partially independent toxicity predictors and both seem to provide useful information. Despite some inconsistent evidence that the *TYMS* alleles affect mRNA expression levels,^36,43^ they have not been shown to cause clinically significant differences in TYMS activity or thymidine incorporation into nucleic acids. Because the identity of the functional *TYMS* variation that causes toxicity is unknown, we have proposed the use of an ad hoc test in which each individual has a score of 0 to 4 according to the number of high-risk alleles they carry at the 5′VNTR and 3′UTR polymorphisms. The score test was a good predictor of global toxicity for capecitabine (OR, 1.33 per allele), with weaker evidence for infusional and bolus FU monotherapy.\n\nFor *DPYD*, the two variants associated with toxicity are rare, but for patients with *2A or 2846A, the risk is relatively high (OR, 5.51). We have proposed a group test in which, on the basis of enzyme function, patients carrying either *DPYD*2846A or *DPYD**2A are classed as being variant or wildtype. It is likely that other rare *DPYD* variants with functional effects equivalent to 2846A or *2A could be included in this test (Data Supplement).\n\nEvidence of an association with toxicity was weak for the remaining polymorphisms. Some of these (*DPYD*1627A>G, *DPYD*85T> C, *DPYD*496A>G, *TYMS*5′VNTRG>C, *MTHFR*677C>T, *MTHFR*1298A>C, *CDA*−451C>T, *CES2*823C>G, and the *TYMP* polymorphisms) have common alleles (MAF > 8%). Power to detect an association for these SNPs was approximately 75% to 100%, assuming an odds ratio of 1.5 per allele, and all but modest effects could therefore be excluded where sample sizes were relatively large. For other polymorphisms (eg, *DPYD*1601G>A, *DPYD*1236G>A, *DPYD*2194G>A, *CDA*943insC, and most *CES2* polymorphisms), minor allele frequencies were low or sample sizes small, leading to suboptimal power (approximately 20% to 40%) to detect an association. The case for these as markers of toxicity remains unproven.\n\nSeveral factors limited our ability to identify polymorphisms associated with FU toxicity. First, the different incidences of individual toxicity phenotypes among FU-based regimens required that we stratify the meta-analyses by FU regimen. This conservative approach decreased power, but prevented us from falsely combining data for toxicity events resulting from different sources. This method also required a larger number of tests, though most were not independent and we corrected for false discovery. Second, in the meta-analysis, there was a little evidence of publication bias; eight of 28 studies failed to provide ORs, and the absence of individual patient data meant that covariate-adjusted analyses were not generally possible. Third, there was no large capecitabine study to validate QUASAR2. Fourth, studies used different genotyping methods, although there was only good evidence of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in two *TYMS* 3′UTR data sets, which were subsequently excluded.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found that four specific germline *TYMS* and *DPYD* variants predict capecitabine toxicity. Although our analysis suggests that the polymorphisms may be predictive of toxicity in other FU monotherapy regimens, the data are currently less clear and these regimens are used uncommonly. We found no good evidence of polymorphisms that predict toxicity in patients on FU combination therapies, although no data were available for rare *DPYD* variants in this context. The lack of an association between either of the *TYMS* polymorphisms and toxicity in combination regimens is interesting and might reflect reduced FU dosage in these regimens, overlapping toxicities between drugs, confounding of FU toxicity by other more serious and/or early-onset toxicities, or suboptimal patient set sizes. Our findings strongly suggest the exclusion of several unwarranted polymorphisms from the currently available FU toxicity tests, leading to better performance at lower cost. Even then, a genetic test comprising the validated polymorphisms—two *TYMS* variants and functional *DPYD* variants—provides only modest predictive power. For genetic tests to be used in clinical practice, there is a need to identify and characterize additional FU toxicity variants. If such variants were added to the panel of polymorphisms identified in our study, a genetic test might well provide the ability to closely monitor patients who are at increased risk of toxicity or to increase FU dosage in those who are at low risk of toxicity.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## AUTHORS' DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nAlthough all authors completed the disclosure declaration, the following author(s) and/or an author's immediate family member(s) indicated a financial or other interest that is relevant to the subject matter under consideration in this article.

In contrast, the CYP2C9 genotype was not a significant predictor of the time to the first INR within the therapeutic range (P = 0.57) but was a significant predictor of the time to the first INR of more than 4 (P = 0.03).

The study outcomes were the time to the first INR within the therapeutic range, the time to the first INR of more than 4, the time above the therapeutic INR range, the INR response over time, and the warfarin dose requirement.\n\n### RESULTS\n\nAs compared with patients with the non-A/non-A haplotype, patients with the A/A haplotype of *VKORC1* had a decreased time to the first INR within the therapeutic range (P = 0.02) and to the first INR of more than 4 (P = 0.003). In contrast, the *CYP2C9* genotype was not a significant predictor of the time to the first INR within the therapeutic range (P = 0.57) but was a significant predictor of the time to the first INR of more than 4 (P = 0.03). Both the *CYP2C9* genotype and *VKORC1* haplotype had a significant influence on the required warfarin dose after the first 2 weeks of therapy.\n\n### CONCLUSIONS\n\nInitial variability in the INR response to warfarin was more strongly associated with genetic variability in the pharmacologic target of warfarin, VKORC1, than with CYP2C9.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### STUDY DESIGN AND ELIGIBILITY\n\nThe study was conducted at three anticoagulation clinics affiliated with the Vanderbilt University Medical Center: the Pharmacy, Cardiology, and Arthritis and Joint Replacement Center clinics. Patients presenting for initiation of warfarin therapy were prospectively screened to determine eligibility for the study and were enrolled if they provided written informed consent. The center’s institutional review board approved the study.\n\nTo be eligible, patients at least 18 years of age needed to have started warfarin therapy between July 2002 and July 2004. Exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of active cancer requiring, or with the potential to require, concurrent chemotherapy, as well as active alcoholism.\n\nThe target therapeutic INR range was determined by each patient’s physician and varied according to the indication for warfarin treatment. Concurrent medications were categorized into groups of drugs that might potentiate or attenuate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.^1,24^ Amiodarone, because of its marked effects,^25^ was considered separately.\n\n### DATA COLLECTION AND FOLLOW-UP\n\nA trained nurse collected study data by interviewing patients, reviewing their medical records, and obtaining a venous blood sample for DNA extraction. Recorded at baseline were the patient’s age, sex, racial or ethnic background, indication for warfarin therapy, date of initiation of warfarin, target INR range, initial warfarin dose, and concomitant medications. Data regarding subsequent INR values and warfarin doses, the frequency of INR monitoring, and bleeding events were obtained from medical records. Information was recorded in an Oracle database. All patients were followed from the first date of warfarin use until the end of follow-up or the end of treatment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center; the latter was defined as the absence of an INR measurement in the medical record for more than 60 days. The closing date for data collection was July 12, 2004.\n\n### GENOTYPING\n\n*CYP2C9* genotyping was performed with the use of a fluorescent allele-specific oligonucleotide ligation assay after initial polymerase-chain-reaction amplification with the use of primers for the major variant alleles *CYP2C9*2* (430C→T; rs1799853),^26^*CYP2C9*3* (1075A→C; rs1057910), and *CYP2C9*5* (1080C→G; rs28371686), as described previously.^27^ (See [Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix](#SD1), available with the full text of this article at [www.nejm.org](http://www.nejm.org).) The frequencies of *CYP2C9*2* and *CYP2C9*3* variant alleles are 8 to 19% and 3 to 16%, respectively, in white populations, and the frequency of the *CYP2C9*5* variant allele is 0.2 to 1.7% in black populations.^28^\n\n*VKORC1* genotyping for known variants with functional importance within the promoter (−1639G→A or 3673 [rs9923231]) and intronic regions — 497T→G or 5808 (rs2884737), 1173C→T or 6484 (rs9934438), 1542G→C or 6853 (rs8050894), and 2255C→T or 7566 (rs2359612) — was performed with the use of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay (Custom TaqMan) ([Table 2 of the Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)) or TaqMan Validated SNP assays (C_2847860_10 and C_26291751_ 10) with the 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Patients were assigned to the *VKORC1* haplotype group A with the use of five *VKORC1* variants, numbered according to the GenBank accession number [AY587020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY587020) genomic sequence at positions 3673, 5808, 6484, 6853, and 7566, as described previously.^9^ All other patients were assigned to a haplotype group termed non-A, which corresponds closely to the *VKORC1* haplotype group B, as described by Rieder et al.^9^ Haplotypes A and B together account for 96 to 99% of the total haplotypes in white Americans.^9^\n\n### PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES\n\nWe prespecified four primary outcomes for analysis. We calculated the time to the first INR within the therapeutic range and the time to the first INR of more than 4 from the date that warfarin was started. Both of these outcomes were selected specifically to assess the effect of *CYP2C9* genotypes and *VKORC1* haplotypes on the effect of warfarin during initiation of anticoagulation.\n\nWe selected two additional primary outcomes to assess the effect of *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* during a longer interval. The time that the patient’s INR was above the therapeutic range relative to the complete time of follow-up was calculated by interpolation; the difference between an INR value and the subsequent value was divided by the number of days between these two measurements to establish an average daily increment or decrement.^29^ Interpolated INR values were used to calculate the time that patients spent above their individual INR range, relative to the duration of exposure to warfarin. The INR response over time was determined by comparing the average INR value among genotypes during weeks 1 and 2 and during the period between day 29 and the end of follow-up.\n\nPrespecified secondary outcomes included the average daily warfarin dose and bleeding events. The average warfarin daily dose (in milligrams per day) was determined during weeks 1 and 2 and between day 29 and the end of follow-up. In addition, major and minor bleeding events were counted according to the criteria of the Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation study.^30^\n\n### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nWe assessed linkage disequilibrium for the *VKORC1* polymorphisms 3673, 6484, 6853, and 7566 by calculating the square of the correlation coefficient (r^2^) for each pair of variants with the use of genetic-marker data analysis (PowerMarker).^31^ The individual haplotypes of patients were estimated for *VKORC1* and used for subsequent analyses. Tests for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the population were performed with the use of Haploview software.^32^ Frequencies of *CYP2C9* genotypes and *VKORC1* haplotypes among racial groups were compared with the use of chi-square tests of independence. The characteristics of the patients were compared in the *CYP2C9* genotype groups and the *VKORC1* haplotype groups with the use of Student’s t-test, the chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.\n\nThe primary outcomes of the time to the first INR within the therapeutic range and to the first INR of more than 4 were compared among genotype or haplotype groups with the use of log-rank tests. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the hazard ratio for achieving a first INR within the therapeutic range or a first INR of more than 4 in the first 4 weeks and during the entire follow-up period, according to genotype or haplotype group. We prospectively selected potentially confounding variables, including age, race, sex, use of amiodarone, target INR, starting warfarin dose, number of INR tests, and indication for anticoagulation, to adjust comparisons among genotypes and haplotypes. The primary outcome of the time above the therapeutic INR range was compared according to genotype or haplotype with the use of a Kruskal–Wallis ranksum test for the overall comparison and the Tukey–Kramer honest-significant-differences test for pairwise comparisons. The primary outcome of INR response to warfarin during various time periods was explored with the use of the Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test to determine whether there was an effect of genotype or haplotype on the INR. The prespecified secondary outcome of the average dose of warfarin was compared among genotypes and haplotypes with the use of Student’s t-test.\n\nData are presented as means (±SD) or as medians with interquartile ranges, as appropriate. All standard statistical tests were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute). All P-values are two-sided. No statistical corrections for multiple testing were performed.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS\n\nOf the 325 patients who met the entry criteria, 28 were excluded from the analysis for the following reasons (some patients had more than one reason): 7 patients had no INR readings in the first 10 days after the start of warfarin treatment, 12 patients had fewer than two INR readings, 6 patients had no target INR recorded or the target INR was outside the range of 1.8 to 3.5, 3 patients provided no DNA or the DNA was of poor quality, 3 patients had incomplete baseline data collection, 1 patient did not provide a blood sample, 1 patient did not have a recorded start date for warfarin, and 1 patient was undergoing chemotherapy. These exclusions resulted in a final study population of 297 patients.\n\n[Table 1](#T1) summarizes the characteristics of the patients. The target INR ranged from 1.8 to 3.5 and was 2 to 3 in 69% of the patients. The average initial warfarin dose was 4.8±0.8 mg. There was no significant difference among patients with the various *CYP2C9* genotypes and *VKORC1* haplotypes with respect to age, sex, underlying diagnosis, target INR, initial warfarin dose, and proportion of patients receiving concomitant drugs that could potentiate or attenuate the effect of warfarin. The mean numbers of INR measurements during the first 28 days and the entire study period were 7.7±3.8 and 12.4±6.4, respectively, and did not differ significantly among patients with *CYP2C9* genotypes and *VKORC1* haplotypes (P>0.30 for all comparisons). The median follow-up interval was 43 days.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Variable | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Female sex — no. (%) | 137 (46.1) |\n|   |  |\n| Race or ethnic background — no.

The allelic frequency of haplotype A was 32.6%, including 129 heterozygotes and 32 homozygotes ([Table 2](#T2)), and was significantly lower among black patients (13.8%) than among white patients (34.3%) (P = 0.006).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Variant | Frequency in American Population |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | White | Black | All Patients† |\n|   | number (percent) |  |  |\n| VKORC1 haplotype |   |   |   |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| Non-A/non-A | 114 (43.2) | 21 (72.4) | 135 (45.6) |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| Non-A/A | 119 (45.1) | 8 (27.6) | 129 (43.6) |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| A/A | 31 (11.7) | 0 | 32 (10.8) |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| Total | 264 (100.0) | 29 (100.0) | 296 (100.0) |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| CYP2C9 genotype |   |   |   |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| *1/*1 | 176 (66.7) | 27 (96.4) | 204 (69.4) |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| *1/*2 or *1/*3 | 77 (29.2) | 1 (3.6) | 79 (26.9) |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| *2/*2, *3/*3, or *2/*3 | 11 (4.2) | 0 | 11 (3.7) |\n|   |  |  |  |\n| Total | 264 (100.0) | 28 (100.0) | 294 (100.0) |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Frequency of the VKORC1 Haplotype and the CYP2C9 Genotype, According to Race.*\n\nThe allelic frequencies of *CYP2C9*2* and *CYP2C9*3* were 12.0% and 4.8%, respectively. *CYP2C9**5 was not found in any of the patients. For analysis, *CYP2C9* genotypes were considered in three groups: *CYP2C9**1/*1 (wild type), *CYP2C9**1/*2 and *CYP2C9**1/*3 (heterozygotes), and *CYP2C9**2/*2, *CYP2C9**3/*3, and *CYP2C9**2/*3 (homozygotes and compound heterozygotes). The frequency of the *CYP2C9* genotype groups varied significantly among racial or ethnic groups (P = 0.005) ([Table 2](#T2)). There was no deviation from the expected proportions of genotypes in the population predicted by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for polymorphisms in *VKORC1, CYP2C9*2*, and *CYP2C9*3*.\n\n### TIME TO FIRST INR IN THERAPEUTIC RANGE AND FIRST INR ABOVE 4\n\n[Figure 1](#F1) shows the primary outcomes of the times to the first therapeutic INR and to the first INR of more than 4 among various genotypes. The *VKORC1* haplotype had a significant effect on the time that was required to reach the first INR within the therapeutic range (P = 0.02) and the time to the first INR of more than 4 (P = 0.003) ([Fig. 1A and 1B](#F1) and [Table 3](#T3)). Patients with one or two *VKORC1* haplotype A alleles had shorter times to the first INR within the therapeutic range and to an INR of more than 4 than did patients with two haplotype non-A alleles ([Table 4](#T4)). Concordant with these findings, Cox regression analysis with statistical adjustment for potentially confounding covariates showed that among A/A homozygotes, the rate of achieving a first INR within the therapeutic range (both during the initial 28 days and the entire follow-up period) was higher than that of non-A/non-A homozygotes by a factor of nearly 2.4 (P<0.001 for both comparisons); the rate of reaching an INR of more than 4 was higher by more than a factor of 2.5 during the corresponding periods (P = 0.009 for both comparisons) ([Table 4](#T4)). Patients carrying only one A allele were also at higher risk.\n\n### Figure 1.

Carriers of *CYP2C9*2* and *CYP2C9*3* variant alleles did reach a first INR of more than 4 earlier than did patients with the wild-type allele (P = 0.03) ([Fig. 1D](#F1)). This finding was reflected in an increased hazard ratio ([Table 4](#T4)).\n\n### TIME ABOVE THE THERAPEUTIC INR RANGE\n\nThe *VKORC1* haplotype had a significant effect on the primary outcome of the percentage of time above the therapeutic INR range (P = 0.03). Patients who were homozygous for *VKORC1* haplotype A spent significantly more treatment time above their therapeutic INR range than did patients who were homozygous for the non-A haplotype (median percentage, 18.8% vs. 9.1%; P = 0.02). The association between the *CYP2C9* genotype and the time above the therapeutic INR range was weaker and not statistically significant (P = 0.09).\n\n### INR RESPONSE OVER TIME\n\nGenotype differences in INR were more marked early in therapy, probably because the dose of warfarin was titrated according to the INR; therefore, later INR responses reflected this titration ([Table 5](#T5)). The primary outcome of the average INR response was significantly affected by the *VKORC1* haplotype during the first 2 weeks of treatment (P<0.001 for both week 1 and week 2); this relationship was weaker for the *CYP2C9* genotype groups (P = 0.17 for week 1 and P = 0.04 for week 2).\n\n### Table 5.\n\n| Variant | Week 1 |  | Week 2 |  | Day 29 to End of Follow-up |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | AverageWarfarin Dose(mg/day) | AverageINR | AverageWarfarin Dose(mg/day) | AverageINR | AverageWarfarin Dose(mg/day) | AverageINR |\n| VKORC1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Non-A/non-A | 5.07±0.91 | 1.41±0.47 | 5.59±1.88 | 2.17±0.89 | 5.68±2.46 | 2.26±0.46 |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Non-A/A | 4.76±1.03 | 1.59±0.61 | 4.80±1.88 | 2.54±1.55 | 4.45±2.06 | 2.41±0.50 |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| A/A | 4.66±0.83 | 1.95±0.80 | 3.76±1.45 | 3.07±1.34 | 3.66±2.07 | 2.20±0.29 |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| P value† | <0.001 | <0.001 | <0.001 | <0.001 | <0.001 | 0.03 |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| CYP2C9 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *1/*1 | 4.95±0.98 | 1.52±0.58 | 5.19±1.99 | 2.31±1.10 | 5.18±2.20 | 2.28±0.50 |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *1/*2 or *1/*3 | 4.81±0.89 | 1.62±0.68 | 4.69±1.71 | 2.74±1.71 | 4.25±2.36 | 2.45±0.34 |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *2/*2, *3/*3, or *2/3 | 4.53±0.85 | 1.63±0.29 | 4.34±1.26 | 2.77±0.97 | 3.36±1.58 | 2.48±0.40 |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| P value† | 0.09 | 0.17 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.005 | 0.13 |\n\nTable 5 Caption: Average Warfarin Daily Dose and Average INR among Patients with a VKORC1 Haplotype or CYP2C9 Genotype during Weeks 1 and 2 and from Day 29 to the End of Follow-up.*\n\n### SINGLE-GENE EFFECTS ON WARFARIN DOSE REQUIREMENT\n\nThe *VKORC1* haplotype affected the prespecified secondary outcome of average warfarin dose in weeks 1 and 2 and from day 29 to the end of follow up (P<0.001 for all comparisons) ([Table 5](#T5)). There was a gene–dose effect, with haplotype A associated with a higher INR response requiring lower doses of warfarin. The *CYP2C9* genotype was also associated with the warfarin dose, but the effect was less marked during the first 2 weeks of therapy than after the first 28 days ([Table 5](#T5)).\n\n### BLEEDING RISK\n\nThe risk of bleeding was assessed as a prespecified secondary outcome. There were eight major and five minor bleeding events involving 12 patients (1 patient had two events), as defined by the Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation study^30^ ([Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)). The majority of bleeding events (9 of 13) occurred within the first 28 days after the initiation of warfarin treatment at a mean dose of 4.4±1.4 mg per day and a median INR of 3.7 (range, 1.7 to 12.3). Patients with bleeding events were older (median age, 71 years) than the study population (median age, 61 years). Two patients with bleeding events were homozygous for *CYP2C9**2, three were heterozygous (one patient had *CYP2C9**1/*2, and two patients had *CYP2C9**1/*3), and seven had *CYP2C9**1/*1. Three patients were homozygous for *VKORC1* haplotype non-A, seven were heterozygous for non-A/A, and two were homozygous for A.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThis study of patients who were starting warfarin therapy investigated the relationship between *VKORC1* haplotypes and *CYP2C9* genotypes and the INR responses that are used to adjust doses. The major finding was that genetic variation in *VKORC1*, but not in *CYP2C9*, modulates the early response to warfarin.\n\nWe found that patients carrying *VKORC1* haplotype A had significantly higher INR values in the first week than did non-A homozygotes. These differences in response occurred despite empiric dose adjustment of warfarin. In contrast, the *CYP2C9* genotype did not significantly affect INR responses during the first week. We also found that the *VKORC1* haplotype predicted both the time to the first INR within the therapeutic range and the time to the first INR of more than 4. Among patients who were carrying two A alleles, the rate of reaching these outcomes at given time intervals was approximately twice that of non-A homozygotes; patients with one A allele also showed an increased risk of reaching an INR above 4.\n\nMost recent studies of the role of genetic variants in the response to warfarin enrolled patients receiving stable anticoagulation^13,15–18,33^ or those who had undergone 1 to 3 months of warfarin pretreatment.^10,11,14^ Studies that enrolled patients who were just starting therapy have primarily focused on differences in the warfarin dose.^9,12^ Two studies analyzing the first few weeks of warfarin treatment showed that among carriers of the *CYP2C9**2 or *CYP2C9**3 allele, the proportion of patients with INR values of more than 3 was higher than that of patients who were not carriers.^34,35^ However, in a study in which the prospective dose of warfarin was based on *CYP2C9* genotype, carriers of a variant allele had an increased risk of having an INR of more than 4.^36^\n\nOur findings contrast with those of a recent study by Millican et al.^37^ that examined the use of clinical and genetic variables for predicting the maintenance dose of warfarin in 92 patients. In that study, genotyping for *VKORC1* contributed little to the final statistical model; the INR after the third dose of warfarin was the strongest predictor of the maintenance dose. As we have shown, the early INR response is strongly affected by the *VKORC1* haplotype. Thus, as shown by Millican et al., the contribution of *VKORC1* was captured in the INR after three doses of warfarin.\n\nAn increase in the anticoagulant response over time (as indicated by an INR above the therapeutic range) is associated with an increased risk of bleeding.^3^ Therefore, in addition to the time to the first INR of more than 4, the amount of time spent above the therapeutic INR range is informative. In our study, the *VKORC1* haplotype affected the time that patients spent above the therapeutic INR range, whereas the *CYP2C9* genotype had a marginal effect. However, both the *VKORC1* haplotype and the *CYP2C9* genotype had a significant effect on the warfarin dose after the first 2 weeks. Our results confirm the relationship between the *CYP2C9* genotype and the response to warfarin that has been observed by others,^6,36,38^ but they also indicate that early in the course of anticoagulation the effect of the *VKORC1* haplotype is greater than that of the *CYP2C9* genotype, and the presence of a *VKORC1* A allele is associated with an accelerated and greater sensitivity to warfarin.\n\nSerious bleeding events were not significantly affected by the presence of the *VKORC1* haplotype or *CYP2C9* genotype. However, our study focused on changes in the INR and the warfarin dose during the first few weeks of therapy and not with therapy of longer duration, so the number of events was small.\n\nIn conclusion, during the initial phase of anticoagulation, genetic variants of *VKORC1* are a major determinant of variability in sensitivity to warfarin among patients. Genetic variants of *CYP2C9*, in contrast, appear to have limited influence during the initiation of warfarin therapy.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nSupported by the following grants from the National Institutes of Health: a Pharmacogenetics Research Network Grant (U01-HL65962), HL04012, and GM31304.

The relationship between polymorphisms in genes encoding MTX transporters and MTX response is controversial. In the present study, 322 Chinese children with standard- and intermediate-risk ALL were genotyped for 12 polymorphisms. SLCO1B1 rs10841753 showed a significant association with plasma MTX levels at 48 h (P = 0.017). Patients who had the ABCB1 rs1128503 C allele had longer duration of hospitalization than did those with the TT genotype (P = 0.006). No association was found between oral mucositis and any polymorphism. Long-term outcome was worse in patients with the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 CC genotype than in patients with TT or TC (5-year event-free survival [EFS] 33.3 ± 19.2% vs. 90.5 ± 1.7%, P < 0.001), and was worse in patients with the SCL19A1 rs2838958 AA genotype than in patients with AG or GG (5-year EFS 78.5 ± 4.6% vs. 92.2 ± 1.8%, P = 0.008). Multiple Cox regression analyses revealed associations of minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 33 (hazard ratio 3.458; P = 0.002), MRD at day 78 (hazard ratio 6.330; P = 0.001), SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (hazard ratio 12.242; P < 0.001), and SCL19A1 rs2838958 (hazard ratio 2.324; P = 0.019) with EFS. Our findings show that polymorphisms in genes encoding MTX transporters substantially influence the kinetics and response to HDMTX therapy in childhood ALL.\n\nKeywords: methotrexate, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, polymorphism, SLCO1B1, SLC19A1\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nMethotrexate (MTX) has been widely used as an anticancer agent in most chemotherapy protocols for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Despite its clinical success, MTX may cause serve adverse effects and toxicities [[1](#R1)–[3](#R3)]. MTX pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity have great inter-patient variability. This diversity can be partly explained by sequence differences in genes encoding MTX membrane transporter proteins [[4](#R4)–[6](#R6)].\n\nMTX enters the cell via the solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1) or the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) [[7](#R7), [8](#R8)]. It is exported from the cells by ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), and ABC subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) [[4](#R4)]. Previous studies suggest that variations in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding MTX transporters play a great role in ALL prognosis and MTX response [[9](#R9)–[15](#R15)], but the results are inconsistent, which might result from small study cohorts, heterogeneous study populations, and differences in treatment protocols.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of the present study was to investigate the influence of SNPs on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of high-dose MTX (HDMTX), as well as clinical outcome in ALL patients. A total of 12 SNPs in four genes involved in the MTX transport pathway (*SLCO1B1, SLC19A1, ABCB1*, and *ABCG2*) were selected. The association study was carried out in 322 Chinese children with ALL treated according to the Beijing Children's Hospital (BCH)-2003 and Chinese Childhood Leukemia Group (CCLG)-2008 protocols.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Patient and genotyping characteristics\n\nPatient characteristics are shown in [Supplementary Table 1](#SD1). No significant differences were observed between patients included (*n* = 322) and those not included (*n* = 142) in this study.\n\nWe genotyped 12 SNPs in four genes (*SLCO1B1, SLC19A1, ABCB1*, and *ABCG2*). The selected SNPs and allele frequencies are shown in [Supplementary Table 2](#SD1) with an average call rate of 98.23%. *ABCB1* rs2032582 was excluded from the following analyses because its allele frequencies deviated from HWE.\n\n### SNPs with pharmacokinetics\n\nTo explore the impact of SNPs on MTX pharmacokinetics, we tested the association between selected SNPs and MTX plasma level at 48 h from the first dose of HDMTX infusion. Plasma MTX data were available for 317 patients with the range from 0.09 μmol/L to 41.63 μmol/L (median: 0.45 μmol/L). We found a statistically significant association between plasma MTX level and the *SLCO1B1* rs10841753. Patients with CC genotypes had a lower MTX plasma level than did patients with the T allele (CT+TT) (*P* = 0.017) (Table [1](#T1) and [Supplementary Figure 2A](#SD1)). The MTX plasma concentration at 48 h was higher in patients with the *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 CC genotype compared with those with the T allele (TC+TT) (1.1μmol/L vs. 0.45 μmol/L, *P* = 0.441), and was lower in patients with the *SLCO1B1* rs11045879 TT genotype compared with those with the C allele (CC+TC) (0.39 μmol/L vs.0.50 μmol/L, *P* = 0.287). The trends were consistent with previous studies, but the association did not reach statistical significance (Table [2](#T2) and [Supplementary Figure 2B](#SD1) and [2C](#SD1)). Both of the patients who died after receiving the first course of HDMTX had a high plasma MTX level at 48 h (13.09 μmol/L and 8.93 μmol/L, respectively). Their genotypes for *SLCO1B1* rs10841753, rs4149056, rs11045879, and rs2306283 were TC, TT, TC, TC, and TT, TC, TC, CC, respectively. We also analyzed the association between polymorphisms and MTX plasma levels during administration of the four courses by repeated measures ANOVA; however, none of the associations was significant.\n\n### Table 1.

To investigate genetic determinants for oral mucositis after HDMTX, information regarding oral mucositis during the consolidation therapy period was available for 317 patients. Table [3](#T3) shows the risk evaluation for the development of grade 3–4 oral mucositis, calculated by univariate analysis. A total of 38 patients developed grade 3–4 oral mucositis (12.0%). No polymorphism was found to be associated with oral mucositis, although it occurred more frequently in patients with the *ABCB1* rs1128503C allele (CC and TC) than in those with the TT genotype (OR 2.009, 95% CI 0.987–4.090, *P* = 0.054). With regard to *SLCO1B1* rs4149056, patients with the C allele had a lower risk of developing mucositis. None of the six patients with the CC genotypes developed oral mucositis. The frequency was 8.47% for patients with TC, and 13.25% for those with TT; however, the differences among genotypes were not statistically significant (Table [3](#T3) and [Supplementary Figure 3](#SD1)).\n\n### Table 3.

[Supplementary Figure 4](#SD1) shows that *SLCO1B1* rs10841753, rs2306283, rs4149056, and *SLC19A1* rs3788200, rs1051266, rs1131596 were in LD, respectively. None of the haplotypes was associated with MTX level or MTX-induced oral mucositis ([Supplementary Tables 3](#SD1) and [4](#SD1)).\n\n### SNPs with treatment outcome\n\nTo define the influence of selected SNPs on treatment outcomes of ALL patients, we did both univariate and multivariate analyses. Univariate analyses showed that *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 and *SLC19A1* rs2838958 were significantly associated with the risk of events (*P* < 0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Compared with patients with the rs4149056 T allele (TC+TT), patients with the CC genotype had a poorer outcome (5-year EFS 33.3 ± 19.2% vs. 90.5 ± 1.7; Figure [1A](#F1)). Among the six patients with the rs4149056 CC genotype, three patients relapsed and one died of infection. The *SLC19A1* rs2838958 AA genotype was associated with poorer outcome than was the G allele (AG+GG) (5-year EFS 78.5 ± 4.6% vs 92.2 ± 1.8%; Figure [1B](#F1)). In our study, the *SLC19A1* rs1051266 A allele (AA+AG) was associated with better outcome than was the GG genotype (5-year EFS 91.9 ± 1.9% vs. 82.1 ± 4.1%; [Supplementary Figure 5](#SD1)), but this association was not statistically significant (*P* = 0.08).\n\n### Figure 1. Polymorphisms and event-free survival (EFS).\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c56a/5514947/7bd4a35da2ee/oncotarget-08-37761-g001.jpg)\n\n(A) The Kaplan-Meier survival curve is shown to illustrate the difference between SLCO1B1 rs4149056 CC variant and TT/TC variants (log-rank P < 0.001). (B) The Kaplan-Meier survival curve is shown to illustrate the difference between SLC19A1 rs2838958 AA variant and GG/AG variants (log-rank P = 0.008).\n\nIn a multivariate Cox regression analysis that included immunophenotype, WBC, *TEL/AML1*, MRD class (day 33 and day 78), and *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 and *SLC19A1* rs2838958 genotypes as independent variables, *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 and *SLC19A1* rs2838958 genotypes and MRD class were shown to be independent prognostic factors (Table [5](#T5)). The adjusted hazard ratios were 12.242 (95% CI = 3.937–38.059; *P* < 0.001) for patients with the *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 CC genotype vs those with the T allele (TC+TT). The *SLC19A1* rs2838958 AA genotype still had a poorer prognosis than did the G allele (AG+GG) (hazard ratio, 2.324, 95% CI 1.147–4.710; *P* = 0.019). In addition, the presence of MRD at day 33 and day 78 also had significant effect on outcome (hazard ratio, 3.458, 95% CI 1.598–7.483; *P* = 0.002; hazard ratio, 6.330, 95% CI 2.181–18.369; *P* = 0.001). Other clinical features, such as WBC, *TEL-AML1*, and immunophenotype were not independent prognostic factors.\n\n### Table 5.

There is great inter-individual variability in MTX response [[4](#R4), [5](#R5), [16](#R16), [17](#R17)]. Several SNPs in genes involved in the MTX transporter pathway have been implicated in the kinetics and effects of MTX in previous studies [[9](#R9)–[15](#R15)], but some results are ambiguous. In the present study, we evaluated the correlation of 12 polymorphisms in four genes involved in the MTX transport pathway with pharmacokinetics and toxicity of HDMTX as well as outcomes in 322 Chinese ALL patients.\n\n*SLCO1B1* rs10841753 showed a significant association with the MTX plasma level at 48 h from the first dose of HDMTX infusion in our study. Lower plasma MTX concentrations were found in patients with the rs10841753 CC genotype than in patients with TC or TT genotype. The *SLCO1B1* gene encodes an organic anion transporter (OATP1B1) that is located on the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes, and mediates disposition of many medications [[18](#R18)–[20](#R20)]. Previous studies reported that SLCO1B1 can transport MTX *in vitro* [[21](#R21), [22](#R22)], and *in vivo* [[23](#R23)]. Although many SNPs have been identified in the *SLCO1B1* gene, only a few are known to have functional significance [[24](#R24)]. The common *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 variant results in decreased transport *in vitro* [[8](#R8)], whereas the *SLCO1B1* rs2306283 variant increases the transport activity for MTX *in vitro* [[22](#R22)]. The genome-wide study by Trevino et al. demonstrated that *SLCO1B1* rs11045879, rs4149056, and eight additional SNPs including rs10841753 are strongly associated with MTX clearance in childhood ALL [[25](#R25)]. The functional rs2306283 in *SLCO1B1* was recognized by Ramsey et al. as a predictor of MTX clearance in ALL patients [[22](#R22)]. The association between *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 and MTX clearance was confirmed in subsequent studies [[5](#R5), [14](#R14), [15](#R15), [26](#R26)]. Li et al. replicated the association between *SLCO1B1* rs11045879 and MTX plasma levels in 280 Chinese pediatric B–ALL patients [[27](#R27)]; however, other studies show conflicting results. Lopez-Lopez et al. failed to show a statistically significant association between rs11045879 and MTX plasma concentrations in patients with ALL (corrected *P* = 0.08) [[12](#R12)]. In our study, we could not validate the influence of *SLCO1B1* rs4149056, rs11045879, and rs2306283 on MTX pharmacokinetics. Our results showed that lower MTX plasma concentration at 48 h was found in patients with the rs4149056 T allele (TC+TT) than in patients with the CC genotype (0.45 μmol/L vs. 1.1 μmol/L), in patients with the rs11045879 TT genotype compared with the CC or TC genotype (0.39μmol/L vs.0.50μmol/L), and in patients with the rs2306283 TT genotype compared with the CC or TC genotype (0.37 μmol/L vs. 0.45 μmol/L), which was consistent with previous results. However, the association did not reach statistical significance (*P* = 0.441, 0.287, 0.294, respectively). Trevino et al. reported that *SLCO1B1* genetic variation accounted for only 9.3% of the MTX inter-patient variability, compared with 17.9% for the treatment regimen [[25](#R25)]. Thus, the differences between our protocol and other protocols, including MTX dosage, the methodology of leucovorin rescue, and concomitant hydration and alkalinization may be the possible reasons for the inconsistent results. *SLCO1B1* rs10841753 is an SNP that is located in the intron of the gene. It is unknown how this variant affects the function of *SLCO1B1*, perhaps by effects on transcription and post-transcriptional processing [[25](#R25)]. We replicated the association between MTX plasma level with rs10841753, confirming that *SLCO1B1* was a predictor for MTX pharmacokinetics in our cohort, and that different polymorphisms can affect the functions of *SLCO1B1* and MTX clearance.\n\nBecause altered MTX pharmacokinetics may affect adverse drug reactions and treatment efficacy, MTX toxicity and survival were also investigated in this study. Oral mucositis is a common side effect attributed to the use of HDMTX. One previous study found that *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 was associated with the risk of mucositis [[15](#R15)]; however, this association was not replicated in two other studies [[14](#R14), [25](#R25)]. In our study, patients with the *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 C allele had a lower risk of developing mucositis. None of the six patients with the CC genotype developed oral mucositis, but the differences among genotypes were not statistically significant. Several factors, including differences in early symptomatic treatment for toxicity, toxicity criteria, treatment protocols, and sample sizes of groups may be responsible for the inconsistent results. Compared with patients with the TT genotype, those with the *ABCB1* rs1128503C allele had a higher risk of developing oral mucositis after receiving HDMTX (*P* = 0.054)), and had a longer duration of hospitalization for the HDMTX treatment (*P* = 0.006). Zgheib et al. found that rs1128503 was associated with neutropenia [[28](#R28)]. It is possible that the *ABCB1* rs1128503C allele is associated with several different manifestations of drug toxicity, which may lead to prolongation of the treatment period. A larger study should be performed to confirm the association.\n\nWe next analyzed the prognostic roles of selected polymorphisms in childhood ALL. Our results showed that *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 and *SLC19A1* rs2838958 were independent prognostic factors in our study. Zhang et al. found that rs4149056 was not associated with the risk of relapse in 136 Chinese pediatric ALL patients. But interestingly, their results showed that patients with the C allele (CC+TC) were given higher leucovorin doses than were patients with the TT genotype [[15](#R15)]. In addition, Skaby et al. reported that higher leucovorin doses during HDMTX treatment may raise the risk for relapse [[29](#R29)]. Based on these data, it seemed that the rs4149056 C allele should be associated with higher risk for relapse. We found that patients with the rs4149056 CC genotype had poorer outcome than did those with the TC or TT genotype (5-year EFS 33.3 ± 19.2%% vs. 90.5 ± 1.7; Figure [1A](#F1)), which were theoretically reasonable. The sample size in the study by Zhang et al. was relatively small; there were only two patients with the rs4149056 CC alleles, which might obscure the prognostic role of rs4149056. Furthermore, the median follow-up time in the present study was longer than the follow-up time in the study by Zhang et al (75 months vs. 60 months), which is important because relapses tend to occur late in many low-risk ALL patients [[15](#R15)]. Thus, the correlation between rs4149056 and EFS should be further validated.\n\nIt is noteworthy that we also found that *SLC19A1* rs2838958 was an independent prognostic factor in our study. *SLC19A1* encodes the reduced folate carrier (RFC) which delivers folate into cells [[10](#R10)]. *SLC19A1* rs2838958 is a tag SNP of *SLC19A1* in the CHB population and is located in the intron of the gene. Univariate analysis showed that *SLC19A1* rs2838958 was significantly associated with the risk of adverse events (*P* = 0.008). The *SLC19A1* rs2838958 AA genotype was associated with poorer outcome than was the G allele (AG+GG) (5-year EFS 78.5 ± 4.6% vs 92.2 ± 1.8%; Figure [1B](#F1)). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, the *SLC19A1* rs2838958 AA genotype still was associated with a poorer prognosis than was the G allele (AG+GG) (hazard ratio, 2.324, 95% CI 1.147–4.710; *P* = 0.019). As far as we know, this is the first study to correlate this polymorphism with outcome in pediatric ALL; however, the exact mechanism of rs2838958 is unknown. The rs1051266 (80G>A, His27Arg) was the most studied SNP in the gene *SLC19A1*. In previous studies, there were conflicting results on the prognostic significance of *SLC19A1* rs1051266 [[9](#R9), [10](#R10), [14](#R14), [30](#R30)]. Several studies have previously investigated the effect of rs1051266 on outcome in childhood ALL, but the results were inconsistent. Rocha et al. and Radtke et al. could not demonstrate any significant effect on cure rates in 246 and 499 children with ALL, respectively [[14](#R14), [30](#R30)], although Laverdiere et al., in a study of 204 patients, found a reduced rate of relapse for patients with the G-allele, and Gregers et al., in a study of 500 patients, found a decreased EFS rate in patients who had the G-allele [[9](#R9), [10](#R10)]. Our data showed that patients with the *SLC19A1* rs1051266 GG genotype had a poorer outcome than did patients with AA or AG genotypes (5-year EFS 82.1 ± 4.1%; vs. 91.9 ± 1.9%, [Supplementary Figure 5](#SD1)), but this association was not statistically significant (*P* = 0.08).\n\nThis study has some limitations. It is a retrospective study with a modest sample size and limited SNPs in the MTX transport pathway. In addition, oral mucositis was the only manifestation of MTX toxicity that we studied; we did not include other common adverse drug reactions. Further study and replication in an independent cohort are needed to confirm our recent results.\n\nIn conclusion, our results show that polymorphisms in the MTX transport pathway are associated with MTX plasma levels and outcome in childhood ALL, which may help to guide and optimize MTX treatment in patients with childhood ALL.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Patients and treatment\n\nBetween October 1, 2006 and August 1, 2010, 553 Chinese children were newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Beijing Children's Hospital. Of these, patients with standard-risk ALL (SR) and intermediate-risk (IR) were included in this study if a sufficient sample of good quality DNA was available. A total of 322 patients (aged 1.0–15.0 years; median: 4.0 years) were eligible according to these criteria ([Supplementary Figure 1](#SD1)). The BCH-2003 protocol was followed in 104 patients between October 2006 and March 2008, and the CCLG-2008 protocol was followed in 218 patients after April 2008. Of these, 117 patients were classified as having SR ALL, and 205 as having IR ALL. Details of the stratification and treatment regimens of the two protocols have been published previously [[16](#R16)] and are outlined in Table [1](#T1). At a median follow-up time of 75 months (range, 1.0–115.0), 278 patients were in first remission, 33 patients had relapsed, five had died of severe infection (one patient before the first HDMTX), two had died of severe HDMTX toxicity, and four patients had been lost follow-up before the first HDMTX. The BCH-2003 and CCLG-2008 protocols were approved by the Beijing Children's Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all guardians.\n\n### Minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis\n\nMRD was measured using RQ-PCR-based quantification of IgH gene rearrangements, as previously reported [[31](#R31)–[33](#R33)]. In this study, 297 samples were examined for MRD at day 33, and 278 samples were examined at day 78. Patients with an MRD <10^–4^ at day 33 were considered to have a good response to early treatment. An MRD> 10^–2^ at day 33 or an MRD >10^–3^ at day 78 represented a poor response.\n\n### Candidate gene and polymorphism selection\n\nThe selection of candidate genes and SNPs was based on the results of genome-wide association studies, candidate gene association studies, and tag SNPs for CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing) population selected from the HapMap database ([http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)). A total of 12 SNPs in four genes encoding MTX membrane transporter proteins were selected. Detailed information regarding the selected genes and SNPs is shown in [Supplementary Table 1](#SD1). The SNP inclusion criteria were minor allele frequency (MAF)>10%, and in that the gene was demonstrably in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the population.\n\n### DNA extraction and genotyping\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted using a Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (U-gene, Anhui, China) from bone marrow specimens at diagnosis according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genotyping was performed on the Sequenom MassARRAY (San Diego, CA, USA) platform in OEbiotech Corporation in Shanghai, China. SNPs with genotyping call rate less than 95% were excluded.\n\n### HDMTX\n\nPatients received four courses of MTX every 2 weeks during the consolidation phase of chemotherapy (day 8, 22, 36, 50). MTX was administered as follows: 10% of the total dose was administered by intravenous infusion over 0.5 hours, and the remaining 90% over 23.5 hours (MTX doses for each treatment arms are shown in Table [1](#T1)). Leucovorin rescue was initiated with a 15 mg/m^2^ dose at 42 h after the start of the HDMTX infusion, and given twice more, at 48 and 54 h after the infusion. A high plasma MTX level after 48 h (> 0.25 μmol/L) was defined as an indication for prolonged rescue. Monitoring of MTX concentration in plasma was carried out every day until the level was below 0.2 umol/L.\n\nBlood samples of 2 ml were collected at 48 h after the continuous MTX infusion over 24 h. The MTX plasma levels were evaluated by fluorescence polarization immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (TDx Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). Before receiving HDMTX therapy, one patient died from infection and four patients were lost to follow-up. Thus, plasma MTX data at 48 h was available for 317 patients. After receiving the first course of HDMTX, one patient died from Stevens-Johnson syndrome and one from severe gastrointestinal mucositis and infection.\n\n### Toxicity\n\nOral mucositis is a common manifestation of toxicity that has been attributed specifically to HDMTX [[14](#R14)]. In this study, oral mucositis was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 scoring system ([http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf](http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf)). The most severe mucositis (Grade 3–4) observed in each patient during the consolidation therapy period was recorded objectively from electronic patient files (blinded to genotypes and MTX levels).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe allele frequencies of all polymorphisms were tested for HWE using χ^2^. An SNP was excluded from the statistical analysis if the frequencies of the wild type and variant alleles deviated from the HWE requirement. The association between MTX concentrations (first course of HDMTX) and polymorphisms was evaluated by the Mann-Whitney *U* test. The association between MTX concentrations of the four courses of HDMTX and polymorphisms was evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA. The differences in duration of hospitalization between genotypes were compared using Student's *t* test. Toxicity was represented by the value 1 or 0, indicating whether an adverse event did or did not occur during the MTX course. Statistical associations between the susceptibility to toxicity and the polymorphisms were analyzed using logistic regression. Haploview v.4.2 was used to determine the haplotype block and to infer haplotype frequencies between individuals with and without toxicity. The duration of event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from diagnosis to the date of relapse or death for any reasons (whichever came first), or the last contact with patients in continuous hematologic remission. EFS probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between groups were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression models adjust for potential confounding variables were used to analyze the prognostic significance of candidate polymorphisms. Two-sided *P*-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.\n\n## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLES\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by in part by Beijing Nova Project (No.Z151100000315093), National Natural Science Foundation Project (No.81300434, 81300432, 81170504), Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (No.7152054), Beijing Health Qualified Personnel Program (No. 2011-3-049), National Science & Technology Major Project of the 12th 5-Year Plan (No. 2011ZX09302007-01), Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals Clinical Medicine Development of Special Grant (No.ZY201404), Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals Deng Feng Program (No.DFL20151101), and the Capital Health and Development of Special Grant (No.2016-1-2091).

Studies have provided conflicting data, and meta-analyses suggest a small but significant increase in cancer recurrence, necessitating additional studies to allow for accurate effect assessment. We conducted a retrospective pharmacogenomic analysis of a prospectively collected community-based cohort of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer to test for associations between low-activity CYP2D6 genotype and disease outcome in 500 patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy and 500 who did not receive any systemic adjuvant therapy.\n\n**Methods:** \nTumor-derived DNA was genotyped for common, functionally consequential CYP2D6 polymorphisms (*2, *3, *4, *6, *10, *41 and copy number variants) and assigned a CYP2D6 activity score (AS) ranging from none (0) to full (2). Patients with poor metabolizer (PM, AS=0) phenotype were compared to patients with AS>0 and in secondary analyses AS was analyzed quantitatively. Clinical outcome of interest was recurrence free survival (RFS) and analyses using long-rank test were adjusted for relevant clinical covariates (nodal status, tumor size, etc.).\n\n**Results:** \nCYP2D6 AS was not associated with RFS in tamoxifen treated patients in univariate analyses (p>0.2). In adjusted analyses, increasing AS was associated with inferior RFS (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.00–2.04, p=0.05). In patients that did not receive tamoxifen treatment, increasing CYP2D6 AS, and AS>0, were associated with superior RFS (each p=0.0015).\n\n**Conclusions:** \nThis population-based study does not support the hypothesis that patients with diminished CYP2D6 activity achieve inferior tamoxifen benefit. These contradictory findings suggest that the association between CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen treatment efficacy is null or near null, and unlikely to be useful in clinical practice.\n\nKeywords: Pharmacogenetic, CYP2D6, tamoxifen, prognostic, predictive\n\n### Purpose:\n\nA number of studies have tested the hypothesis that breast cancer patients with low-activity CYP2D6 genotypes achieve inferior benefit from tamoxifen treatment, putatively due to lack of metabolic activation to endoxifen. Studies have provided conflicting data, and meta-analyses suggest a small but significant increase in cancer recurrence, necessitating additional studies to allow for accurate effect assessment. We conducted a retrospective pharmacogenomic analysis of a prospectively collected community-based cohort of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer to test for associations between low-activity CYP2D6 genotype and disease outcome in 500 patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy and 500 who did not receive any systemic adjuvant therapy.\n\n### Methods:\n\nTumor-derived DNA was genotyped for common, functionally consequential CYP2D6 polymorphisms (*2, *3, *4, *6, *10, *41 and copy number variants) and assigned a CYP2D6 activity score (AS) ranging from none (0) to full (2). Patients with poor metabolizer (PM, AS=0) phenotype were compared to patients with AS>0 and in secondary analyses AS was analyzed quantitatively. Clinical outcome of interest was recurrence free survival (RFS) and analyses using long-rank test were adjusted for relevant clinical covariates (nodal status, tumor size, etc.).\n\n### Results:\n\nCYP2D6 AS was not associated with RFS in tamoxifen treated patients in univariate analyses (p>0.2). In adjusted analyses, increasing AS was associated with inferior RFS (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.00–2.04, p=0.05). In patients that did not receive tamoxifen treatment, increasing CYP2D6 AS, and AS>0, were associated with superior RFS (each p=0.0015).\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nThis population-based study does not support the hypothesis that patients with diminished CYP2D6 activity achieve inferior tamoxifen benefit. These contradictory findings suggest that the association between CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen treatment efficacy is null or near null, and unlikely to be useful in clinical practice.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen, and third generation aromatase inhibitors (AI) including anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane have played a substantial role in decreasing breast cancer mortality, especially when used in the adjuvant setting[[1](#R1)]. Approximately 60–70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, but only 60% of these will respond to therapy[[2](#R2)]. It is not currently possible to identify which patients with ER-positive cancers will respond to anti-estrogens nor is it possible to determine whether a particular treatment (tamoxifen or an AI) will be more effective for an individual patient.\n\nTamoxifen is an estrogen receptor antagonist in breast cancer cells, accounting for its favorable anti-neoplastic effect. There are data suggesting that the effectiveness of tamoxifen can be partially attributed to its metabolic activation to more potent anti-estrogenic metabolites including 4-OH-tamoxifen (4-OH-tam) and 4-OH-N- desmethyl-tamoxifen, also called endoxifen[[3](#R3)]. This bioactivation is mediated primarily by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family member 2D6 (CYP2D6), which shows large phenotypical variations due to genetic polymorphisms[[4](#R4)]. Though hundreds of polymorphisms have been identified, the majority of variation in metabolic activity can be accounted for by a relatively small number of no function (*3, *4, *6) or diminished function (*10, *41) alleles[[5](#R5)].\n\nLow-activity polymorphisms in CYP2D6 are associated with decreased plasma concentrations of endoxifen[[6](#R6),[7](#R7),[3](#R3),[8](#R8)]. We and others have hypothesized that tamoxifen efficacy would be diminished in patients who have lower endoxifen concentration[[9](#R9),[10](#R10)] or carry low-activity CYP2D6 polymorphisms[[11](#R11)–[14](#R14)], however, these associations have not been established[[15](#R15),[16](#R16)]. These inconsistent results can be attributed to a number of factors including differences in patient, tumor, or treatment characteristics or incomplete genotyping analysis[[17](#R17),[18](#R18)]. Alternatively, another explanation for the varying results is that the underlying hypothesis is null or near null[[19](#R19),[20](#R20)]. Given the potential clinical significance of a predictive biomarker for tamoxifen efficacy, it is necessary to conduct additional studies in large cohorts of tamoxifen treated patients.\n\nHere we report the results from a retrospective pharmacogenetic analysis of a large prospectively collected patient cohort. Specifically, our objective was to test for an association between CYP2D6 phenotype and benefit of tamoxifen[[21](#R21)], utilizing DNA from tumors collected from patients treated with surgery and adjuvant tamoxifen or with surgery only (n=500 for each group). Our prespecified hypothesis was that patients who had low CYP2D6 metabolic activity, based on CYP2D6 genotype, would have worse treatment outcomes in the tamoxifen treated cohort but similar outcomes in the surgery only group.\n\n## Methods:\n\n### Patient Cohort\n\nThis secondary analysis was performed using patients from two breast cancer databases and corresponding biobanks maintained by the Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM, Houston, TX) that have been previously described in detail[[22](#R22)]. Briefly, the PPG/P01 database and biobank, funded by the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD), collected tissue and data on disease, adjuvant treatment and outcomes from community physicians for patients with early breast cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were similar to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Registry for the same period. The second database and biobank, maintained as part of a Breast Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) grant funded by the National Cancer Institute, collected similar tissue and clinical data, with follow-up information coming from tumor registries for patients with early breast cancer who were diagnosed and treated between 1984 and 1999 from community hospitals throughout the United States. Comparison to SEER data for early breast cancer from more or less the same time period suggests that death has been very reliably ascertained, while disease recurrence was slightly underascertained. This is expected, given that data derived from hospital tumor registries not MD offices. The effective sample size slightly reduced; however, there is no reason to think there is a difference in completeness by genotype.\n\nSelection of patients from these databases for the BCM Breast Tumor DNA Bank-v1 has been described previously[[22](#R22)]. Briefly, Caucasian patients from either database with ER+ tumors (>3 fmol/mg protein) that received surgery and tamoxifen (“treated”, n=500) or no systemic treatment (“untreated”, n=500), had complete patient and tumor information, and sufficient banked tumor material, were selected. Treatment within these observational registries was in accordance with standard clinical practice. Duration of tamoxifen therapy reflects community practice during the time period and patient/physician preference. No patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of n=213, and n=787 samples came from the P01 and SPORE banks, respectively.\n\n### Genotyping and CYP2D6 Phenotype Assignment\n\nFresh, whole-tumor specimens were flash frozen and maintained in the biobank. These specimens thawed for approximately three days during a tropical storm that flooded the biobank, prior to being refrozen. DNA was isolated using Puregene® DNA Purification Kit (Qiagen) in the BCM Genetics Core. The DNA samples were genotyped for CYP2D6 gene variants using the Taqman® Allelic Discrimination assays (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) as described previously[[7](#R7)]. The CYP2D6 gene variants determined include: *2 (rs1135840), *3 (rs35742686), *4 (rs3892097), *6 (rs5030655), *10 (rs1065852), *41 (rs28371725), Assays were run in a Step-One Plus instrument (Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster City, CA). Detailed information on CYP2D6 allele nomenclature can be found at [http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm](http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm). Call rate for each allele genotyped was >99%; random selection and re-genotyping of approximately 10% of the samples yielded concordance >99%. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was assessed for each polymorphism via exact tests by using the HWE function in the R package ‘genetics’. Each patient was assigned a predicted CYP2D6 phenotypic activity score (AS) based on the method recommended by PharmGKB by adding the AS assigned to each of the patient’s two alleles (*3, *4, *4xN, *6, *6xN = 0; *10, *41 = 0.5; *1, *2, *10xN, *41xN = 1; *1xN, *2xN = 2). Each patient’s AS was then transformed into a predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer activity phenotype (poor metabolizer (PM)=0, intermediate (IM)=0.5, extensive (EM)=1.0–2.0, and ultra-rapid (UM)>2.0).[[23](#R23),[24](#R24)]\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nThis analysis had a pre-specified primary outcome and method of quantifying CYP2D6 activity, and was calculated to have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.5 assuming 6% of cases were PM and a sample size of n=500 in each group. The primary endpoint for all analyses was recurrence free survival, defined as the period of time following surgery until first recurrence or death, or censoring due to loss of followup. Overall survival (OS), the time from diagnosis to death or censoring due to loss of follow-up, was used for secondary analyses. Due to the sparseness of very long-term follow-up data, all patients and analyses were censored at 150 months (12.5 years) of follow up. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical characteristics and tendency to be treated with tamoxifen differed between patients obtained from the P01 and SPORE databases, therefore, analyses were stratified by database.\n\nClinical characteristics, genotype frequencies, and outcomes were compared between tamoxifen treated and tamoxifen untreated patients using Chi square or Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests, as appropriate. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify clinical factors (age, progesterone receptor (PR) status, nodal status, tumor size, database) significantly associated with outcome. Genotype data was defined in two ways, in the primary analysis, PM patients (AS=0) were compared to all other patients (AS>0) and in secondary analyses the AS (0–3) was analyzed as a continuous variable. Associations between CYP2D6 PM status (AS=0) and prognostic clinical variables (age, nodal status, tumor size) were analyzed separately in the tamoxifen treated and untreated cohorts using chi square and Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate. Statistical significance of a relationship between genotype and treatment outcomes were assessed using the log-rank test independently in the tamoxifen treated and untreated cohorts. Schoenfeld residuals were inspected and the proportional hazards assumption was tested using the Kolmogorov-type supremum test on 1000 simulated patterns. Variables that violated the proportional hazards assumption (database in all models and PR status in the untreated and combined model) were used as stratifiers in subsequent models. Multivariable models were constructed including significant clinical variables and CYP2D6 genotype to test for independent contribution of CYP2D6. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.3 with two-tailed tests and a standard significance threshold of p<0.05.\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient Characteristics\n\nAfter exclusion of patients missing genetic or clinical information, 476 patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen and 481 patients who did not receive any adjuvant treatment were evaluable for pharmacogenetic analyses (**Figure 1**). The demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics of the patients are reported in **Table 1**. All tumors were ER+ and 77% were PR+. In general, this patient population has favorable prognostic features such as small tumors (48% <2 cm) and low rates of metastasis (66% node negative). There are significant differences between patients who received tamoxifen treatment and those who did not in several of the patient and tumor characteristics including age, tumor size, and nodal status. This expected finding reflects the nature of the non-randomized and community-based cohorts; retrospective population based analysis; patients with more aggressive tumors were more likely to receive additional adjuvant treatment, as decided by their treating physicians. The median follow-up for patients was 121 and 124 months for tamoxifen-treated and untreated patients, respectively.\n\n### Fig 1.\n\n![Fig 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fcc8/6028015/1353bc82555d/nihms-975359-f0001.jpg)\n\nConsort diagram depicting the patient flow from initial selection from the SPORE or P01 databases into the final analysis.\n\n### Table 1:\n\n|   |   | Tamoxifen Treated (n=476) |  | Tamoxifen Untreated (n=481) |  | Tamoxifen treated vs. untreated p-value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| n | % | n | % |  |  |  |\n| Source Bank | P01 | 148 | 31.1 | 59 | 12.3 | <0.0001 |\n|   | SPORE | 328 | 68.9 | 422 | 87.7 |  |\n| Agea | Age <50 | 29 | 6.2 | 74 | 15.5 | <0.0001 |\n|   | Age > 50yrs | 440 | 93.8 | 402 | 84.5 |  |\n|   | Median | 67.0 |   | 66.0 |   | 0.024 |\n| PR | Negative: < 5 fmol/mg | 103 | 21.6 | 117 | 24.3 | 0.32 |\n|   | Positive: > 5 fmol/mg | 373 | 78.4 | 364 | 75.7 |  |\n| Tumor size | < 2 cm | 189 | 39.7 | 272 | 56.6 | <0.0001 |\n|   | >2 and < 5 cm | 264 | 55.5 | 191 | 39.7 |  |\n|   | >5 cm | 23 | 4.8 | 18 | 3.7 |  |\n| Nodal Status | Negative | 241 | 50.6 | 388 | 80.7 | <0.0001 |\n|   | 1–3 Positive Nodes | 163 | 34.2 | 66 | 13.7 |  |\n|   | 4–9 Positive Nodes | 51 | 10.7 | 20 | 4.2 |  |\n|   | >10 Positive Nodes | 21 | 4.4 | 7 | 1.5 |  |\n| CYP2D6 Phenotype | Poor Metabolizer | 28 | 5.9 | 30 | 6.2 | 0.0008 |\n|   | Intermediate Metabolizer | 15 | 3.2 | 23 | 4.8 |   |\n|   | Extensive Metabolizer | 430 | 90.3 | 406 | 84.4 |  |\n|   | Ultra-Rapid Metabolizer | 3 | 0.6 | 22 | 4.6 |  |\n| Months of follow-upb | Median | 110.7 |   | 115.0 |   | N/A |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Summary of patient, tumor, genetic, and outcomes data in tamoxifen treated and untreated cohorts.\n\n### Association between Clinical Variables and Treatment Outcome\n\nDifferences between patient cohorts from the two DNA banks was highly significantly associated with RFS (**Table 2**) and OS (data not shown) in both the tamoxifen treated and untreated cohorts, therefore, all analyses were stratified according to the two cohorts.

All minor allele frequencies were similar to expected frequencies in a predominantly Caucasian cohort[[23](#R23)]. Of note, the common no-activity CYP2D6*4 and diminished activity *41 alleles were within expected Hardy-Weinberg proportions. The CYP2D6*2 allele was not within the expected Hardy- Weinberg proportions, however, this is irrelevant as the *2 allele is categorized as metabolically normal (AS=1), similar to wild-type *1[[24](#R24)]. CYP2D6 diplotype was translated into a predicted activity phenotype for each patient (**Supplementary Table 1**).\n\n### Association between CYP2D6 and Prognostic Clinical Variables\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizer status (AS=0) was not associated with age or tumor size in either the tamoxifen treated or untreated cohorts (all p>0.05, data not shown). A nominal association with nodal status was detected in the tamoxifen treated patients, in which patients with CYP2D6 PM status were more likely to have 10 or more positive nodes (5/28=17.9%) than patients with AS>0 (16/449=3.6%) (p=0.015). A similar association was not detected in the tamoxifen untreated patients (p=0.42), however, the association maintained significance when the treated and untreated cohorts were combined (p=0.026, **Supplementary Table 2**).\n\n### Association between CYP2D6 and Treatment Outcome in Tamoxifen Treated Patients\n\nIn the primary analysis there was no association between CYP2D6 non-PM status (AS>0) and RFS in tamoxifen treated patients (HR=0.68, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.33–1.40, p=0.29, **Table 2, Figure 2 (left)**. A Cox-based survival curve assuming average clinical variables (1–3 nodes, tumor size of 2–5 cm, and 66.5 years of age) is depicted in **Supplementary Figure 1 (left)**. Similarly, in a secondary analysis of AS, as a continuous variable, there was no association with RFS (HR=1.16, 95% CI: 0.84–1.62, p=0.37, **Table 2**). After adjusting for relevant clinical covariates (age, tumor size, positive nodes), CYP2D6 non-PM status (p=0.80) was not associated with RFS, however, there was a borderline significant association of worse RFS as CYP2D6 AS increased (HR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.00–2.04, p=0.05). CYP2D6 non-PM status (p=0.28) and AS (p=0.57) were not associated with OS in tamoxifen treated patients (data not shown).\n\n### Fig 2.\n\n![Fig 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fcc8/6028015/ea76893d2199/nihms-975359-f0002.jpg)\n\nRecurrence free survival curves stratified by CYP2D6 PM Status including 95% confidence intervals (shaded areas) and number at risk (along X-axis). In tamoxifen treated patients (left) there was no association between CYP2D6 genotype and recurrence free survival. In the tamoxifen untreated cohort (right) the patients with CYP2D6 non-poor metabolizer phenotype had significantly better recurrence free survival ((HR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.22–0.89, p=0.023) than patients with poor metabolizer phenotype.\n\n### Association between CYP2D6 and Treatment Outcomes in Tamoxifen Untreated Patients\n\nA parallel analysis was performed in the cohort of patients that did not receive adjuvant systemic treatment. In the univariate analysis CYP2D6 non-PM status was associated with superior RFS (HR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.220.89, p=0.023, **Table 2**, **Figure 2 (right).** A Cox-based survival curve assuming average clinical variables (1–3 nodes, tumor size of 2–5 cm, and 66.5 years of age) is depicted in **Supplementary Figure 1 (right)**. In a secondary analysis of AS as a continuous variable, increasing AS was nearly significantly associated with improved RFS (HR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.51–1.00, p=0.051). In the multivariable model of RFS, nodal status did not maintain significance (p=0.44). In adjusted analyses patients with CYP2D6 non-PM status had superior RFS compared to patients with PM phenotype (HR=0.41, 95% CI: 0.20–0.84, p=0.015) and similar results were found when analyzing CYP2D6 AS as a continuous variable (HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47–0.92, p=0.015). CYP2D6 non-PM status (p=0.83) and AS (p=0.74) were not associated with OS in patients not receiving adjuvant treatment (data not shown).\n\n## Discussion\n\nA number of studies have tested the hypothesis that patients with breast cancer who carry low-activity CYP2D6 genotypes have inferior tamoxifen treatment outcomes. A recent meta-analysis detected a small, but statistically significant, increase in tumor recurrence for patients with diminished CYP2D6 activity, particularly for those who carry two non-functional copies of CYP2D6 (PMs, AS=0)[[16](#R16)]. However, this meta-analysis relied on data from several independent studies, and there is concern that publication bias as well as exclusion of several large studies[[14](#R14),[12](#R12)] may be artificially inflating meta-analysis estimates away from the null hypothesis[[25](#R25)–[27](#R27)]. Therefore, it is important that additional large, well-conducted analyses testing the CYP2D6/tamoxifen hypothesis are published, regardless of their findings. The current study utilized two large breast cancer registries and biobanks with long-term follow up to test for an association between CYP2D6 genotype and recurrence free survival in two subcohorts, one which received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment and the other that received no adjuvant treatment. All patients had ER+ tumors, did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, and CYP2D6 allelic coverage was relatively comprehensive, three factors that have been identified as limitations of many of the previous retrospective studies[[17](#R17)]. In this analysis, there was no decrease in tamoxifen effectiveness for patients with CYP2D6 PM phenotype, though there was evidence of an association in the opposite direction when CYP2D6 activity score quantitatively was analyzed with adjustment for other important clinical characteristics. Additionally, in patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment, higher CYP2D6 metabolic activity was associated with superior outcomes.\n\nAfter adjustment for clinical characteristics, we found that patients with low CYP2D6 activity have superior tamoxifen treatment outcomes. These data contradict the hypothesis that extent of metabolic activation of tamoxifen to endoxifen is a biomarker for therapeutic effectiveness and are consistent with two previous studies[[28](#R28),[29](#R29)]. Analyses of the CYP2D6-tamoxifen hypothesis with the highest strength of evidence, Conducted in large prospective clinical trials, have yielded similarly conflicting results[[14](#R14),[12](#R12),[13](#R13)]. The potential biases and limitations of all studies to date has been discussed [[30](#R30)–[33](#R33)], but the overall equivocal results suggest that a true association, if one exists, is likely marginal and only detectable in the most highly selected cohorts. This conclusion is supported by the results of the meta-analysis from the International Tamoxifen Pharmacogenetics Consortium, which only detected an association with recurrence free survival in a carefully selected subcohort of the overall analysis population[[16](#R16)], a filtering process that itself was debated by the research community[[26](#R26)].\n\nThis study, unexpectedly, detected an improvement in RFS in patients with higher CYP2D6 activity in the cohort who did not receive adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Inclusion of an untreated cohort in pharmacogenetic studies is necessary to differentiate between true pharmacogenetic effects that are predictive of treatment outcome and prognostic genetic effects[[34](#R34)–[36](#R36)]. If the tamoxifen/CYP2D6 hypothesis were true, one would expect to see patients with higher CYP2D6 activity have superior in outcomes in the tamoxifen treated cohort and similar outcomes in the tamoxifen untreated outcomes. In contrast, our results indicate that patients with higher CYP2D6 activity have superior outcomes in the tamoxifen untreated cohort and similar, or perhaps inferior, outcomes in the tamoxifen treated cohort. Contrary to the hypothesis, these results suggest that increased CYP2D6 activity may be a prognostic factor associated with superior treatment outcomes in patients not receiving systemic treatment. If true, this adds an additional layer of complexity to previous studies of the CYP2D6/tamoxifen hypothesis, which did not include a tamoxifen untreated control group. However, skepticism is warranted, as a plausible biological rationale for a prognostic effect of systemic CYP2D6 activity on ER+ breast cancer prognosis is not readily available. The physiological role of CYP2D6 is not well defined as few high-affinity endogenous substrates have been identified. CYP2D6 is responsible for O-demethylation of pinoline[[37](#R37)] and of 6-methoxytryptamine to serotonin[[38](#R38)], which may account for the well-established association between CYP2D6 activity and personality[[39](#R39),[40](#R40)]. It is unlikely, though possible, that these physiological differences are related to prognosis of ER+ breast cancer. CYP2D6 has very weak affinity for testosterone[[41](#R41)], suggesting a possible relationship with ER+ breast cancer occurrence or prognosis, however, associations of CYP2D6 polymorphisms with occurrence of ER+ breast cancer have not been detected in very large genome-wide screens[[42](#R42)].\n\nGenotyping for this analysis was performed using DNA isolated from whole-tumor specimens, and not from peripheral blood. Several studies have confirmed a near perfect concordance between CYP2D6 genotypes obtained from tumor and matched germline DNA[[43](#R43)–[45](#R45)] [[46](#R46),[11](#R11)] and these are in contrast with a single study reporting some discordance between CYP2D6M genotypes, potentially due to somatic loss of heterozygosity (LOH)[[47](#R47)], Tumor LOH has been hypothesized to explain large deviations from HWE in the BIG 1–98 analysis[[12](#R12),[30](#R30)]. In the present study, CYP2D6M was well within expected Hardy-Weinberg proportions, further refuting the hypothesis that tumor genotyping causes meaningful misclassification. Deviations from HWE seen in BIG 1–98 are more likely result from a well-known consequence of population ad mixture [[48](#R48)], similar to the deviations from HWE detected in the multi-center studies included in the ITPC, regardless of whether the genotyping was performed in DNA derived from blood ortumor[[49](#R49)]. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions for the *2 allele, and potential misclassification of *1 and *2, would have no effect on this analysis as both alleles are fully functional alleles with assigned AS=1, based on CPIC recommendations[[24](#R24),[5](#R5)].\n\nOther limitations of this analysis are also worth mentioning. The use of patients from non-trial-based breast cancer biobanks is subject to biases inherent in retrospective analyses[[50](#R50)], including under-ascertainment of recurrence, and several important data elements were not available for some or all patients including menopausal status (available for most), tamoxifen treatment duration and/or adherence, and concomitant administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors. Each of these variables has been hypothesized to be an important consideration in analyses of this pharmacogenetic association[[17](#R17),[16](#R16),[51](#R51)]. Given these limitations, it is critical that our current findings are interpreted in the context of the dozens of previously published studies. The inconsistency of these findings, spanning the full range of effect from protective, null, to enhanced risk, are consistent with random sampling from a distribution with a modest effect, at most. The marginal association, detectable only in carefully selected patient populations, and the relative infrequency of the PM phenotype (frequency«6% in Caucasian cohorts), further support recommendations of ASCO[[52](#R52)] and the NCCN[[53](#R53)] against genotyping CYP2D6 to guide tamoxifen treatment, despite confirmation that doing so is feasible and safe[[54](#R54)–[58](#R58),[15](#R15)].\n\nIn conclusion, in this large, retrospective analysis, patients who received tamoxifen treatment with low-activity CYP2D6 genotype had similar, or perhaps slightly better, treatment outcomes compared with patients with normal or slightly diminished CYP2D6 activity. In a parallel analysis, patients with low CYP2D6 activity genotype who did not receive tamoxifen treatment had inferior treatment outcomes. These findings contradict the underlying hypothesis that low activity CYP2D6 genotype is associated with inferior tamoxifen benefit. These findings further suggest that the true association between CYP2D6 activity and tamoxifen effectiveness, if one exists, is unlikely to be clinically meaningful.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n**Supp Fig 1** Recurrence Free Survival in Tamoxifen Treated and Untreated Patients by CYP2D6 PM-Status.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of CYP3A5 A6986G, ABCB1 (C3435T and G2677T), and SLCO1B1 (T521C and A388AG) polymorphisms on the PK and virologic outcome of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) in HIV-infected children.\n\n**Design and Methods:** \nProspective cohort study in children (4-18 yrs old) on stable antiretroviral therapy with LPV/RTV. CYP3A5, ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 genotypes were determined using PCR amplification with allelic discrimination assays. The 12 hr plasma area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) and clearances (CL) of LPV and RTV were estimated using non-compartmental models.

Allele frequencies of studied genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no statistically significant association between LPV or RTV AUC or CL, and CYP3A5, ABCB1 or SLCO1B1 A388G polymorphisms. There was a significant association between SLCO1B1 T521C genotype and increased LPV AUC (p=0.042) and a nearly significant association with decreased LPV CL (p=0.063). None of the studied polymorphisms including SLCO1B1 T521C were associated with virologic outcome during 52 weeks of study follow up.\n\n**Conclusions:** \nThere was no statistically significant influence of the CYP3A5, ABCB1 or SLCO1B1 A388AG polymorphisms on the PK and virologic outcome of LPV/RTV in HIV-infected children.

Limited data are available regarding the effect of genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of this boosted PI in children.\n\nLPV and RTV are both essential substrates and inhibitors of the CYP3A enzymes, and variations in the CYP3A5 expression have been suggested to be potentially responsible for the inter-individual variability in the absorption and disposition of several PIs.^[1-4]^ In addition to CYP3A enzymes, drug transporters may affect the disposition of PIs into tissues and cells.^[5]^ P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and polymorphisms in the multidrug resistant (*MDR1) (ABCB1)* gene encoding for P-gp have been associated with variability in drug absorption and disposition, drug response, and toxicity of several PIs in HIV-infected adult patients.^[2, 6-8]^ Recent reports suggest an important role in the disposition of PIs of another major hepatic drug transporter: organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP), coded by the *SLCO* genes.^[9, 10]^ The trough concentrations of LPV have been reported to be significantly increased in patients with the *SLCO1B1* 521T>C polymorphism.^[10]^ Reduced uptake of LPV by hepatocytes in carriers of *SLCO1B1* T521T>C genotype has been suggested to be responsible for this effect, but the data on the clinical importance of *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms on LPV PK are lacking.^[9]^\n\nWhile no association between the *ABCB1* polymorphisms and LPV or RTV plasma trough concentrations has been reported in adult patients with HIV infection, in pediatric patients the *ABCB1* G3435T polymorphism has been reported to affect plasma concentrations and virologic response to another PI, nelfinavir.^[11]^ In addition, recent studies of immunosuppressive therapy in children have shown that the effect of *ABCB1* polymorphisms on the PK of cyclosporine is related to age, and thus developmental stage.^[12, 13]^ These findings suggest that developmental changes in ABCB1 activity may need to be considered when evaluating the impact of genetic variants in children. To date no studies have evaluated the role of the CYP3A5, ABCB1 and OATP1B1 expression on the PK and PD parameters of LPV or RTV in HIV-infected children.\n\nThis study was originally designed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in *CYP3A5* A6986G, *ABCB1 (*C3435T and G2677T) affect the steady-state PK and PD of LPV and/or RTV in HIV-infected children. Following recent reports on the significance of *SLCO1B1* expression on the LPV PK in adults, we have also studied the effect of the genetic polymorphisms of *SLCO1B1* (T521C and A388G) on the steady-state PK of LPV/RTV and evaluated the effect of these polymorphisms on the virologic outcome of LPV/RTV based therapy in pediatric patients in our initial study cohort.\n\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\n\nThe study was performed between 2004 and 2009. Pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection (ages 4-18 years), receiving care at a large metropolitan pediatric HIV program at Children's National Medical Center and treated with ARV regimen based on a single PI (including boosted PI), were eligible for study participation. The study represents a subset analysis from the larger pediatric study evaluating the relationship between polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters and the PK of PIs in children.\n\nAll approached patients were recruited from a single perinatal pediatric HIV treatment center with a total of 165 patients with similar characteristics in care. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the IRB at CNMC. Written informed consent was obtained from parents/legal guardians of children younger than 18 years of age. The subject's assent was obtained in children older than 7 years of age, unless a waiver of assent was required. Consent included permission to store the genetic samples at the genetic bank. Prior to study entry, all subjects had received uninterrupted, unchanged single PI based combination antiretroviral therapy, which included LPV/RTV, for a minimum of 4 weeks. Co-administration of medications with a potential interaction with the PI metabolism (such as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and others) was an exclusion criterion. Kaletra® was administered in liquid, capsule and tablet form depending on the child's age, tolerability and formulation availability (Kaletra® [200 mg LPV/50 mg RTV] tablets became approved after the first year of the study).\n\nBlood samples were collected for genotyping during the enrollment. *CYP3A5, ABCB1* and *SLCO1B1* genotypes were determined using PCR amplification followed by allelic discrimination assays based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes (TaqMan) (Applied Biosystems, Niewerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands) and direct sequencing analysis performed on ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Niewerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands). Allele frequencies were identified and all three SNPs were determined to be in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) using a 1 degree of freedom chi-square test.\n\nBlood samples for LPV PK measurement were obtained during a 12-hour admission to the Clinical Research Center within 8-12 weeks after enrollment. The subjects were administered their standard prescribed LPV/RTV dose under direct observation with a standard light snack. The plasma PK samples were obtained before and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after observed intake of LPV/RTV. LPV and RTV concentrations were determined by a published validated tandem-mass spectrometric method using the Applied Biosystems/Sciex API-2000 (Foster City, California, USA).^[14]^ Within-run precision (%CV) was below 7% and between-day precision was below 10% for all analytes at the tested concentrations. Accuracy ranged between 95% and 105%. Loss of assay precision (more than 15%) occurred at concentrations less than 10 ng/mL; hence, results below this limit were censored. The ARV therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) laboratory at CNMC was an accredited member of the International Quality Control Program for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in HIV infection (University Medical Center Nijmegen, The Netherlands).\n\nHIV RNA viral load (VL) (Roche Amplicor, Branchburg, NJ, USA) was measured every 12 weeks for 52 weeks. The lower limit of quantitation for HIV RNA VL was 400 copies/mL. The virological outcome was determined as Study Undetectable VL (SUVL) if ever achieving VL <400 copies/mL during the study duration (52 weeks) or Ever Undetectable VL (EUVL) if ever achieving VL<400 copies/mL while on ARV therapy with LPV/RTV. The historical data on the length of LPV/RTV therapy and associated VL were collected form medical charts and clinical database. Patient adherence to ART was assessed by interactive 3-day-recall interview of the caregivers and children older than 10 years of age and was calculated as the percentage of the number of doses taken over the number of doses prescribed. Adherence was assessed at enrollment, during PK study and at follow up visits every 12 weeks for 52 weeks.\n\nLPV and RTV area under the time-concentration curves from 0 to 12 hours (AUC) were estimated by the linear trapezoidal algorithm using the *R* statistical package (version 2.9.2, R Foundation, Vienna, Austria, available at [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)). Apparent oral clearance (CL) was estimated using the formula CL=F*Dose/AUC, where F is bioavailability. Since F could not be estimated without intravenous dosing, it was fixed at a value of 1 (note that apparent oral clearance will be larger than clearance after intravenous dosing if F is less than 1).\n\nSeveral statistical methods were used to measure the relationships between *CYP3A5*, *ABCB1* and *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms and LPV/RTV AUC, CL and virologic outcome. Analysis of covariance models with adjustment for age was used to assess associations between polymorphisms and single parameters, multivariate analysis of covariance was used for associations between polymorphisms and multiple parameters, and logistic regression models were used to assess relationships between polymorphisms and virologic outcome. LPV and RTV AUC and CL parameters were log-transformed to conform to normality. For the evaluation of the relationship of the CL with selected SNPs CL of LPV and RTV was allometrically scaled. By scaling CL to weight raised to the 0.75 power, size was accounted for, and any remaining relationship with age was independent of body size. All analyses were performed using Stata V10 (College Station, TX, USA).\n\n## RESULTS\n\nThe total number of recruited subjects in the study was 78 with 50 subjects on LPV/RTV based ART. Six patients on LPV/RTV based ART were not included in the study due to medical non-adherence. The LPV/RTV PK and virologic outcome data were collected from 50 children (24 boys, 26 girls) with a median (range) age of 11.2 years (4.3-17.2 years). The majority of the children were African American (43), with 3 patients of African origin, 1 Asian patient, and 3 Caucasian patients, 2 of whom were Hispanic. Median weight was 38.5 kg (15.4-90.5 kg), median height was 139.4 cm (108.7-168.3 cm) and a median BMI was 19.0 (12.8-33.0). Background regimens consisted of 2 NRTIs in 44 (88%) patients, 3 NRTIs in 2 patients, and 1 or 2 NRTIs plus NNRTI in 4 patients (LPV dose adjusted for NNRTI exposure). The median LPV/RTV dose was 275/69 mg/m^2^ (246/62-287/72 mg/m^2^), which is 19.6% higher than currently recommended pediatric dose of 230 mg LPV/57.5 mg RTV/m^2^. The median LPV exposure was 2.2 yrs (0.5-5.2 yrs). Mean self-reported adherence throughout the study period was 88% (41-100%). Of the 50 participants, 27 (54%) patients achieved VL< 400 copies/mL at least once during the study period 52 weeks) and 36 (72%) achieved VL<400 copies/mL at least once ever on LPV/RTV therapy.\n\nOf the 300 possible PK samples, 17 (5.6%) were missing or censored, and were equally distributed within the dosing interval. The median LPV AUC and CL were 96.87 μg*h/L (15.29 - 228.77 μg*h/L) and 0.09 L/h/kg (0.04-0.44 L/h/kg), respectively. For RTV, AUC and CL were 44.73 μg*h/L (0.45-14.90 μg*h/L) and 0.53 L/kg/h (0.15-3.74 L/kg/h), respectively. There was no significant relationship between the age and AUC for either LPV or RTV. As anticipated the AUC and CL of LPV had direct linear relationship with AUC and CL of RTV (r^2^=0.755; p<0.0001 and r^2^=0.755; p<0.0001, respectively). The decrease in CL of LPV and RTV was statistically significantly associated with advanced age (r^2^=0.136, p=0.008 and r^2^=0.178, p=0.002 respectively).\n\nThe allelic frequencies of the polymorphisms for *CYP3A5* A6986G and *ABCB1* (C3435T and G2677T) and for *SLCO1B1* (T521C and A388G*)* were as follows: *CYP3A5* (A6986G) - p(A)=0.583, p(G)=0.417 (HWE p-value=0.113); *ABCB1* (C3435T) - p(C)=0.688, p(T)=0.312 (HWE p-value=0.834); *ABCB1* (G2677T) - p(G)=0.800, p(T)=0.200 (HWE p-value=0.693); *SLCO1B1* (T521C) - p(T)=0.958, p(C)=0.042 (HWE p-value=0.763); *SLCO1B1* (A388G) - p(G)=0.702, p(A)=0.298 (HWE p-value=0.595).\n\nThere was no statistically significant association between LPV or RTV AUC_0-12_ and *CYP3A5*, *ABCB1* C3435T and G2677T, and *SLCO1B1* A388G genotypes. There was a significant association between *SLCO1B1* T521C genotype and LPV AUC (p=0.042), but no association between the same genotype and RTV AUC (p=0.3453). ([Figure 1](#F1)) The *CYP3A5*, *ABCB1* and *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms did not significantly influence CL of the LPV and RTV in children, although *SLCO1B1* 521T>C genotype was nearly significantly associated with an increase in LPV CL (p=0.063).

When adjusted for age, that effect decreased (p=0.067). *SLCO1B1* T521C appeared to have an effect on LPV Allo CL regardless of age. ([Table 4](#T4)) In addition, *SLCO1B1* A388G had clearly some effect on LPV Allo CL.

The *CYP3A5* 6986A allelic frequency is present among approximately 50% in African American populations, and CYP3A5 has been detected in measurable amounts in up to 60% of African American adults.^[15-17]^ The allelic frequencies in our study of predominantly African American children equally demonstrate the higher prevalence of wild-type, active enzyme encoding allele of the CYP3A5 gene. The allelic frequency of *ABCB1* 3435C was seen in majority of our patients in accordance with previously reported high frequency of this allele in the African American population.^[15, 18]^ The incidence of *ABCB1* 2677G allele in our study cohort was higher than reported in the literature for African American adults.^[15, 19]^ The allelic frequencies of *SLCO1B1* 521C polymorphisms are known to be rare in patients of African origin, and were very low in our study population of predominantly African American children (comparable with the data from Brazilian HIV-infected population).^[10, 20, 21]^ The incidence of *SLCO1B1* 388*G* allele was predominant in our population in accordance with published distribution in African subjects. ^[20, 21]^\n\nIn our study neither LPV nor RTV AUC and CL were affected by the *CYP3A5* A6986G polymorphism. These data correlate with previously published data on the lack of effect of *CYP3A5* A6986G on LPV and RTV trough plasma concentrations in adults.^[22]^ The study by Estrela et al. also did not find an association between another *CYP3A5* G14690A polymorphism and trough plasma concentrations of LPV/RTV in HIV-infected adults and ascribed the overall lack of the CYP3A5 influence on the PK of LPV/RTV to the inhibition of the CYPA5 activity by RTV.^[22]^ Both *ABCB1* C3435T and G2677T polymorphisms and their haplotypes also had no effect on plasma AUC and CL of LPV/RTV as previously reported in adult studies.^[23-26]^ The most recent adult study evaluating LPV plasma trough concentrations in plasma, semen and saliva of adult HIV-infected men found no association with *ABCB1* C1236T, T2677A and C3435T genotypes and haplotypes.^[27]^\n\nThe reported effects of the *ABCB1* SNPs on the outcome of LPV/RTV based ART have been controversial. *ABCB1* C3435T polymorphism has been associated with CD4 cell recovery in HIV-infected adult patients by Fellay et al., ^[24]^ but not by other studies.^[23, 28] ^*ABCB1* C3435T polymorphism has been associated with HIV viral load outcome with earlier virologic failure reported in adult HIV-infected patients with 3435CC genotype.^[29]^ These data have not been confirmed by Haas et al.^[23]^, who reported that the allelic *ABCB1* G2677T and C3435T variants were not associated with difference in the rate of phase 1 viral decay. Our study found no association between the *ABCB1* polymorphisms and the virologic outcome in treatment-experienced HIV-infected children.\n\nThis is the first pediatric study to evaluate the effect of the *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms on the PK and PD of LPV/RTV in HIV-infected children. Our data on the significance of *SLCO1B1 T521C* polymorphism on the trough of LPV are consistent with recently published reports from the adult data from Brazil and England.^[9, 10]^ The study by Hartkoorn et al. has evaluated the effect of *SLCO1A1*, *SLCO1B1* and *SLCO1B3* on the LPV plasma concentrations in adult subjects (>18 years) at 10-14 hours post dose (326 patients) and 2-6 hours post dose (293 patients). No data on ethnic/racial background or virologic outcome were available. The study combined the data from clinical database with *in vitro* research evaluating the PI as substrates to the OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in *Xenopus laevis* oocyte model. The data from the *X. laevis* oocyte model showed that the PIs saquinavir and LPV are the two PIs substrates to OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATPB3, and RTV had no inhibitory effect on OATP1B1. In human samples, however, no association was found between *SLCO1A2* and *SLCO1B3* and LPV plasma concentrations. In contrast, the data from human samples showed a significant association between *SLCO1B1* 521T to C polymorphism with higher LPV plasma concentrations at both time points studied. ^[9]^ Significantly higher median plasma LPV C_min_ and C_2-6_ were observed in patients that were homozygous for the C allele at position 521 of *SLCO1B1* compared with either T homozygotes or heterozygotes. The study by Kohlrausch et al. in Brazilian HIV-infected men showed similar association between *SLCO1B1* 521 T to C polymorphism with higher LPV C_min_ when compared with wild-type genotype.^[10]^\n\nIn our analysis of the effect of *SLCO1B1* 521 T to C polymorphism on the PK of LPV and RTV in the pediatric cohort with wide range of ages (4.3-17.2 yrs) the relationship between outcome and genotype could be confounded by a relationship between the outcome and age. When looking at pediatric PK parameters and trying to minimize any confounding of size on age effects, it definitely is best to use size-adjusted parameters (i.e. allometrical adjustment). From our analysis using allometrically scaled CL it appears that LPV CL is related to both age and *SLCO1B1* genotype, and that the effect of genotype is weakly moderated by age, but we acknowledge that the present study has insufficient numbers and low minor allele frequency to make definitive statement about such relationship. It is also difficult to make conclusion about the effect of the *SLCO1B1* A388G on LPV Allo CL, since this SNP had only two genotypes in the database (compared to three means for all other SNPs) which can disproportionally increase the power of analysis for this SNP in the study. ([Table 4](#T4))\n\nFindings of the significant effect of *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms (T521C and A388G) on the PK of other OATP substrates such as statins have been reported and the *SLCO1B1* polymorphism has been linked to be associated with statin-induced myopathy. ^[30-33]^ As a result of these findings, the speculation about the association of *SLCO1B1* polymorphism and increased risk of resistance to LPV and virologic failure has been made. Our study is the first to evaluate the clinical significance of the S*LCO1B1* polymorphisms in HIV-infected patients. In our study cohort of experienced HIV-infected pediatric patients, the *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms (A388G and T521C) had no statistically significant association with virologic outcome (undetectable HIV RNA viral load<400 copies/mL) during the study period or ever achieved with LPV/RTV based antiretroviral treatment regimen. We recognize that CYP3A, ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 expression may be affected by HIV infection and concomitant ARV therapy, and hence may be a confounding variable in determining drug response.^[34-37]^ The full spectrum of the substrates/suppressor/inducer interaction between CYP3A enzymes, P-gp, OATP and ARV therapy and HIV infection is complex and remains to be determined.\n\nFinally, as we reported in our population PK analysis for LPV^[38]^, in this study we also found a significant association between RTV CL and age, due to age related changes in apparent volume of distribution that were independent of weight. For both drugs, the weight-adjusted volume of distribution in L/kg on average diminishes with age, which is likely a reflection of the age-related reduction in extracellular body water as a percentage of total body weight.^[39]^\n\nThe major limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size of this pediatric cohort from our single center. Second, we did not evaluate the contribution of the resistance to ARV drugs to the virologic outcome. Finally, the adherence in the study was evaluated through guardians and an older child self-report and is subject to recall bias.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese data add to our understanding of the factors that contribute to variability in plasma concentrations of protease inhibitors. Our data showed the impact of the *SLCO1B1* T521C polymorphism on LPV AUC and CL. There was no statistically significant influence of the *CYP3A5* A6986G, *ABCB1* (C3435T and G2677T) and *SLCO1B1* A388AG polymorphisms on the PK of LPV and RTV in children. This is the first study to evaluate the clinical significance of *ABCB1* and *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms on the outcome of HIV infection. The virologic outcome of LPV/RTV based antiretroviral therapy was not affected by the *ABCB1* or *SLCO1B1* polymorphisms in the treatment experienced HIV-infected children. Age had a statistically significant effect on the clearance of LPV and RTV. The full spectrum of the substrates/suppressor/inducer interaction between CYP450 enzymes, P-gp, OATP and antiretroviral therapy and HIV infection is complex and remains to be determined.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank the children who participated in this study, their families and caregivers, the clinic staff, laboratory and Pediatric Clinical Research Center personnel for their dedication and support.\n\nThis work was supported by Department of Health and Human Services, NIH PHS grants NIBIB R01 EB005803-01A1(MN, NR), NCRR 1K12 RR017613 (NR), NICHD K231K23HD060452-01A1 (NR), NIAID K23 AI076106-01 (MN), MO1-RR-020359 (NR, JNA), and NICHD 1U10 HD45993 (JNA).\n\nSources of support:\n\nThe authors of this manuscript received support by Department of Health and Human Services, NIH PHS grants NIBIB R01 EB005803-01A1(Michael Neely and Natella Rakhmanina), NCRR 1K12 RR017613 (Natella Rakhmanina), NICHD 5 K23 HD060452-02 (Natella Rakhmanina), NIAID K23 AI076106-01 (Michael Neely), MO1-RR-020359 (Natella Rakhmanina and John van den Anker), and NICHD 1U10 HD45993 and 5K24RR019729 (John van den Anker).\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

This study aims to identify new genetic variants associated with MACE end point during the 18-month follow-up period by a two-stage large-scale sequencing data, including high-depth whole exome sequencing of 168 patients in the discovery cohort and high-depth targeted sequencing of 1793 patients in the replication cohort. We discovered eight new genotypes and their genes associated with MACE in patients with ACS, including MYOM2 (rs17064642), WDR24 (rs11640115), NECAB1 (rs74569896), EFR3A (rs4736529), AGAP3 (rs75750968), ZDHHC3 (rs3749187), ECHS1 (rs140410716), and KRTAP10-4 (rs201441480). Notably, the expressions of MYOM2 and ECHS1 are downregulated in both animal models and patients with phenotypes related to MACE. Importantly, we developed the first superior classifier for predicting 18-month MACE and achieved high predictive performance (AUC ranged between 0.92 and 0.94 for three machine-learning methods). Our findings shed light on the pathogenesis of cardiovascular outcomes and may help the clinician to make a decision on the therapeutic intervention for ACS patients.\n\nSubject terms: Genetic association study, Cardiovascular diseases, Outcomes research\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs a standard treatment procedure for patients suffering from ACS and those undergoing PCI with stenting, dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel in addition to aspirin, significantly reduces the risk of adverse cardiac events in patients [[1](#CR1)]. However, the pharmacodynamic response to DAPT varies substantially among patients [[2](#CR2)].\n\nStudies have reported the associations of several gene polymorphisms (*CYP2C19*2*, *CYP2C19*3, CYP2C9*2*, *PON1* Q192R, and *ABCB1* C3435T) with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ACS and those undergoing PCI [[3](#CR3)–[8](#CR8)]. However, there are meta-analysis studies failed to support the associations of *CYP2C19* and cardiovascular events [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)]. In summary, these studies about the effects of single-nucleotide variants (SNPs) on clinical outcomes were inconsistent and inconclusive. Meanwhile, most of the previous studies were conducted in western populations, Asians have very different genotype distributions of *CYP2C19* and *PON1* Q192R, for example, the allele frequency of *CYP2C19*2* was much higher in the Asian population (35%) than Africans and Caucasians (15%) [[11](#CR11)], *CYP2C19*3* and *CYP2C19*17* in Chinese population was far lower than other populations, and the frequency of the *PON1* 192Q allele in Chinese patients is also relatively lower than in Caucasians [[12](#CR12)], in whom relevant studies based on large samples are scarce. Therefore, it is very necessary to identify the association of genetic polymorphisms with cardiovascular events and offer valuable information for intervention in Han Chinese population. Moreover, previous studies on cardiac adverse events after PCI mainly focused on a few specific genotypes or genes [[3](#CR3)–[10](#CR10)]. Therefore, the majority of the hereditability in affecting cardiovascular events remains unexplained, and other important genetic determinants have yet to be identified. Genome-wide studies, such as whole-exome sequencing, should be conducted to enhance the understanding of this research field.\n\nIn the present study, we combined whole-exome and targeted sequencing to investigate the genetic factors associated with the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients receiving clopidogrel and aspirin treatments after PCI. The logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze 1961 samples in two independent cohorts with detailed clinical information, respectively. This process aimed to evaluate the previously reported cardiovascular outcome-related loci and discovered novel genes/alleles associated with the effect of treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin on 18-month MACE in the Han Chinese ethnic group. In addition, we performed the gene-based analysis to further replenish the candidate gene set that maybe missing in single-variant association analysis. To date, machine-learning methods have not been substantially applied to develop effectively predictive prognostic classifiers for adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, we developed SVM classifier to predict the occurrence possibility of 18-month MACE, as well as to provide a target for therapeutic intervention of patients with ACS.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study population and design\n\nIn this study, we included a total of 1961 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing PCI obtained through Guangdong General Hospital in China from 2009 to 2012. These patients were treated with 12 months of dual-antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel in addition to aspirin following stent implantation. All patients had detailed baseline and follow-up information during 18-month follow-up periods. Patient information was collected based on inpatient and outpatient hospital visits, and telephone contacts with the patients or their family at 1-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months following discharge. During the 18-month follow-up period, trained staff systematically recorded medical conditions of each patient to determine the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). An experienced cardiologist adjudicated the end point through review of source documents obtained from medical records. The major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as a composite endpoint included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke (CT or MR scan confirmed) and repeated revascularization (RR). Repeat revascularization included target vessel revascularization–PCI, nontarget vessel revascularization–PCI, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n\nA two-stage analysis was performed in this study. In the discovery cohort, we randomly selected 168 patients for whole-exome sequencing from the total 1021 individuals who have been diagnosed with ACS, have undergone PCI operation in Guangdong General Hospital, and have taken clopidogrel for treatment from 2009 to 2010, of which 51 had MACE end point during the 1-year follow-up period and 117 did not have any clinical events during 18-month follow-up periods. In the replication cohort, we performed targeted sequencing for all 1793 hospitalized patients with ACS and receiving PCI from 2010 to 2012. As replication, 1703 samples went into subsequent analysis after sample quality control, of which 123 had MACE end point during the 18-month follow-up period and 1580 did not have any clinical events during that period. This study has been registered at [http://www.chictr.org.cn](http://www.chictr.org.cn) on 8 March 2011 (registration number: ChiCTR-OCH-11001198).\n\nThis study was approved by both the Guangdong general hospital ethics committee and the BGI ethics committee. All protocols were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent to take part in the study.\n\n### Sample sequencing in two stages\n\nWe sequenced the whole exome of 168 patients in the discovery cohort. Genomic DNA for each sample was used to produce each exome-captured library with the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome (44MB, Roche) array. Then each captured library was independently sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. Each sample was designed to get high-quality bases with coverage of >90×.\n\nWe sequenced the 6-MB targeted region of 1793 patients in the replication cohort. The targeted region consisted of three parts. The first part was the top associated SNVs with *P* < 0.05 in the discovery stage. The second part was top genes with *P* < 0.05 in gene-based test in the discovery study. Gene-based analysis was performed using the Fast Association Tests (FAST) tool [[13](#CR13)], which includes a series of gene-based methods. Four algorithms, including (i) Gene-Wide Significance test (GWiS); (ii) MinSNP-p and MinSNP-gene; (iii) Versatile Gene-Based Test for Genome-wide Association (VEGAS); (v) the Gates test (GATES), were used to test the gene-based association with MACE. The significant gene (*P* < 0.05) in at least three of the four tests was selected for the targeted region design. The third part was 49 reported genes within the pharmacokinetic and pharmadynamics pathway of clopidogrel, aspirin, statin, or beta-blockers. All the three parts were combined and merged into 6MB target regions. Then the targeted region for each sample was sequenced on Complete Genomics (CG) platform [[14](#CR14)] with high quality and coverage.\n\n### Sample quality control\n\nWe required the samples to meet these criteria: (i) average sequencing depth ≥90× in exome-sequencing stage, (ii) average sequencing depth ≥30× in targeted sequencing stage, (iii) genotype calling rate ≥90%, (iv) not-existing population stratification by performing principal component analysis (PCA) analysis that was performed via the multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedure implemented in PLINK v 1.07 [[15](#CR15)], and (v) not be duplicates or first-degree relatives while evaluating pairwise by identity by descent (IBD). After quality control filtering, 90 samples from the targeted sequencing stage were excluded from subsequent analysis.\n\n### Alignment, variant calling, and quality control\n\nFor Illumina exome-sequencing data, reads were mapped to human genome reference assembly (hg19, GRCh37) with SOAP2 [[16](#CR16)] and variants were detected by SOAPsnp [[17](#CR17)]. The high-quality Illumina SNVs that we defined for each individual had to meet the following condition: sequenced quality ≥Q20, sequencing depth ≥8× and ≤500×, and depth of nonreference allele ≥4×.\n\nFor CG-targeted sequencing data, sequence reads were also aligned to human reference genome hg19 and variations were detected using the CG analysis toolkit (CGATools) which is available at CG website ([http://cgatools.sourceforge.net/](http://cgatools.sourceforge.net/)).\n\nAfter all initial SNV calls from Illumina and CG platforms were generated, further filtering was performed to identify high-confidence SNVs. We required SNVs from discovery and replication studies to meet two conditions: (i) genotype calling rate ≥90%, (ii) minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.01, and (iii) Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) *P* > 1.0 × 10^−6^.\n\nTo evaluate the data quality, we compared the genotypes from the sequencing data with the genotypes called from the genotyping arrays. In the discovery study, the average genotype concordance is 98.6% by comparing 5 genotypes overlapping in the exome-sequencing data and genotyping array data in 126 samples (Table [S1](#MOESM1)). In the replication study, the whole-genome sequencing result of the YanHuang (YH) sample was obtained using CG platform. We evaluated the CG data quality by comparing the whole-genome sequencing result and genotyping results in the YH sample and the genotype concordance was 99.5%.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nAnalysis was performed using PLINK (version 1.07) [[15](#CR15)] and R (version 3.2.3, [http://www.R-project.org/](http://www.R-project.org/)). The demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized using counts (percentages) for the categorical variables (e.g., sex, previous MI, and diabetes mellitus) and mean (standard deviation, SD) for the continuous variables (e.g., age, BMI). A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model [[18](#CR18)] was used to calculate the significance by comparing the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between the groups with and without MACE in the follow-up periods of 18-months. Baseline variables and genetic variants explanation for MACE incidence during the 18-month follow-up were calculated by using a regression-based approach as implemented in the SOLAR-Eclipse version 8.1.1 software ([http://solar-eclipse-genetics.org/index.html](http://solar-eclipse-genetics.org/index.html)).\n\nIn the discovery cohort, we applied the logistic regression to calculate the P values and odds ratio (OR) of SNPs on the clinical end points by adjusting for 17 variables, including the first four principal components PC1–PC4, three demographic (sex, age, and BMI) and 10 clinical variables (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous MI). In the replication cohort, we use the multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression to model the survival time and the incidence of MACE by adding SNPs and the same 17 adjustment variables as covariates to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and *P* value for each SNP.\n\nThe Cox model is expressed by the hazard function denoted by h(t). Briefly, the hazard function can be interpreted as the risk of MACE at time t. It can be estimated as follows:\n\n*h*(*t*)=*h*_0_(*t*)×exp(*b*_1_*x*_1_ + *b*_2_*x*_2_ + …+*b*_p_*x*_p_)\n\nwhere\n\nWe fit the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with coxph() function in survival package in R. The coxph function was written as\n\n>coxph(Surv(time, status) ~age + sex + … + genotypes, data = MACE)\n\nFinally, we performed a meta-analysis of these two datasets, via inverse-variance weighted fixed effect meta-analysis method [[19](#CR19)] based on log hazard ratio and standard error. Before that, the Cox regression model was also implemented for the discovery cohort to get the HR for meta-analysis.\n\nPower analysis was used to investigate if we have enough power to detect the associated SNPs in the sample size of the replication cohort. R package survSNP (version 0.23.2) was used to evaluate the power for SNPs with different HR or MAF.\n\nWe estimated a variant as ‘deleterious’ (or ‘functional’ or ‘damaging’) or ‘benign’ (or ‘nonfunctional’ or ‘neutral’) using Polyphen2 [[20](#CR20)] and combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) [[21](#CR21)] methods. A variant with CADD score >15 was defined as “damaging” as recommended by Itan et al. [[22](#CR22)].\n\n### Gene expression analysis\n\nWe mined four publicly available genome-wide expression data sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database in NCBI, including [GSE27962](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27962) [[23](#CR23)], [GSE48060](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48060) [[24](#CR24)], [GSE7487](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7487) [[25](#CR25)] and [GSE47495](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47495) [[26](#CR26)]. These datasets recorded gene expression data of cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction or myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. After downloading the four publicly available datasets, we first detected the expression data distribution for the eight genes in this study, then we applied log transformation and quantile normalization to the expression data if they were not normally distributed. To compare the gene expression difference between case groups (mainly myocardial infarction (MI) operation) and control groups (sham operation), we used unpaired Student’s *t*-test to compute the significance as GEO website recommended. Data are presented as mean ± SE (standard error). Finally, we corrected for multiple testing of the eight genes and genes having a threshold of *P* < 0.00625 = 0.05/8 were considered to be differentially expressed between two groups.\n\n### ECHS1 plasma experiments\n\nWe randomly selected ACS patients with heart failure (HF) symptoms at NYHA stage II or less (*n* = 61), stage III or IV (*n* = 89) from an independent study cohort. *ECHS1* protein levels were measured in plasma sample using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (ECHS1 ELISA kit, Action-award Biotech co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China) and a Multiskan GO Microplate Reader (Thermo Scientific Inc., USA). The comparison of parameters and *ECHS1* protein levels between patients with HF at stage II or less (*n* = 61) and patients at stage III or IV (*n* = 89) was performed using the logistic regression analysis. Because the distribution of *ECHS1* protein levels was skewed, logarithmic transformation was performed before analysis.\n\n### Prediction of 18-month MACE\n\nThis study used three machine-learning models, including support vector machine (SVM) method [[27](#CR27)], Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) [[28](#CR28)] and XGBoost [[29](#CR29)], to predict the binary phenotype—whether MACE occurred in a patient during the 18-month follow-up. The prediction analysis was completely independent from the association analyses, and all the genetic and nongenetic factors were input for analysis. There are 14,253 SNPs overlapped between the discovery and replication cohorts. After LD pruning (PLINK -indep-pairwise 50 10 0.2), 7246 independent SNPs remained. These 7246 independent SNPs as well as 20 clinical factors entered into the three machine-learning models for prediction. The whole dataset was split into 80% and 20% subsets for model training and testing, using stratified folds by balancing the percentage of samples for each class in train and test. We applied a fivefold cross-validation procedure on the train dataset to select the best hyperparameters. One fold was used as the validation set and the other four folds were involved in parameter tuning and model constructing. We repeated the process until each one of the five folds was used as the validation set once. Then we constructed the final model on the train data using the best parameters and calculated the feature importance. In each model, the factors with feature importance over zero were selected for prediction. Finally, we estimated the predictive performance based on the final model on the test dataset. Feature importance was also output to help us pinpoint the important factors that contributed to 18-month MACE. Three models were utilized so that we were able to compare their prediction performances, which could potentially reduce the bias from simply assessing one model. All the modeling procedures were conducted in Python (v3.7.8) with scikit-learn package and publicly available packages.\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of the patients\n\nTwo independent cohorts were recruited and comprised 1961 patients with ACS who underwent PCI and treated with clopidogrel and aspirin for 6–12 months in accordance with the consensus guidelines. After performing sample quality control, 168 patients were included in the discovery study and 1703 patients remained in the replication study (Table [S2](#MOESM1) and [S3](#MOESM1)). For the total 1871 patients, the average age was 63.3 (±10.7) years, 357 (19.1%) were women, 174 (9.3%) had a MACE endpoint during the 18-month follow-up period. Table [1](#Tab1) shows the association of demographic and clinical characteristics with MACE. MACE was associated with increasing age (65.84 ± 10.17 vs. 63.07 ± 10.74, *P* < 0.001), hypertension (68% vs. 56%, *P* < 0.001), and high creatinine (100.9 ± 85.96 vs. 87.03 ± 44.84, *P* < 0.001) (Table [1](#Tab1)). These combined clinical variables explained 5.80% of occurrence of the MACE, thus suggesting potentially substantial genetic contribution.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Characteristics | β (95% CI) | P value | Variants explanation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age – yrs, mean (±s.d.) | 1.025(1.010–1.040) | <0.001*** | 0.94% |\n| Sex, Men – no.

In the discovery study, we deep-sequenced the whole exome of the 168 ACS patients with a mean coverage of approximately 210× (Table [S4](#MOESM1), Fig. [S1](#MOESM1)). All cases with MACE and controls without MACE were ethnically and genetically well matched (Fig. [S2](#MOESM1)). A total of 127,834 SNPs passed the quality control for the single-variant association analysis. Logistic regression analysis determined 6268 SNPs associated with MACE with *P* < 0.05 adjusting for the covariates **(**Fig. [S3](#MOESM1)). Gene-based association analysis identified 408 genes associated with MACE at the *P* < 0.05 level (Table [S5](#MOESM1)).\n\n### Fig. 1. Description of the study design.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fdca/8602039/141153005fe1/41397_2021_245_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=8602039_41397_2021_245_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nFirst, we performed whole exome sequencing of 168 patients and 51 out of them had MACE end point. After quality filtering, a total of 127,834 variants were subjected to single variant association analysis and 6268 variants showed nominal association (P < 0.05). Gene-based association analyses identified 408 genes associated with MACE (P < 0.05). As validation, the 6MB targeted region including 6268 top SNPs and 408 top genes was further analyzed in additional 1703 patients through multivariable Cox regression analysis. A total of 177 SNPs and 82 genes were replicated in validation datasets. Finally, we performed meta-analysis of the two-stage associations and identified eight genetic variants contributed to MACE (P < 7.98 × 10−6 = 0.05/6268). Then, we performed functional analysis on the eight significant SNPs or genes; further, we developed the first superior classifier for predicting MACE.\n\nTo further replicate the identified associations in the discovery cohort and increase the statistical power of the present study, we performed a replication analysis in an independent cohort of 1703 patients using targeted sequencing. In the replication analysis, a total of 6-MB (million bases) targeted regions consisting of SNP/gene associations discovered above and previously reported, were sequenced with approximately 94× coverage for each individual (Table [S5](#MOESM1), Fig. [S1](#MOESM1)). After performing quality control on the samples and variants, 28,316 SNPs entered the subsequent analyses (Fig. [S3](#MOESM1)**)**. Then, we performed replication analysis on the 6268 SNPs and 408 genes and found 177 replicated SNPs for MACE with *P* < 0.05 both in the discovery and replication studies. Although no SNPs reached the multiple test-adjusted significance in the replication cohort, there are eight SNPs left after multiple-test correction (*P* < 7.98 × 10^−6^ = 0.05/6,268; Table [2](#Tab2)) while performing the meta-analysis of two-stage data.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Chr. | Gene | Variant ID | Stagea | Alleles | RAF | OR/HR+ (95% CI) | Pvalue | Meta Pvalue |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8 | MYOM2 | rs17064642 | i | C/T | 0.083 | 6.48(1.83–15.01) | 2.95 × 10−4 | 1.84 × 10−7 |\n| ii | C/T | 0.064 | 2.40(1.59–3.63) | 3.26 × 10−5 |   |  |  |  |\n| 16 | WDR24 | rs11640115 | i | G/A | 0.712 | 3.13(1.25–3.85) | 2.13 × 10−3 | 3.21 × 10−7 |\n| ii | G/A | 0.694 | 2.08(1.47–2.88) | 2.56 × 10−5 |   |  |  |  |\n| 8 | NECAB1 | rs74569896 | i | G/A | 0.138 | 2.87(1.51–5.45) | 3.87 × 10−3 | 1.31 × 10−6 |\n| ii | G/A | 0.154 | 1.90(1.39–2.61) | 5.91 × 10−5 |   |  |  |  |\n| 8 | EFR3A | rs4736529 | i | G/C | 0.060 | 3.16(1.04–9.61) | 4.25 × 10−2 | 2.52 × 10−6 |\n| ii | G/C | 0.060 | 2.41(1.45–4.27) | 1.95 × 10−5 |   |  |  |  |\n| 7 | AGAP3 | rs75750968 | i | A/T | 0.036 | 3.38(1.05–10.9) | 2.90 × 10−2 | 4.85 × 10−6 |\n| ii | A/T | 0.021 | 3.21(1.83–5.66) | 5.21 × 10−5 |   |  |  |  |\n| 3 | ZDHHC3 | rs3749187 | i | A/G | 0.030 | 6.12(1.17–34.01) | 4.12 × 10−2 | 5.19 × 10−6 |\n| ii | A/G | 0.027 | 2.99(1.26–4.14) | 3.37 × 10−5 |   |  |  |  |\n| 10 | ECHS1 | rs140410716 | i | T/C | 0.018 | 12.01(1.10–104.1) | 1.49 × 10−2 | 6.88 × 10−6 |\n| ii | T/C | 0.015 | 3.32(1.84–5.99) | 6.54 × 10−5 |   |  |  |  |\n| 21 | KRTAP10–4 | rs201441480 | i | A/C | 0.024 | 7.25(1.44–36.56) | 3.12 × 10−3 | 7.26 × 10−6 |\n| ii | A/C | 0.011 | 3.86(1.87–7.99) | 2.72 × 10−4 |   |  |  |  |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Identifying eight genetic variants contributed to MACE.\n\n### Identify single variants and genes associated with 18-month MACE\n\nThe most significant SNP associated with 18-month MACE was rs17064642 at *MYOM2* (*P* = 1.84 × 10^−7^; Table [2](#Tab2)). Carriers of the CC/CT genotype had higher MACE occurrence rates during the 18 months of follow-up compared with noncarriers (17.8% vs. 8.1%; HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.98–3.87) (Fig. [2](#Fig2)). Rs17064642 has moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) of r^2^ = 0.57 (East Asians) with the missense SNP rs34823600 and these two SNPs are located only 16 bp apart (Table [S6](#MOESM1)). Similarly, rs34823600 was also significantly contributed to MACE (HR 2.25, *P* = 5.32 × 10^−4^). Rs17064642 and rs34823600 both coincide with enhancer markers (H3K4me1_Enh and H3K27ac_Enh) in four tissues, especially in heart cell types (right atrium, left ventricle and right ventricle), suggesting this locus may function as an enhancer in heart tissue (Fig. [S4](#MOESM1)).\n\n### Fig. 2.

The red, green, and blue colors represented the genotypes containing two, one or zero copy of the risk allele, respectively.\n\nThe other seven significant associations included *WDR24* (rs11640115), *NECAB1* (rs74569896), *EFR3A* (rs4736529), *AGAP3* (rs75750968), *ZDHHC3* (rs3749187), *ECHS1* (rs140410716), and *KRTAP10-4* (rs201441480) (Table [2](#Tab2)). At *WDR24*, we identified two SNPs associated with MACE, rs11640115 (HR 2.08, *P* = 3.21 × 10^−7^) and rs763053 (HR 1.92, *P* = 8.02 × 10^−7^), which were in high LD (D′ = 0.98, r² = 0.96, Table [S6](#MOESM1)). According to public GTEx [[30](#CR30)] databases, both rs11640115 and rs763053 at *WDR24* showed significant eQTL associations with gene *WDR90* (*P* = 1.16 × 10^−6^) in the heart tissues, including heart left ventricle and heart atrial appendage (Table [S6](#MOESM1)**)**. Evidence from [GSE48060](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48060) [[24](#CR24)] dataset confirmed that *WDR90* transcription was associated with long-term recurrent events following first-time MI (0.122 ± 0.031, *P* = 4.78 × 10^−3^, Table [S7](#MOESM1) and [S8](#MOESM1)). Similarly, we also identified two SNPs at *NECAB1* associated with MACE, rs74569896 (HR 1.90, *P* = 1.31 × 10^−6^) and rs73694346 (HR 1.72, *P* = 4.86 × 10^−5^), which were in strong LD (D′ = 0.96, r² = 0.92). Rs4736529 at *EFR3A* increased the risk of occurring MACE and expression of gene *EFR3A* was significantly upregulated in the coronary artery disease (CAD) patients compared with the control group [[31](#CR31)]. However, *EFR3A* showed significantly decreased expression in the left ventricular remodeling in swine after myocardial infarction cardiac by analyzing the GEO database [GSE27962](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27962) [[23](#CR23)] (*P* = 6.94 × 10^−4^). SNP rs75750968 locates in gene *AGAP3*, which relates to GTP binding and GTPase activator activity. Rs74569896 located in *NECAB1* binds to the protein *GATA3* in ChIP-Seq experiments (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2011) and lack of *GATA3* results in conotruncal heart anomalies in mouse [[32](#CR32)]. Rs201441480 at *KRTAP10-4*, which is a missense alteration that was predicted to be damaging by both Polyphen2 [[20](#CR20)] and CADD [[21](#CR21)] methods, significantly increased the risk of MACE (HR 3.86, *P* = 7.26 × 10^−6^). Together, we discovered eight novel genetic variants associated with MACE and achieved an average of 94% GWAS statistical power for the eight SNPs, of which, 99.7% statistical power for rs11640115 at *WDR24* (Table [S9](#MOESM1), Fig. [S5](#MOESM1)). Fig. [2](#Fig2) showed cumulative proportions of individuals without MACE over 18 months of follow-up under the eight polymorphisms.\n\nSince we got the whole-exome and targeted region sequencing data, we further performed the gene-based analysis and confirmed the significance of the eight genes (Table [3](#Tab3)). Together, we identified eight novel genetic variants and their genes contributed to 18-month MACE.\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Gene | Stage i |  | Stage ii |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gene.

We found that two of eight genes, *MYOM2* and *ECHS1*, showed abundant evidences of decreased expression in cases with major adverse cardiac events, either in previous literatures or in our data analysis. M-protein (myomesin-2) encoded by *MYOM2* or total myomesin is downregulated in cardiac hypertrophy in rats [[33](#CR33)], in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients [[34](#CR34)], or in chronic heart failure [[35](#CR35)]. Similarly, *ECHS1*, as an ischemic post-conditioning (PostC) modified protein, showed significantly decreased expression in the cardiac remodeling group after MI compared with the sham group, by analyzing the two different groups’ expression data from GEO database [GSE7487](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7487) [[25](#CR25)] (7.748 ± 4.319 vs. 4.214 ± 1.668, *P* = 5.46 × 10^−6^) and [GSE47495](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47495) [[26](#CR26)] (11.89 ± 0.11 vs. 12.13 ± 0.04, *P* = 7.28 × 10^−4^, Table [S6](#MOESM1) and [S7](#MOESM1)). Meanwhile, we compared the plasma *ECHS1* protein levels in ACS patients with HF symptoms at New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV (*n* = 89) to those with HF symptoms at NYHA stage II or less (*n* = 61). We found that advanced HF patients showed significantly decreased levels of *ECHS1* protein (215.18 ± 115.67 for stage II or less vs. 161.84 ± 76.67 for stage III or stage IV, *P* = 0.0012) (Table [S10](#MOESM1), Fig. [S6](#MOESM1)).\n\n### Predictive effectiveness of 18-month MACE\n\nOne of the ultimate objectives for identifying factors associated with MACE is to predict whether MACE occurred during the follow-up period of 18 months for ACS patients receiving PCI. Based on all the genetic and nongenetic factors, including all 20 clinical factors and 14,253 genetic variants that overlapped in two-stage datasets (remaining 7226 SNPs after LD pruning), we constructed predictive models for 18-months MACE using three machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM) [[27](#CR27)], Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) [[28](#CR28)], and XGBoost [[29](#CR29)]. These three predictive models showed similar performances, with AUCs ranging between 0.92 and 0.94 from the average of fivefold cross-validation (Fig. [3](#Fig3)). We generated the feature importance score plot from the best-performing model LightGBM and the result was listed in Table [S11](#MOESM2). Among the 7246 independent factors (20 clinical factors and 7226 LD-pruning SNPs), 195 factors were selected as predictors of 18-month MACE with importance score over zero in LightGBM model. Three clinical factors, creatinine (importance score 776), age (score 676) and hypertension (score 46), were identified as important predictors (Table [S11](#MOESM2)), which is consistent with our observational correlation findings (Table [1](#Tab1)). In addition, seven of the eight significant genes were also selected as predictors (Table [S11](#MOESM2)). We further investigated the significance of the SNPs selected by LightGBM for the prediction in our genetic association study. We found that those SNPs that effectively contributed to the prediction exhibited significantly lower *p*-value enrichment (Fig. [S7](#MOESM1)). Thus, the present study developed the first superior classifier for predicting 18-month MACE by selecting the most informative factors that independently contributed to MACE.\n\n### Fig. 3. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves for prediction of 18-month MACE.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fdca/8602039/2a4fd7037841/41397_2021_245_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\nThe predictive effectiveness was evaluated by three machine learning models, including support vector machine (SVM, green), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM, blue) and XGBoost (orange). A total of 7246 independent factors (20 clinical factors and 7226 LD-pruning SNPs) entered into each model for modeling, fitting and prediction.\n\n## Discussion\n\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first genome-wide and large-scale association analysis that integrates whole-exome and targeted sequencing to identify novel genetic variants associated with MACE in patients with clopidogrel and aspirin treatment after PCI. We also investigated the associations of five commonly reported SNPs [[4](#CR4), [6](#CR6)–[8](#CR8), [36](#CR36)–[38](#CR38)] with MACE. Our meta-analysis of the two-stage sequencing data confirmed that *PON1* (*P* = 0.0036) but not *CYP2C19* genetic variants contributed to cardiovascular outcomes in Han Chinese patients (Table [S12](#MOESM1)). Moreover, we identified eight novel genetic variants associated with MACE: *MYOM2* (rs17064642), *WDR24* (rs11640115), *NECAB1* (rs74569896), *EFR3A* (rs4736529), *AGAP3* (rs75750968), *ZDHHC3* (rs3749187), *ECHS1* (rs140410716), and *KRTAP10-4* (rs201441480).\n\nTo further explore the functional evidence of the eight genes that contribute to 18-month MACE, we searched all literatures referring to the eight genes and cardiovascular diseases in PubMed database, as well as mined previously reported publicly available GEO databases. Among the eight genes contributed to MACE, we find the expression levels of *MYOM2* and *ECHS1* are evidently downregulated in cases subjected to adverse cardiac events compared with normal controls. Interestingly, many clues reveal that *MYOM2* and *ECHS1* play an important role in heart function. First, *MYOM2* encodes the M-protein, which is also known as Myomesin-2. Myomesin-2 is the primary myosin M-band cross-linking protein and binds titin in a complex with obscurin/obs1. The protein is key to normal heart function, as evidenced by the associations between heart failure and low expression. Myomesin-2 showed decreased expression in multiple heart diseases or heart attack. An animal model of cardiac hypertrophy driven by the thyroid hormone (T3) in rats showed that the downregulated *MYOM2* causes significant contractile dysfunction (*P* < 0.05) [[33](#CR33)]. In addition, it has been reported that myomesin (encoded by both *MYOM1* and *MYOM*2) protein levels decrease in acute ischemia and in chronic heart failure [[35](#CR35)]. A proteomic analysis agrees with previous reports that the level of myomesin-2 in cardiac tissue is decreased in AMI patients (*n* = 10) compared with control cases (*n* = 11) [[34](#CR34)]. Second, the *ECHS1* protein (short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase) is a multifunctional mitochondrial enzyme with several functions in β-oxidation of short- and medium-chain fatty acids, as well as in isoleukine and valine metabolism. A previous study reported that the mitochondrial protein *ECHS1* could regulate cellular ATP consumption/production and influence the defense response to myocardial ischemic stress [[39](#CR39)]. Haack et al. reported that *ECHS1* deficiency causes mitochondrial encephalopathy with cardiac involvement [[40](#CR40)]. Third, *ECHS1* showed significantly decreased expression in the cardiac remodeling group after MI compared with the sham group in two GEO datasets [GSE7487](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7487) and [GSE47495](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47495). We further confirmed that *ECHS1* contributed to an ischemic heart failure in ACS patients by gene expression experiment. Combining all these evidences, we concluded that *MYOM2* and *ECHS1* deficiency causes dysfunction of cardiac function, which will help us understand the occurrence mechanism of MACE.\n\nApart from identifying the novel genotypes and genes associated with MACE, we improved the prediction of MACE by developing a novel classifier for 18-month MACE, when compared with previous studies [[41](#CR41)–[44](#CR44)]. Previous studies were mainly based on clinical features; no comprehensive and complete genetic makers were available for the prognostic classification of MACE. In the current study, we included all candidate genetic variants of MACE to well construct predictive models. We confirmed genetic variants that significantly associated with MACE that efficiently contributed to prediction of MACE than other less-associated factors (Fig. [S7](#MOESM1)). In summary, we developed the first fine classifier that combined the clinical factors and multiple independently informative genotypes to predict 18-month MACE and achieved high accuracy (AUCs ranging between 0.92 and 0.94 from three machine-learning methods).\n\nThere are two issues that need to be addressed in this study. The first one is that the design of the discovery and the replication studies was different, the discovery stage is designed as the case–control study and the replication stage is designed as the cohort study. There was an obvious time interval between the patient cases and the controls in the discovery study, one is that the event occurred within 1-year old, the other is that the event did not occur within 1.5-years old, which can be clearly divided into case and control, and it is suitable for logical regression analysis. However, the cases and controls were defined as whether the event occurred within 1.5 years or not in the replication study; the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression could model the survival time and the incidence of MACE simultaneously, thus, Cox proportional model is most suitable for replication study. In summary, this study is a complete and reasonable design that the discovery cohort is a screening for candidate target genes and we designed the 6-MB targeted region for further validation in the replication cohort. Although we used logistic regression analysis for the discovery cohort and performed multivariate Cox analysis for the replication cohort, some associations were still verified with each other and proved the reliability and consistency of our findings. The second issue was about the prognostic effectiveness of MACE classifier, we maybe overestimating the performance of the classifier because we have not got more new available independent samples as test dataset. Further validation and more work still need to be done in larger samples or more populations.\n\nIn conclusion, we provide here the first genome-wide, large-scale association analysis on ACS patients receiving clopidogrel and aspirin treatment after PCI. We successfully identified eight novel genes for MACE and found that these genetic variants may regulate the function of nearby genes. Especially, the expressions of *MYOM2* and *ECHS1* are downregulated in both animal models and patients with phenotypes related to MACE. Importantly, we developed the first superior classifier to predict 18-month MACE and achieved high accuracy. These findings will provide clinicians with potential biomarkers for an improved prediction of 18-month MACE and provide new insight on the therapeutics of ACS.\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Guangdong general hospital for sample collection and thank colleagues at BGI-Shenzhen for DNA extraction, library construction, sequencing, and discussions.
