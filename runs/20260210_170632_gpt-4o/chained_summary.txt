Example CORRECT turns (5 randomly chosen)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [1] chain=chain_000058  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    What p-value is reported in Study Parameters 1450807044 (PMID 30648747) for this association?
  Model response: The p-value reported for this association is 2.3E-08.
  Ground truth:   = 2.3e-8

  [2] chain=chain_000086  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    Based on PMID 18535201, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported, contradicted, or not reported: In PMID 18535201, rs216013 is associated with Efficacy, Metabolism/PK outcomes for warfarin. Answer one of: supported, contradicted, not_reported.
  Model response: Not_reported.
  Ground truth:   not_reported

  [3] chain=chain_000025  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does this meet the dataset minimum of N ≥ 30 for study controls? Answer true or false.
  Model response: True.
  Ground truth:   True

  [4] chain=chain_000009  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    Based on PMID 28283692, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele T is not associated with dose of selumetinib in healthy individuals as compared to allele C. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: The paper does not provide specific information about an "Allele T" or "Allele C" in relation to the dose of selumetinib. The pharmacogenetic analysis in the study focused on genetic variants in the *CYP2C19*, *UGT1A1*, and *ABCG2* genes, and found no association between these polymorphisms and selumetinib pharmacokinetics. Therefore, the claim about "Allele T" and "Allele C" is neither supported nor contradicted by the paper, as it is not addressed.
  Ground truth:   contradicted

  [5] chain=chain_000090  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    Based on PMID 29036176, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele G is not associated with risk of drug-induced liver injury when treated with isoniazid in people with Tuberculosis as compared to allele A. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Contradicted.
  Ground truth:   contradicted

  Prompt:
    What p-value is reported in Study Parameters 1184233501 (PMID 24498053) for this association?
  Model response: The p-value reported for the association in Study Parameters 1184233501 is 6×10^-6.
  Ground truth:   = 0.529
