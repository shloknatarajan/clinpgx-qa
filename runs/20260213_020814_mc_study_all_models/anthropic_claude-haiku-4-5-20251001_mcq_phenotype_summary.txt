  [1] type=standard  table=pheno  pmcid=PMC9261480
  Sentence: ABCB1 intermediate activity is associated with increased risk of ______ when exposed to loperamide.
  Options: a) Disease:Alcohol-Related Disorders  b) Disease:Substance-Related Disorders  c) Side Effect:Opioid-Related Disorders  d) Disease:Anxiety Disorders
  Expected: c  Got: b

  [2] type=standard  table=pheno  pmcid=PMC11936550
  Sentence: Genotypes AG + GG is associated with increased likelihood of ______ when treated with cyclophosphamide in children with 
  Options: a) Side Effect:Cystitis  b) Absence  c) Acute  d) Side Effect:hemorrhagic cystitis
  Expected: a  Got: d

  [3] type=standard  table=pheno  pmcid=PMC5712579
  Sentence: HLA-B *39:01 is not associated with likelihood of ______ when treated with lamotrigine in people with Epilepsy.
  Options: a) Side Effect:Maculopapular Exanthema, Side Effect:Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions, Side Effect:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome  b) Disease:Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions  c) Side Effect:Maculopapular Exanthema, Side Effect:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome  d) Side Effect:Maculopapular Exanthema
  Expected: a  Got: Looking at Table 4, which presents associations of individual HLA alleles with LTG-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions in different subgroups:

For HLA-B*39:01:
- MPE: OR = 3.44 (0.31-95.21), P = 0.308 - NOT significant
- SCAR: OR = 12.25 (0.64-234.81), P = 0.175 - NOT significant

The paper explicitly states: "no significant associations were found in LTG-induced SCAR" for HLA-B*39:01.

Additionally, from Table 3, when comparing all LTG-induced CADR cases against tolerant controls: HLA-B*39:01 OR = 7.54 (0.63-89.76), P = 0.131 - NOT significant.

The allele shows no significant association with MPE and no significant association with SCAR (which includes SJS).

c

  Expected: d  Got: b

  [5] type=standard  table=pheno  pmcid=PMC11936550
  Sentence: Genotypes AA + AG is associated with increased likelihood of ______ when treated with cyclophosphamide in children with 
  Options: a) Absence  b) Side Effect:hemorrhagic cystitis  c) Acute  d) Side Effect:Cystitis
  Expected: d  Got: b
