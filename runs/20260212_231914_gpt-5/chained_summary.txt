Example CORRECT turns (5 randomly chosen)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [1] chain=chain_000013  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    Does PMCID PMC8602039 report any quantitative statistic (p-value/OR/CI) for this claim?
  Model response: No. They report statistics for rs74569896 with MACE (e.g., HR 1.90, P=5.91×10^-5), but not for aspirin/clopidogrel efficacy, toxicity, or metabolism/PK outcomes.
  Ground truth:   no

  [2] chain=chain_000009  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: clinical_association
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [3] chain=chain_000021  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    How many cases were included in the study of rs77005399 and sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim in Disease:Infectious disease (PMCID PMC3619396)?
  Model response: 99
  Ground truth:   99

  [4] chain=chain_000023  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does this meet the dataset minimum of N ≥ 30 for study cases? Answer true or false.
  Model response: true
  Ground truth:   True

  [5] chain=chain_000002  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC4640545)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC4640545, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Genotype CC is not associated with metabolism of carbamazepine in people with Epilepsy as compared to genotypes CT + TT. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: supported
  Ground truth:   supported

Example INCORRECT turns (5 randomly chosen)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [1] chain=chain_000018  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation

    Does the confidence interval for the OR exclude the null value of 1.0? Answer true or false.
  Model response: true
  Ground truth:   False

  [2] chain=chain_000004  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Is this finding statistically significant at alpha = 0.05? Answer true or false.
  Model response: true
  Ground truth:   False

  [3] chain=chain_000026  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs201279313 and atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol in Disease:Hypertension (PMCID PMC4752391), what p-value was reported for this association?
  Model response: 2.5×10^-8
  Ground truth:   = 1.10E-07

  [4] chain=chain_000006  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs776746 and everolimus in Disease:Breast Neoplasms (PMCID PMC5519037), what p-value was reported for this association?
  Model response: not reported
  Ground truth:   > 0.05

  [5] chain=chain_000007  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does this meet the dataset minimum of N ≥ 30 for study controls? Answer true or false.
  Model response: false
  Ground truth:   True
