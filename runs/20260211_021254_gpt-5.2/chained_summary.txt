  [1] chain=chain_000001  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC11732454)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC11732454, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: HLA-A *31:03 is associated with decreased likelihood of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome when treated with carbamazepine, lamotrigine or phenytoin. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: supported
  Ground truth:   supported

  [2] chain=chain_000000  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs2231142 and gemcitabine in Disease:Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (PMCID PMC5948914), what p-value was reported for this association?
  Model response: For **rs2231142 (ABCG2 Q141K)** in **NSCLC** treated with **gemcitabine-based chemotherapy**, the reported p-value for the survival association was:

- **Progression-free survival (PFS), multivariate (adjusted): p = 0.007** (CA/AA vs CC; Table 2)

(For reference, **overall survival (OS)** multivariate adjusted **p = 0.080**.)
  Ground truth:   = 0.080

  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC5519037)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC5519037, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Genotypes CT + TT are not associated with concentrations of everolimus in women with Breast Neoplasms as compared to genotype CC. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: supported
  Ground truth:   supported

  [4] chain=chain_000005  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: clinical_association
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [5] chain=chain_000002  turn=4  type=counterfactual_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Would this association remain significant at alpha = 0.01? Answer true or false.
  Model response: false
  Ground truth:   False

  [1] chain=chain_000000  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Is this finding statistically significant at alpha = 0.05? Answer true or false.
  Model response: true
  Ground truth:   False

  [2] chain=chain_000007  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    How many controls were included in the study of rs17577 and bevacizumab in Disease:Breast Neoplasms (PMCID PMC5207665)?
  Model response: 0
  Ground truth:   33

  [3] chain=chain_000007  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC5207665)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC5207665, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele A is not associated with response to bevacizumab in women with Breast Neoplasms as compared to allele G. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: **Contradicted.** In this paper, the *ANGPT2* SNP **rs2515462** (minor allele **A** vs major allele **G**) showed a significant association with pathologic complete response (pCR) to bevacizumab-containing neoadjuvant therapy (adjusted OR 4.31, raw *P* = 0.011), indicating allele **A** *is* associated with response compared to allele **G**.
  Ground truth:   supported

  [4] chain=chain_000008  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
