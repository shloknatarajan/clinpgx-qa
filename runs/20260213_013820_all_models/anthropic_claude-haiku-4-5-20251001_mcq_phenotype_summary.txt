  [4] type=standard  table=pheno  pmcid=PMC9261480

  [5] type=standard  table=pheno  pmcid=PMC5712579
  Sentence: HLA-B *35:08 is not associated with likelihood of ______ when treated with lamotrigine in people with Epilepsy.
  Options: a) Disease:Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions  b) Side Effect:Maculopapular Exanthema  c) Side Effect:Maculopapular Exanthema, Side Effect:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome  d) Side Effect:Maculopapular Exanthema, Side Effect:Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions, Side Effect:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
  Expected: d  Got: Looking at the paper's results regarding HLA-B*35:08:

From Table 4, the paper states:
- HLA-B*35:08 showed significant association with LTG-induced MPE when compared with general population (OR = 109.44, P = 0.020)
- For SCAR group: "no significant associations were found"

The text explicitly states: "In contrast to the LTG-induced MPE group, there were no significant differences between HLA alleles and LTG-induced SCAR group."

Therefore, HLA-B*35:08 is NOT associated with SCAR (which includes SJS and DRESS), but IS associated with MPE.

The answer is: **a**
