  Raw response: Looking at the paper, I need to find the association for KCNJ11 rs2285676 and its p-value.

From Table 6 and the results section on genetic polymorphisms:

For KCNJ11 rs2285676 **CC** genotype (not GG

  Expected significance: not found
  Response significance: parse_error
  Raw response: Looking at the paper, I need to find the association for rs3765467 in the DPP4 gene with sitagliptin efficacy where genotype TT is associated with decreased response.

However, examining the paper car

  Raw response: Looking at the paper, I need to find the association for rs2909451 in relation to the gene and drug mentioned.

From the paper, rs2909451 is associated with the **DPP-4 gene** (not KCNJ11), and the **
