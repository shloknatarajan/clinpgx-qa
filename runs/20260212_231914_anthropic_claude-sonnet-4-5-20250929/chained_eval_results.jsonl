This means the **T allele** (variant allele) is associated with:\n   - Enhanced promoter activity\n   - Increased GGH protein expression\n   - Decreased accumulation of polyglutamated MTX\n\n3. The paper also references a study showing that patients with the **TT genotype** had lower MTXPG3-5 levels compared to those with the C allele.\n\n4.
