  [1] chain=chain_000023  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: **clinical_association**

This annotation represents a clinical association study. The paper examines the relationship between genetic polymorphisms (COMT rs4680 and DRD2 variants) and clinical outcomes (efficacy and safety of methylphenidate treatment) in patients with ADHD and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. It assesses whether specific alleles are associated with treatment response in a patient population, rather than investigating the functional/molecular mechanisms of how these variants affect protein function or drug metabolism in laboratory assays.
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  Prompt:
    How many cases were included in the study of rs1800497 and methylphenidate in Other:Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Other:Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (PMCID PMC9031832)?
  Model response: Based on PMCID PMC9031832, **114 cases** were included in the study of rs1800497 and methylphenidate treatment.

The paper states: "Within the study group, i.e., 303 children with hPAE, 114 children were included in the methylphenidate treatment."

These 114 children with ADHD who received methylphenidate treatment were the ones for whom the genetic analysis of rs1800497 (and other polymorphisms) in relation to treatment efficacy and safety was conducted. This included 71 children with morphological FASD features and 43 without morphological FASD features (NFC).
  Ground truth:   114

  [3] chain=chain_000011  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs10264272 and tacrolimus in Disease:Kidney Transplantation, Disease:Transplantation (PMCID PMC6021962), what p-value was reported for this association?
  Model response: Based on the paper PMC6021962, for the study of rs10264272 (CYP3A5*6) and tacrolimus in kidney transplantation:

**In European-American cohort:** The variant was not analyzed (NA) due to low minor allele frequency (MAF = 0.001)

**In African-American cohort:** The p-value reported was **0.269** (with Beta = 0.067, MAF = 0.123)

The paper notes that while this variant was present in the African-American cohort at a higher frequency (12.3%), it did not reach statistical significance (p < 0.001 threshold after multiple testing correction). The authors specifically mention that "The LoF variant CYP3A5*6 was not statistically significant in this analysis, but is likely due to the low number of individuals with this variant in the AA cohort."
  Ground truth:   = 0.269

  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: Based on the paper PMCID PMC5488790, this annotation represents **clinical_association**.

The study is a retrospective clinical study that examined 81 patients who received irinotecan-based chemotherapy and analyzed the relationship between their UGT1A1*6/*28 genotypes and clinical outcomes (adverse reactions like neutropenia, diarrhea, and treatment efficacy). The paper:

1. Collected blood samples from patients for genotyping
2. Recorded clinical adverse events using NCI-CTCAE criteria
3. Performed statistical analyses to correlate genotypes with clinical outcomes
4. Did not conduct laboratory experiments to assess the functional impact of these genetic variants on enzyme activity

This is observational clinical research examining associations between genetic variants and patient outcomes in real-world clinical practice, not a functional assay measuring the biological activity of the UGT1A1 enzyme variants.
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [5] chain=chain_000020  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does the confidence interval for the HR exclude the null value of 1.0? Answer true or false.
  Model response: **False**

The confidence interval for the HR is 0.74-1.57, which **includes** the null value of 1.0. Therefore, it does not exclude the null value.
  Ground truth:   False

    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC5354739, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele C is associated with increased concentrations of methotrexate in children with as compared to allele T. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Based on the paper PMC5354739, I need to look for evidence about allele C versus allele T associations with methotrexate concentrations.

The paper discusses the **GGH rs3758149** polymorphism, which is a **C>T** variant. According to the paper:

1. In the Introduction section, it states: "The *GGH* -401C>T (rs3758149) variant enhances promoter activity, increasing protein expression. Increased levels of GGH lead to a decreased accumulation of polyglutamated MTX and MTX-resistance."

2. This means the **T allele** (variant allele) is associated with:
   - Enhanced promoter activity
   - Increased GGH protein expression
   - Decreased accumulation of polyglutamated MTX

3. The paper also references a study showing that patients with the **TT genotype** had lower MTXPG3-5 levels compared to those with the C allele.

4. In the Results section, GGH rs3758149 was found to be relevant for AUC0-48

    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC11062152, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported, contradicted, or not reported: In PMC11062152, UGT1A1*1, UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28 is associated with Dosage, Efficacy outcomes for fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin. Answer one of: supported, contradicted, not_reported.
  Model response: Based on the paper PMC11062152, the claim is **supported**.

The study investigated risk factors for adverse events (not efficacy outcomes) of nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and L-leucovorin (nal-IRI/FL) treatment, with a focus on UGT1A1 polymorphisms.

Key findings related to the claim:

1. **Dosage**: The paper reports that initial nal-IRI doses differed by UGT1A1 genotype:
   - Wild-type (–/–): 56 mg/m²
   - Heterozygous (+/–): 56 mg/m²
   - Homozygous (+/+): 48 mg/m² (significantly lower, p=0.011)

2. **Safety/Toxicity outcomes** (which relate to dosage decisions):
   - Patients with UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) exhibited significantly lower nadir counts of white blood cells (p=0.033) and neutrophils (p=0

    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC4039076, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele A is associated with increased minimal residual disease when treated with asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, leucovorin, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, pegaspargase, prednisone, thioguanine and vincristine in children with Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma as compared to allele C. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Based on the paper PMC4039076, this claim is **contradicted**.

The paper describes associations between GATA3 SNP rs3824662 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) outcomes. According to the results:

1. The risk allele at rs3824662 is allele **A** (referred to as the "risk allele" throughout the paper)

2. The paper states that "GATA3 SNP genotype was also associated with early treatment response and the risk of ALL relapse" (from the Abstract)

3. In the Methods section, it mentions examining associations with "Pharmacogenetics of minimal residual disease response" (Reference 29)

4. The paper indicates that the A allele (risk allele) is associated with **worse** outcomes, including:
   - Higher risk of Ph-like ALL
   - Association with high-risk somatic lesions
   - Association with relapse risk

Since the A allele is associated with poorer treatment response and higher relapse risk, it would be associated with **higher** (not lower) minimal residual disease compared to the C allele. The claim states that all

    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC5558540, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported, contradicted, or not reported: In PMC5558540, rs4141964 is associated with Toxicity outcomes for morphine. Answer one of: supported, contradicted, not_reported.
  Model response: Based on the paper PMCID PMC5558540, the claim is **supported**.

The paper reports that rs4141964 is associated with toxicity outcomes related to morphine use. Specifically:

1. In Table 3, rs4141964 shows a significant association with hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR), which is a measure of morphine-induced respiratory depression (β = -0.633, p < 0.0001).

2. The paper states: "We found significant FAAH–morphine interaction for missense (rs324420) and several regulatory variants, with HCVR (p < 0.0001) and vomiting (p = 0.0339)." While rs4141964 shows associations with HCVR, it has nominal associations with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (p = 0.1767).

3. The paper also notes in the previous study mentioned in the introduction: "In our previous prospective genotype-blinded study in 259 white children aged 6–15 years, undergoing tonsill

    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC6021962, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele T is not associated with trough concentration of tacrolimus in people with Kidney Transplantation and Transplantation as compared to allele C. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Based on the paper PMC6021962, the answer is: **contradicted**

The paper examined multiple genetic variants including several that involve T/C alleles (such as in ABCB1, IL10, and other genes). While the paper's main conclusion was that only variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were significantly associated with tacrolimus trough concentrations, the claim states that "Allele T is not associated" - which is contradicted by the findings.

Specifically, the paper found:

1. Multiple CYP3A variants (which include T/C polymorphisms) WERE significantly associated with tacrolimus trough concentrations
2. For example, CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367), which is a C>T variant, showed significant association (p = 4.81E-19 in European-Americans)
3. Several other T/C variants in the CYP3A locus showed significant associations

Therefore, the claim that "Allele T is not associated with trough concentration" is contradicted by this paper's findings, since specific T alleles (particularly in
