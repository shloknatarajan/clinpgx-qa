  [1] chain=chain_000047  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC2042718)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC2042718, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: CYP2D6 *17/*17 is associated with decreased metabolism of debrisoquine in healthy individuals as compared to CYP2D6 *1/*1 + *1/*2 + *1/*17. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Supported
  Ground truth:   supported

  [2] chain=chain_000027  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC12032684)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC12032684, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Genotypes CC + CT is associated with increased likelihood of statin-related myopathy when treated with atorvastatin in people with Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes Mellitus, Acute coronary syndrome or Dyslipidaemia as compared to genotype TT. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Supported.
  Ground truth:   supported

  [3] chain=chain_000003  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does the confidence interval for the OR exclude the null value of 1.0? Answer true or false.
  Model response: True.
  Ground truth:   True

  [4] chain=chain_000010  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: clinical_association
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [5] chain=chain_000016  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC4864175)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC4864175, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele T is not associated with risk of cognitive dysfunction due to opioids in people with Neoplasms as compared to allele G. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Supported
  Ground truth:   supported

  [1] chain=chain_000045  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC4519434)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC4519434, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele T is associated with increased risk of Heroin Dependence due to heroin as compared to allele C. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: The claim is contradicted. The paper finds that the rs3778150-C allele, not the T allele, is associated with increased risk of heroin addiction.
  Ground truth:   supported

  [2] chain=chain_000010  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs2046934 and aspirin, clopidogrel in Efficacy (PMCID PMC5331771), what confidence interval was reported?
  Model response: The paper does not specifically report a confidence interval for the study of rs2046934 in relation to the efficacy of treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel. The results related to rs2046934, a polymorphism in the P2Y12 gene, are discussed in terms of associations with high on-treatment platelet reactivity and clinical endpoints, but specific confidence intervals are not provided in the context of efficacy in the study.
  Ground truth:   1.64–3.53

  [3] chain=chain_000031  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC5721751)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC5721751, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele C is associated with decreased response to atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide in people with Hypertension as compared to allele T. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: The claim is contradicted. The paper identifies that allele T of the SNP rs261316 in the gene ALDH1A2 is associated with an increased odds of uncontrolled blood pressure on a combination therapy of atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide. This indicates that the presence of allele T, not allele C, is associated with decreased response to the treatment in the context discussed.
  Ground truth:   supported

  [4] chain=chain_000014  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    ## Paper (PMCID PMC5538123)
    
    <paper>
    
    ## Question
    
    Based on PMCID PMC5538123, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele A is not associated with response to risperidone in people with Schizophrenia as compared to allele G. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Contradicted.
  Ground truth:   supported

  [5] chain=chain_000004  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Is this finding statistically significant at alpha = 0.05? Answer true or false.
  Model response: True.
  Ground truth:   False
