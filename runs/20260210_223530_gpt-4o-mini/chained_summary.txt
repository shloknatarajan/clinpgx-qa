Example CORRECT turns (5 randomly chosen)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [1] chain=chain_000056  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: The annotation represents a clinical association.
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [2] chain=chain_000004  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    Based on PMID 26699619, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Genotype TT is associated with increased rapid virological response (rvr) when treated with peginterferon alfa-2a, peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in people with Hepatitis C, Chronic as compared to genotypes GG + GT. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: Supported. The study found that the preferable genotype TT (rs8099917) was associated with higher rates of rapid virological response (RVR) compared to non-preferable genotypes (GG + GT).
  Ground truth:   supported

  [3] chain=chain_000005  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: The annotation represents a clinical association.
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [4] chain=chain_000090  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    How many cases were included in the study of rs12539 and cannabidiol in Other:Epilepsy (PMID 34464454)?
  Model response: A total of 112 cases were included in the study of rs12539 and cannabidiol in the context of epilepsy (PMID 34464454).
  Ground truth:   112

  [5] chain=chain_000047  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Is this finding statistically significant at alpha = 0.05? Answer true or false.
  Model response: False.
  Ground truth:   False

Example INCORRECT turns (5 randomly chosen)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [1] chain=chain_000005  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs10499563 and tacrolimus in Other:Kidney Transplantation (PMID 32153387), what confidence interval was reported?
  Model response: The confidence interval reported for the odds ratio of the IL6 -6331C/C genotype compared to T/T genotype was 95% confidence interval (1.7 to 25.8).
  Ground truth:   0.9–6.9

  [2] chain=chain_000088  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs12979860 and peginterferon alfa-2a, peginterferon alfa-2b, ribavirin in Disease:Hepatitis C virus infection (PMID 26098993), what p-value was reported for this association?
  Model response: The p-value reported for the association between the favorable *IFNL4* genotype CC and increased sustained virological response (SVR) was 0.021.
  Ground truth:   = 0.008

  [3] chain=chain_000049  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    Does PMID 29027195 report any quantitative statistic (p-value/OR/CI) for this claim?
  Model response: Yes, PMID 29027195 reports a p-value of 0.013 for the association of the TSPYL1 rs3828743 SNP variant allele (A) with worse response to abiraterone, and an odds ratio (OR) of 2.47 (1.23, 4.96) for nonresponders. Additionally, a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34–8.40; p = 0.01) is reported for progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with the AA genotype compared to the GG genotype.
  Ground truth:   no

  [4] chain=chain_000048  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    Based on PMID 25744370, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Allele A is not associated with risk of Heroin Dependence due to heroin as compared to allele C. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: The claim is supported. The study found that allele A (rs1799971-A) was not significantly associated with heroin addiction risk when analyzed alone, while allele C (rs3778150-C) was associated with increased risk. Therefore, the statement that allele A is not associated with risk of Heroin Dependence compared to allele C is supported by the findings of the research.
  Ground truth:   contradicted

  [5] chain=chain_000038  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    For the study of rs2725252 and imatinib in Disease:Chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 positive (PMID 24123600), what p-value was reported for this association?
  Model response: The p-value reported for the association of rs2725252 with imatinib response in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was 0.012 in the exploratory cohort (SLEC) and 0.047 in the 400 mg/d arm of the validation cohort (SVC).
  Ground truth:   = 0.025
