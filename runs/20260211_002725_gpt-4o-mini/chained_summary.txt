Example CORRECT turns (5 randomly chosen)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [1] chain=chain_000040  turn=3  type=statistical_extraction
  Prompt:
    How many cases were included in the study of HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*44:03 and trichloroethylene in Toxicity (PMID 18007983)?
  Model response: The study included 113 cases with TCE-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis. Among these, HLA-B*44 alleles were present in 6.2% (7 out of 113) of the patients.
  Ground truth:   113

  [2] chain=chain_000045  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does the confidence interval for the OR exclude the null value of 1.0? Answer true or false.
  Model response: False. The confidence interval for the OR (0.93-1.59) includes the null value of 1.0.
  Ground truth:   False

  [3] chain=chain_000002  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: The annotation represents a clinical association.
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [4] chain=chain_000003  turn=2  type=evidence_provenance_localization
  Prompt:
    What type of evidence does this annotation represent: clinical association or functional assay? Answer one of: clinical_association, functional_assay.
  Model response: Clinical association.
  Ground truth:   clinical_association

  [5] chain=chain_000042  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Is this finding statistically significant at alpha = 0.05? Answer true or false.
  Model response: True.
  Ground truth:   True

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example INCORRECT turns (5 randomly chosen)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [1] chain=chain_000007  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does this meet the dataset minimum of N ≥ 30 for study controls? Answer true or false.
  Model response: **False.** The study does not provide a specific number of controls for rs17577, and it does not indicate that the dataset meets the minimum of N ≥ 30 for study controls.
  Ground truth:   True

  [2] chain=chain_000018  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does the confidence interval for the OR exclude the null value of 1.0? Answer true or false.
  Model response: True. The confidence interval (0.16–0.82) for the OR does not include the null value of 1.0.
  Ground truth:   False

  [3] chain=chain_000004  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Is this finding statistically significant at alpha = 0.05? Answer true or false.
  Model response: True.
  Ground truth:   False

  [4] chain=chain_000001  turn=4  type=objective_evaluation
  Prompt:
    Does the confidence interval for the OR exclude the null value of 1.0? Answer true or false.
  Model response: False. The confidence intervals for the odds ratios (ORs) reported in the study do not include the null value of 1.0 for the associations mentioned. However, since HLA-A*31:03 was not associated with any outcomes in the study, there is no specific OR or confidence interval for that allele.
  Ground truth:   True

  [5] chain=chain_000010  turn=1  type=claim_verification
  Prompt:
    Based on PMID 28255319, is the following pharmacogenomic claim supported or contradicted: Genotypes AG + GG are associated with increased platelet reactivity when treated with aspirin and clopidogrel as compared to genotype AA. Answer one of: supported, contradicted.
  Model response: The claim is contradicted. The study specifically discusses the effects of CYP2C19 and P2Y12 polymorphisms on platelet reactivity, but does not mention genotypes AG + GG in relation to increased platelet reactivity compared to genotype AA. Instead, it highlights that CYP2C19*2 and P2Y12 mutations are associated with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR), while CYP2C19*17 is associated with improved platelet reactivity.
  Ground truth:   supported
