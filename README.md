# ClinPgx QA Dataset

## Goal
Take human annotated variants and sentences and create a dataset for QA. We also provide markdown files for each of the papers generated using [pubmed-markdown](https://github.com/shloknatarajan/pubmed-markdown).

## Data
The data is in the `data` directory. The `variant_bench.jsonl` and `sentence_bench.jsonl` files contain the human annotated variants and sentences respectively. The `papers` directory contains the markdown files for each of the papers.
